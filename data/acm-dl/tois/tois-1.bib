abstract = {Government documents must be manually reviewed to identify any sensitive information, e.g., confidential information, before being publicly archived. However, human-only sensitivity review is not practical for born-digital documents due to, for example, the volume of documents that are to be reviewed. In this work, we conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of sensitivity classification for assisting human sensitivity reviewers. We evaluate how the accuracy and confidence levels of sensitivity classification affects the number of documents that are correctly judged as being sensitive (reviewer accuracy) and the time that it takes to sensitivity review a document (reviewing speed). In our within-subject study, the participants review government documents to identify real sensitivities while being assisted by three sensitivity classification treatments, namely None (no classification predictions), Medium (sensitivity predictions from a simulated classifier with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 0.7), and Perfect (sensitivity predictions from a classifier with an accuracy of 1.0). Our results show that sensitivity classification leads to significant improvements (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05) in reviewer accuracy in terms of BAC (+37.9% Medium, +60.0% Perfect) and also in terms of F2 (+40.8% Medium, +44.9% Perfect). Moreover, we show that assisting reviewers with sensitivity classification predictions leads to significantly increased (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05) mean reviewing speeds (+72.2% Medium, +61.6% Perfect). We find that reviewers do not agree with the classifier significantly more as the classifier’s confidence increases. However, reviewing speed is significantly increased when the reviewers agree with the classifier (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). Our in-depth analysis shows that when the reviewers are not assisted with sensitivity predictions, mean reviewing speeds are 40.5% slower for sensitive judgements compared to not-sensitive judgements. However, when the reviewers are assisted with sensitivity predictions, the difference in reviewing speeds between sensitive and not-sensitive judgements is reduced by ˜10%, from 40.5% to 30.8%. We also find that, for sensitive judgements, sensitivity classification predictions significantly increase mean reviewing speeds by 37.7% when the reviewers agree with the classifier’s predictions (t-test, p &lt; 0.05). Overall, our findings demonstrate that sensitivity classification is a viable technology for assisting human reviewers with the sensitivity review of digital documents.},

abstract = {With the large quantity of textual information produced on the Internet, a critical necessity is to filter out the irrelevant information and organize the rest into categories of interest (e.g., an emerging event). However, supervised-learning document filtering methods heavily rely on a large number of labeled documents for model training. Manually identifying plenty of positive examples for each category is expensive and time-consuming. Also, it is unrealistic to cover all the categories from an evolving text source that covers diverse kinds of events, user opinions, and daily life activities. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based deep relevance model for few-shot document filtering (named ADRM), inspired by the relevance feedback methodology proposed for ad hoc retrieval. ADRM calculates the relevance score between a document and a category by taking a set of seed words and a few seed documents relevant to the category. It constructs the category-specific conceptual representation of the document based on the corresponding seed words and seed documents. Specifically, to filter irrelevant yet noisy information in the seed documents, ADRM employs two types of attention mechanisms (namely whole-match attention and max-match attention) and generates category-specific representations for them. Then ADRM is devised to extract the relevance signals by modeling the hidden feature interactions in the word embedding space. The relevance signals are extracted through a gated convolutional process, a self-attention layer, and a relevance aggregation layer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that ADRM consistently outperforms the existing technical alternatives, including the conventional classification and retrieval baselines, and the state-of-the-art deep relevance ranking models for few-shot document filtering. We also perform an ablation study to demonstrate that each component in ADRM is effective for enhancing filtering performance. Further analysis shows that ADRM is robust under varying parameter settings.},

abstract = {Technology-Assisted Reviews (TAR) aim to expedite document reviewing (e.g., medical articles or legal documents) by iteratively incorporating machine learning algorithms and human feedback on document relevance. Continuous Active Learning (CAL) algorithms have demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods in efficiently identifying relevant documents. One of the key challenges for CAL algorithms is deciding when to stop displaying documents to reviewers. Existing work either lacks transparency—it provides an ad-hoc stopping point, without indicating how many relevant documents are still not found, or lacks efficiency by paying an extra cost to estimate the total number of relevant documents in the collection prior to the actual review.In this article, we handle the problem of deciding the stopping point of TAR under the continuous active learning framework by jointly training a ranking model to rank documents, and by conducting a “greedy” sampling to estimate the total number of relevant documents in the collection. We prove the unbiasedness of the proposed estimators under a with-replacement sampling design, while experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach, similar to CAL, effectively retrieves relevant documents; but it also provides a transparent, accurate, and effective stopping point.},

abstract = {Natural language inference (NLI) is the task of detecting the existence of entailment or contradiction in a given sentence pair. Although NLI techniques could help numerous information retrieval tasks, most solutions for NLI are neural approaches whose lack of interpretability prohibits both straightforward integration and diagnosis for further improvement. We target the task of generating token-level explanations for NLI from a neural model. Many existing approaches for token-level explanation are either computationally costly or require additional annotations for training. In this article, we first introduce a novel method for training an explanation generator that does not require additional human labels. Instead, the explanation generator is trained with the objective of predicting how the model’s classification output will change when parts of the inputs are modified. Second, we propose to build an explanation generator in a multi-task learning setting along with the original NLI task so the explanation generator can utilize the model’s internal behavior. The experiment results suggest that the proposed explanation generator outperforms numerous strong baselines. In addition, our method does not require excessive additional computation at prediction time, which renders it an order of magnitude faster than the best-performing baseline.},

Limited research efforts, thus far, have been dedicated to the privacy detection from users’ unstructured data (i.e., UGCs). Moreover, existing efforts mainly focus on applying conventional machine learning techniques directly to traditional hand-crafted privacy-oriented features, ignoring the powerful representing capability of the advanced neural networks. In light of this, in this article, we present a fine-grained privacy detection network&nbsp;(GrHA) equipped with graph-regularized hierarchical attentive representation learning. In particular, the proposed GrHA explores the semantic correlations among personal aspects with graph convolutional networks to enhance the regularization for the UGC representation learning, and, hence, fulfil effective fine-grained privacy detection. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art competitors in terms of eight standard metrics.

abstract = {Stance detection on social media aims to identify the stance of social media users toward a topic or claim, which can provide powerful information for various downstream tasks. Many existing stance detection approaches neglect to model the deep semantic representation information in tweets and do not explore aggregating the hierarchical features among words, thus degrading performance. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel deep learning approach Pretrained Embeddings for Stance Detection with Hierarchical Capsule Network (PE-HCN) without complicated preprocessing. Specifically, PE-HCN first adopts a pretrained language model and then uses a related textual entailment task for fine-tuning to obtain the deep textual representations of tweets. The PE-HCN approach extends the dynamic routing scheme to cope with these deep textual representations by utilizing primary capsules for routing the information among words in each tweet and applying secondary capsules to transmit the aggregated features to each category capsule accordingly. Moreover, to improve the confidences of the category capsules, we design an adaptive feedback mechanism to dynamically strengthen the routing signals. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, the extensive results exhibit that PE-HCN achieves competitive improvements of up to 6.32%, 2.09%, and 1.8%, respectively.},

abstract = {The semantic mismatch between query and document terms—i.e., the semantic gap—is a long-standing problem in Information Retrieval (IR). Two main linguistic features related to the semantic gap that can be exploited to improve retrieval are synonymy and polysemy. Recent works integrate knowledge from curated external resources into the learning process of neural language models to reduce the effect of the semantic gap. However, these knowledge-enhanced language models have been used in IR mostly for re-ranking and not directly for document retrieval.We propose the Semantic-Aware Neural Framework for IR (SAFIR), an unsupervised knowledge-enhanced neural framework explicitly tailored for IR. SAFIR jointly learns word, concept, and document representations from scratch. The learned representations encode both polysemy and synonymy to address the semantic gap. SAFIR can be employed in any domain where external knowledge resources are available. We investigate its application in the medical domain where the semantic gap is prominent and there are many specialized and manually curated knowledge resources. The evaluation on shared test collections for medical literature retrieval shows the effectiveness of SAFIR in terms of retrieving and ranking relevant documents most affected by the semantic gap.},

The key to ICF lies in the estimation of item similarities. Observing the block-diagonal structure of the item similarities in practice, we propose a block-diagonal regularization (BDR) over item similarities for ICF. The intuitions behind BDR are as follows: (1) with BDR, item clustering is embedded into the learning of ICF methods; (2) BDR induces sparsity of item similarities, which guarantees recommendation efficiency; and (3) BDR captures in-block transitivity to overcome rating sparsity. By regularizing the item similarity matrix of item similarity models with BDR, we obtain a block-aware item similarity model. Our experimental evaluations on a large number of datasets show that the block-diagonal structure is crucial to the performance of top-N recommendation.},

abstract = {Online ranker evaluation is one of the key challenges in information retrieval. Although the preferences of rankers can be inferred by interleaving methods, the problem of how to effectively choose the ranker pair that generates the interleaved list without degrading the user experience too much is still challenging. On the one hand, if two rankers have not been compared enough, the inferred preference can be noisy and inaccurate. On the other hand, if two rankers are compared too many times, the interleaving process inevitably hurts the user experience too much. This dilemma is known as the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff. It is captured by the K-armed dueling bandit problem, which is a variant of the K-armed bandit problem, where the feedback comes in the form of pairwise preferences. Today’s deployed search systems can evaluate a large number of rankers concurrently, and scaling effectively in the presence of numerous rankers is a critical aspect of K-armed dueling bandit problems.In this article, we focus on solving the large-scale online ranker evaluation problem under the so-called Condorcet assumption, where there exists an optimal ranker that is preferred to all other rankers. We propose Merge Double Thompson Sampling (MergeDTS), which first utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy that localizes the comparisons carried out by the algorithm to small batches of rankers, and then employs Thompson Sampling to reduce the comparisons between suboptimal rankers inside these small batches. The effectiveness (regret) and efficiency (time complexity) of MergeDTS are extensively evaluated using examples from the domain of online evaluation for web search. Our main finding is that for large-scale Condorcet ranker evaluation problems, MergeDTS outperforms the state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms.},

This article is concerned with the problem of semantic location prediction of geotagged tweets. The underlying task is to associate to a social media post, the focal spatial object, if any (e.g., Place Of Interest POI), it topically focuses on. Although relevant for a number of applications such as POI recommendation, this problem has not so far received the attention it deserves. In previous work, the problem has mainly been tackled by means of language models that rely on costly probability estimation of word relevance across spatial regions. We propose the Spatially-aware Geotext Matching (SGM) model, which relies on a neural network learning framework. The model combines exact word-word-local interaction matching signals with semantic global tweet-POI interaction matching signals. The local interactions are built over kernel spatial word distributions that allow revealing spatially driven word pair similarity patterns. The global interactions consider the strength of the interaction between the tweet and the POI from both the spatial and semantic perspectives. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGM model compared to state-of-the-art baselines including language models and traditional neural interaction-based models.},

abstract = {Neural networks have been extensively used in recommender systems. Embedding layers are not only necessary but also crucial for neural models in recommendation as a typical discrete task. In this article, we argue that the widely used l2 regularization for normal neural layers (e.g., fully connected layers) is not ideal for embedding layers from the perspective of regularization theory in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. More specifically, the l2 regularization corresponds to the inner product and the distance in the Euclidean space where correlations between discrete objects (e.g., items) are not well captured. Inspired by this observation, we propose a graph-based regularization approach to serve as a counterpart of the l2 regularization for embedding layers. The proposed regularization incurs almost no extra computational overhead especially when being trained with mini-batches. We also discuss its relationships to other approaches (namely, data augmentation, graph convolution, and joint learning) theoretically. We conducted extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets from various domains with two state-of-the-art recommendation models. Results show that given a kNN (k-nearest neighbor) graph constructed directly from training data without external information, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the l2 regularization on all the datasets and achieves more notable improvements for long-tail users and items.},

abstract = {Real-world knowledge bases such as DBPedia, Yago, and Freebase contain sparse linkage connectivity, which poses a severe challenge to link prediction between entities. To cope with such data scarcity issues, recent models have focused on learning interactions between entity pairs by means of relations that exist between them. However promising, some relations are associated with very few tail entities or head entities, resulting in poor estimation of the relation interaction between entities. In this article, we break the sole dependency of modeling relation interactions between entity pairs by associating a triple with pairwise embeddings, i.e., distributed vector representations for pairs of word-based entities and relation of a triple. We capture the interactions that exist between pairwise embeddings by means of a Pairwise Factorization Model that employs a factorization machine with relation attention. This approach allows parameters for related interactions to be estimated efficiently, ensuring that the pairwise embeddings are discriminative, providing strong supervisory signals for the decoding task of link prediction. The Pairwise Factorization Model we propose exploits a neural bag-of-words model as the encoder, which effectively encodes word-based entities into distributed vector representations for the decoder. The proposed model is simple and enjoys efficiency and capability, showing superior link prediction performance over state-of-the-art complex models on benchmark datasets DBPedia50K and FB15K-237.},

abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing personalized services for users in the context of information overload. Generally, users’ feedback toward items often contain the most significant information reflecting their preferences, which enables accurate personalized recommendation. In real applications, users’ feedback are usually heterogeneous (rather than homogeneous) such as purchases and examinations in e-commerce, which reflects users’ preferences in different degrees. Effective modeling of such heterogeneous one-class feedback is challenging compared with that of homogeneous feedback of ratings. As a response, heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) is proposed, which often converts the heterogeneous feedback into two parts (i.e., target feedback and auxiliary feedback), aiming to care more about the target feedback (e.g., purchases) with the assistance of the auxiliary feedback (e.g., examinations). In this survey, we provide an overview of the representative HOCCF methods from the perspective of factorization-based methods, transfer learning-based methods, and deep learning-based methods. First, we review the factorization-based methods according to different strategies. Second, we describe the transfer learning-based methods with different knowledge sharing manners. Third, we discuss the deep learning-based methods according to the neural architectures. Moreover, we include some important example applications, describe the empirical studies, and discuss some promising future directions.},

Here we examine the newer asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) technique for entropy coding and develop mechanisms that allow it to be efficiently used when the size of the source alphabet is large—thousands or millions of symbols. In particular, we examine different ways in which probability distributions over large alphabets can be approximated and in doing so infer techniques that allow the ANS mechanism to be extended to support large-alphabet entropy coding. As well as providing a full description of ANS, we also present detailed experiments using several different types of input, including data streams arising as typical output from the modeling stages of text compression software, and compare theproposed ANS variants with Huffman and arithmetic coding baselines, measuring both compression effectiveness and also encoding and decoding throughput. We demonstrate that in applications in which semi-static compression is appropriate, ANS-based coders can provide an excellent balance between compression effectiveness and speed, even when the alphabet is large.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been attracting much attention from both academia and industry because of their ability to capture user interests and generate personalized item recommendations. As the life pace in contemporary society speeds up, traditional recommender systems are inevitably limited by their disconnected interaction styles and low adaptivity to users’ evolving demands. Consequently, conversational recommender systems emerge as a prospective research area, where an intelligent dialogue agent is integrated with a recommender system. Conversational recommender systems possess the ability to accurately understand end-users’ intent or request and generate human-like dialogue responses when performing recommendations. However, existing conversational recommender systems only allow the systems to ask users for more preference information, while users’ further questions and concerns about the recommended items (e.g., enquiring the location of a recommended restaurant) can hardly be addressed. Though the recent task-oriented dialogue systems allow for two-way communications, they are not easy to train because of their high dependence on human guidance in terms of user intent recognition and system response generation. Hence, to enable two-way human-machine communications and tackle the challenges brought by manually crafted rules, we propose Conversational Recommender System with Adversarial Learning (CRSAL), a novel end-to-end system to tackle the task of conversational recommendation. In CRSAL, we innovatively design a fully statistical dialogue state tracker coupled with a neural policy agent to precisely capture each user’s intent from limited dialogue data and generate conversational recommendation actions.

abstract = {The conversation task is usually formulated as a conditional generation problem, i.e., to generate a natural and meaningful response given the input utterance. Generally speaking, this formulation is apparently based on an oversimplified assumption that the response is solely dependent on the input utterance. It ignores the subjective factor of the responder, e.g., his/her emotion or knowledge state, which is a major factor that affects the response in practice. Without explicitly differentiating such subjective factor behind the response, existing generation models can only learn the general shape of conversations, leading to the blandness problem of the response. Moreover, there is no intervention mechanism within the existing generation process, since the response is fully decided by the input utterance. In this work, we propose to view the conversation task as a dual-factor generation problem, including an objective factor denoting the input utterance and a subjective factor denoting the responder state. We extend the existing neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model to accommodate the responder state modeling. We introduce two types of responder state, i.e., discrete and continuous state, to model emotion state and topic preference state, respectively. We show that with our dual-factor generation model, we can not only better fit the conversation data, but also actively control the generation of the response with respect to sentiment or topic specificity.},

abstract = {With the quick development of social websites, there are more opportunities to have different media types (such as text, image, video, etc.) describing the same topic from large-scale heterogeneous data sources. To efficiently identify the inter-media correlations for multimedia retrieval, unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has gained increased interest due to the significant reduction in computation and storage. However, most UCMH methods assume that the data from different modalities are well paired. As a result, existing UCMH methods may not achieve satisfactory performance when partially paired data are given only. In this article, we propose a new-type of UCMH method called robust unsupervised cross-modal hashing (RUCMH). The major contribution lies in jointly learning modal-specific hash function, exploring the correlations among modalities with partial or even without any pairwise correspondence, and preserving the information of original features as much as possible. The learning process can be modeled via a joint minimization problem, and the corresponding optimization algorithm is presented. A series of experiments is conducted on four real-world datasets (Wiki, MIRFlickr, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO). The results demonstrate that RUCMH can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods, especially for the partially paired case, which validates the effectiveness of RUCMH.},

Traditional approaches rely heavily on employers’ financial information, including financial reports and filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may not be readily available for private companies. Fortunately, online recruitment services provide a variety of employers’ information from their employees’ online ratings and comments, which enables EBE from an employee’s perspective. To this end, in this article, we propose a method named Company Profiling–based Collaborative Topic Regression (CPCTR) to collaboratively model both textual (i.e., reviews) and numerical information (i.e., salaries and ratings) for learning latent structural patterns of employer brands. With identified patterns, we can effectively conduct both qualitative opinion analysis and quantitative salary benchmarking. Moreover, a Gaussian processes--based extension, GPCTR, is proposed to capture the complex correlation among heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our methods in real-life applications. The results clearly show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines and enable a comprehensive understanding of EBE.},

abstract = {Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based recommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of interactions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the user’s recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender system mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions, which are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency relationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session information due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between different sessions is prevented. In this article, we solve these problems with the graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a graph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full Graph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency. To exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual session’s representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected Session (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout function to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e., Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.},

However, for the dynamic pruning techniques that underlie many commercial search engines, achieving accurate predictions of query latencies is difficult. We propose the use of index synopses—which are stochastic samples of the full index—for attaining accurate timing predictions. Indeed, we experiment using the TREC ClueWeb09 collection, and a large set of real user queries, and find that using small index synopses it is possible to very accurately estimate properties of the larger index, including sizes of posting list unions and intersections. Thereafter, we demonstrate that index synopses facilitate two key use cases: first, for query efficiency prediction, we show that predicting the query latencies on the full index and classifying long-running queries can be accurately achieved using index synopses; second, for query performance prediction, we show that the effectiveness of queries can be estimated more accurately using a synopsis index post-retrieval predictor than a pre-retrieval predictor. Overall, our experiments demonstrate the value of such a stochastic sample of a larger index at predicting the properties of the larger index.},

abstract = {Data lakes (DLs) are large repositories of raw datasets from disparate sources. As more datasets are ingested into a DL, there is an increasing need for efficient techniques to profile them and to detect the relationships among their schemata, commonly known as holistic schema matching. Schema matching detects similarity between the information stored in the datasets to support information discovery and retrieval. Currently, this is computationally expensive with the volume of state-of-the-art DLs. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early-pruning approach to improve efficiency, where we collect different types of content metadata and schema metadata about the datasets, and then use this metadata in early-pruning steps to pre-filter the schema matching comparisons. This involves computing proximities between datasets based on their metadata, discovering their relationships based on overall proximities and proposing similar dataset pairs for schema matching. We improve the effectiveness of this task by introducing a supervised mining approach for effectively detecting similar datasets that are proposed for further schema matching. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world DL that proves the success of our approach in effectively detecting similar datasets for schema matching, with recall rates of more than 85% and efficiency improvements above 70%. We empirically show the computational cost saving in space and time by applying our approach in comparison to instance-based schema matching techniques.},

abstract = {While continuous active learning algorithms have proven effective in finding most of the relevant documents in a collection, the cost for locating the last few remains high for applications such as Technology-assisted Reviews (TAR). To locate these last few but significant documents efficiently, Zou et&nbsp;al. [2018] have proposed a novel interactive algorithm. The algorithm is based on constructing questions about the presence or absence of entities in the missing relevant documents. The hypothesis made is that entities play a central role in documents carrying key information and that the users are able to answer questions about the presence or absence of an entity in the missing relevance documents. Based on this, a Sequential Bayesian Search-based approach that selects the optimal sequence of questions to ask was devised. In this work, we extend Zou et&nbsp;al. [2018] by (a) investigating the noise tolerance of the proposed algorithm; (b) proposing an alternative objective function to optimize, which accounts for user “erroneous” answers; (c) proposing a method that sequentially decides the best point to stop asking questions to the user; and (d) conducting a small user study to validate some of the assumptions made by Zou et&nbsp;al. [2018]. Furthermore, all experiments are extended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms not only in the phase of abstract appraisal (i.e., finding the abstracts of potentially relevant documents in a collection) but also finding the documents to be included in the review (i.e., finding the subset of those relevant abstracts for which the article remains relevant). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can greatly improve performance, requiring reviewing fewer irrelevant documents to find the last relevant ones compared to state-of-the-art methods, even in the case of noisy answers. Further, they show that our algorithm learns to stop asking questions at the right time. Last, we conduct a small user study involving an expert reviewer. The user study validates some of the assumptions made in this work regarding the user’s willingness to answer the system questions and the extent of it, as well as the ability of the user to answer these questions.},

abstract = {Network embedding which aims to learn the low-dimensional representations for vertices in networks has been extensively studied in recent years. Although there are various models designed for networks with different properties and different structures for different tasks, most of them are only applied to normal networks which only contain pairwise relationships between vertices. In many realistic cases, relationships among objects are not pairwise and such relationships can be better modeled by a hyper-network in which each edge can connect an uncertain number of vertices. In this article, we focus on two properties of hyper-networks: nonuniform and dual property. In order to make full use of these two properties, we firstly propose a flexible model called Hyper2vec to learn the embeddings of hyper-networks by applying a biased second order random walk strategy to hyper-networks in the framework of Skip-gram. Then, we combine the features of hyperedges by considering the dual hyper-networks to build a further model called NHNE based on 1D convolutional neural networks, and train a tuplewise similarity function for the nonuniform relationships in hyper-networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our methods for hyper-network embedding.},

A major challenge of fake news early detection is fully utilizing the limited data observed at the early stage of news propagation and then learning useful patterns from it for identifying fake news. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network to detect fake news early. It has three novel components: (1) a status-sensitive crowd response feature extractor that extracts both text features and user features from combinations of users’ text response and their corresponding user profiles, (2) a position-aware attention mechanism that highlights important user responses at specific ranking positions, and (3) a multi-region mean-pooling mechanism to perform feature aggregation based on multiple window sizes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with greater than 90% accuracy within 5 minutes after it starts to spread and before it is retweeted 50 times, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Most importantly, our approach requires only 10% labeled fake news samples to achieve this effectiveness under PU-Learning settings.},

abstract = {Contextual bandit problems are a natural fit for many information retrieval tasks, such as learning to rank, text classification, recommendation, and so on. However, existing learning methods for contextual bandit problems have one of two drawbacks: They either do not explore the space of all possible document rankings (i.e., actions) and, thus, may miss the optimal ranking, or they present suboptimal rankings to a user and, thus, may harm the user experience. We introduce a new learning method for contextual bandit problems, Safe Exploration Algorithm (SEA), which overcomes the above drawbacks. SEA starts by using a baseline (or production) ranking system (i.e., policy), which does not harm the user experience and, thus, is safe to execute but has suboptimal performance and, thus, needs to be improved. Then SEA uses counterfactual learning to learn a new policy based on the behavior of the baseline policy. SEA also uses high-confidence off-policy evaluation to estimate the performance of the newly learned policy. Once the performance of the newly learned policy is at least as good as the performance of the baseline policy, SEA starts using the new policy to execute new actions, allowing it to actively explore favorable regions of the action space. This way, SEA never performs worse than the baseline policy and, thus, does not harm the user experience, while still exploring the action space and, thus, being able to find an optimal policy. Our experiments using text classification and document retrieval confirm the above by comparing SEA (and a boundless variant called BSEA) to online and offline learning methods for contextual bandit problems.},

Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our results in the United States city of Chicago, Illinois, showing that they can help to improve the knowledge of subjective characteristics of different areas of the city. For instance, particular areas of the city tend to concentrate more images of a specific class of sentiment, which are also correlated with median income, opening up opportunities in different fields.},

Unlike traditional task-oriented bots, an open-domain dialog system aims to establish long-term connections with users by satisfying the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. This article reviews the recent work on neural approaches that are devoted to addressing three challenges in developing such systems: semantics, consistency, and interactiveness. Semantics requires a dialog system to not only understand the content of the dialog but also identify users’ emotional and social needs during the conversation. Consistency requires the system to demonstrate a consistent personality to win users’ trust and gain their long-term confidence. Interactiveness refers to the system’s ability to generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as entertainment and conforming. The studies we select to present in this survey are based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless, we hope that the discussion will inspire new research in developing more intelligent open-domain dialog systems.},

Instead of using text data, we aim to annotate microblog users with meaningful tags by leveraging rich social link data. To utilize directed social links, we use two kinds of node representations for modeling user interest in terms of their followers and followees, respectively. To alleviate the sparsity problem, we propose a novel method based on two transformation functions for capturing implicit interest similarity. Different from previous works on capturing high-order proximity, our model is able to directly characterize the effect of the context user on the proximity of node pairs. Another novelty of our model is that the importance scores of users learned from the classic PageRank algorithm are utilized to set the link weights. By using such weights, our model is more capable of disentangling the interest similarity evidence of a link. We jointly consider the above factors when designing the final objective function.We construct a very large evaluation set consisting of 2.6M users, 0.5M tags, and 0.8B following links. To our knowledge, it is the largest reported dataset for microblog user tagging in the literature. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We implement this approach with several optimization techniques, which makes our model easy to scale to very large social networks. Ubiquitous social links provide important data resources to understand user interests. Our work provides an effective and efficient solution to annotate user interests solely using the link data, which has important practical value in industry. To illustrate the use of our models, we implement a demonstration system for visualizing, navigating, and searching microblog users.},

In this study, we assume that public opinion on a social issue on Twitter carries a certain degree of emotion, and there is an emotion flow underneath the Twitter network. In this article, we investigate social dynamics of emotion present in users’ opinions and attempt to understand (i) changing characteristics of users’ emotions toward a social issue over time, (ii) influence of public emotions on individuals’ emotions, (iii) cause of changing opinion by social factors, and so on. We study users’ emotion dynamics over a collection of 17.65M tweets with 69.36K users and observe 63% of the users are likely to change their emotional state against the topic into their subsequent tweets. Tweets were coming from the member community shows higher influencing capability than the other community sources.

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a flourishing of community-driven question answering (cQA), like Yahoo! Answers and AnswerBag, where people can seek precise information. After 2010, some novel cQA systems, including Quora and Zhihu, gained momentum. Besides interactions, the latter enables users to label the questions with topic tags that highlight the key points conveyed in the questions. In this article, we shed light on automatically annotating a newly posted question with topic tags that are predefined and preorganized into a directed acyclic graph. To accomplish this task, we present an end-to-end deep interactive embedding model to jointly learn the embeddings of questions and topics by projecting them into the same space for a similarity measure. In particular, we first learn the embeddings of questions and topic tags by two deep parallel models. Thereinto, we regularize the embeddings of topic tags via fully exploring their hierarchical structures, which is able to alleviate the problem of imbalanced topic distribution. Thereafter, we interact each question embedding with the topic tag matrix, i.e., all the topic tag embeddings. Following that, a sigmoid cross-entropy loss is appended to reward the positive question-topic pairs and penalize the negative ones. To justify our model, we have conducted extensive experiments on an unprecedented large-scale social QA dataset obtained from Zhihu.com, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance to several state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {The rapid development of the technologies for online learning provides students with extensive resources for self-learning and brings new opportunities for data-driven research on educational management. An important issue of online learning is to diagnose the knowledge proficiency (i.e., the mastery level of a certain knowledge concept) of each student. Considering that it is a common case that students inevitably learn and forget knowledge from time to time, it is necessary to track the change of their knowledge proficiency during the learning process. Existing approaches either relied on static scenarios or ignored the interpretability of diagnosis results. To address these problems, in this article, we present a focused study on diagnosing the knowledge proficiency of students, where the goal is to track and explain their evolutions simultaneously. Specifically, we first devise an explanatory probabilistic matrix factorization model, Knowledge Proficiency Tracing (KPT), by leveraging educational priors. KPT model first associates each exercise with a knowledge vector in which each element represents a specific knowledge concept with the help of Q-matrix. Correspondingly, at each time, each student can be represented as a proficiency vector in the same knowledge space. Then, our KPT model jointly applies two classical educational theories (i.e., learning curve and forgetting curve) to capture the change of students’ proficiency level on concepts over time. Furthermore, for improving the predictive performance, we develop an improved version of KPT, named Exercise-correlated Knowledge Proficiency Tracing (EKPT), by considering the connectivity among exercises with the same knowledge concepts. Finally, we apply our KPT and EKPT models to three important diagnostic tasks, including knowledge estimation, score prediction, and diagnosis result visualization. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that both of our models could track the knowledge proficiency of students effectively and interpretatively.},

abstract = {The widespread use of online recruitment services has led to an information explosion in the job market. As a result, recruiters have to seek intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right candidates to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit usually focus on measuring the matching degree between talent qualification and job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts, which could be easily misguided by the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of human judgment. To that end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Topic-based Ability-aware Person-Job Fit Neural Network (TAPJFNN) framework, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labor and can provide better interpretability about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available in abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers’ experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, two hierarchical topic-based ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measure the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. In addition, we design a refinement strategy for Person-Job Fit prediction based on historical recruitment records. Furthermore, we introduce how to exploit our TAPJFNN framework for enabling two specific applications in talent recruitment: talent sourcing and job recommendation. Particularly, in the application of job recommendation, a novel training mechanism is designed for addressing the challenge of biased negative labels. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the TAPJFNN and its variants compared with several baselines.},

abstract = {The top-N recommendation problem has been studied extensively. Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms show promising results for the problem. They predict a user’s preferences by estimating similarities between a target and user-rated items. Top-N recommendation remains a challenging task in scenarios where there is a lack of preference history for new items. Feature-based Similarity Models (FSMs) address this particular problem by extending item-based collaborative filtering by estimating similarity functions of item features. The quality of the estimated similarity function determines the accuracy of the recommendation. However, existing FSMs only estimate global similarity functions; i.e., they estimate using preference information across all users. Moreover, the estimated similarity functions are linear; hence, they may fail to capture the complex structure underlying item features.In this article, we propose to improve FSMs by estimating local similarity functions, where each function is estimated for a subset of like-minded users. To capture global preference patterns, we extend the global similarity function from linear to nonlinear, based on the effectiveness of variational autoencoders. We propose a Bayesian generative model, called the Local Variational Feature-based Similarity Model, to encapsulate local and global similarity functions. We present a variational Expectation Minimization algorithm for efficient approximate inference. Extensive experiments on a large number of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

abstract = {Most existing recommender systems leverage the primary feedback only, despite the fact that users also generate a large amount of auxiliary feedback. These feedback usually indicate different user preferences when comparing to the primary feedback directly used to optimize the system performance. For example, in E-commerce sites, view data is easily accessible, which provides a valuable yet weaker signal than the primary feedback of purchase. In this work, we improve implicit feedback-based recommender systems (dubbed Implicit Recommender Systems) by integrating auxiliary view data into matrix factorization (MF). To exploit different preference levels, we propose both pointwise and pairwise models in terms of how to leverage users’ viewing behaviors. The latter model learns the pairwise ranking relations among purchased, viewed, and non-viewed interactions, being more effective and flexible than the former pointwise MF method. However, such a pairwise formulation poses a computational efficiency problem in learning the model. To address this problem, we design a new learning algorithm based on the element-wise Alternating Least Squares&nbsp;(eALS) learner. Notably, our designed algorithm can efficiently learn model parameters from the whole user-item matrix (including all missing data), with a rather low time complexity that is dependent on the observed data only. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art MF methods by 6.43%∼ 6.75%.

abstract = {Psychometric measures reflecting people’s knowledge, ability, attitudes, and personality traits are critical for many real-world applications, such as e-commerce, health care, and cybersecurity. However, traditional methods cannot collect and measure rich psychometric dimensions in a timely and unobtrusive manner. Consequently, despite their importance, psychometric dimensions have received limited attention from the natural language processing and information retrieval communities. In this article, we propose a deep learning architecture, PyNDA, to extract psychometric dimensions from user-generated texts. PyNDA contains a novel representation embedding, a demographic embedding, a structural equation model (SEM) encoder, and a multitask learning mechanism designed to work in unison to address the unique challenges associated with extracting rich, sophisticated, and user-centric psychometric dimensions. Our experiments on three real-world datasets encompassing 11 psychometric dimensions, including trust, anxiety, and literacy, show that PyNDA markedly outperforms traditional feature-based classifiers as well as the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Ablation analysis reveals that each component of PyNDA significantly contributes to its overall performance. Collectively, the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture for facilitating rich psychometric analysis. Our results have important implications for user-centric information extraction and retrieval systems looking to measure and incorporate psychometric dimensions.},

abstract = {The paper-reviewer recommendation task is of significant academic importance for conference chairs and journal editors. It aims to recommend appropriate experts in a discipline to comment on the quality of papers of others in that discipline. How to effectively and accurately recommend reviewers for the submitted papers is a meaningful and still tough task. Generally, the relationship between a paper and a reviewer often depends on the semantic expressions of them. Creating a more expressive representation can make the peer-review process more robust and less arbitrary. So the representations of a paper and a reviewer are very important for the paper-reviewer recommendation. Actually, a reviewer or a paper often belongs to multiple research fields, which increases difficulty in paper-reviewer recommendation. In this article, we propose a Multi-Label Classification method using a HIErarchical and transPArent Representation named Hiepar-MLC. First, we introduce HIErarchical and transPArent Representation (Hiepar) to express the semantic information of the reviewer and the paper. Hiepar is learned from a two-level bidirectional gated recurrent unit based network applying the attention mechanism. It is capable of capturing the two-level hierarchical information (word-sentence-document) and highlighting the elements in reviewers or papers to support the labels. This word-sentence-document information mirrors the hierarchical structure of a reviewer or a paper and captures the exact semantics of them. Then we transform the paper-reviewer recommendation problem into a multi-level classification issue, whose multiple research labels exactly guide the learning process. It is flexible in that we can select any multi-label classification method to solve the paper-reviewer recommendation problem. Further, we propose a simple multi-label-based reviewer assignment (MLBRA) strategy to select the appropriate reviewers. It is interesting in that we also explore the paper-reviewer recommendation in the coarse-grain granularity. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset consisting of the papers in the ACM Digital Library show that Hiepar-MLC achieves better label prediction performance than the existing representation alternatives. In addition, with the MLBRA strategy, we show the effectiveness and the feasibility of our transformation from paper-reviewer recommendation to multi-label classification.},

abstract = {Previous embedding methods for attributed networks aim at learning low-dimensional vector representations only for nodes but not for both nodes and attributes, resulting in the fact that node embeddings cannot be directly used to recover the correlations between nodes and attributes. However, capturing such correlations by embeddings is of great importance for many real-world applications, such as attribute inference and user profiling. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, many attributed networks evolve over time, with their nodes, links, and attributes changing from time to time. In this article, we study the problem of jointly learning low-dimensional representations of both nodes and attributes for static and dynamic attributed networks. To address this problem, we propose a Co-embedding model for Static Attributed Networks (CSAN), which jointly learns low-dimensional representations of both attributes and nodes in the same semantic space such that their affinities can be effectively captured and measured, and a Co-embedding model for Dynamic Attributed Networks (CDAN) to dynamically track low-dimensional representations of nodes and attributes over time. To obtain effective embeddings, both our co-embedding models, CSAN and CDAN, embed each node and attribute with means and variances of Gaussian distributions via variational auto-encoders. Our CDAN model formulates the dynamic changes of a dynamic attributed network by aggregating perturbation features from the nodes’ local neighborhoods as well as attributes’ associations such that the evolving patterns of the given network can be tracked. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed embedding models outperform state-of-the-art non-dynamic and dynamic embedding models.},

abstract = {Payments in online ad auctions are typically derived from click-through rates, so that advertisers do not pay for ineffective ads. But advertisers often care about more than just clicks. That is, for example, if they aim to raise brand awareness or visibility. There is thus an opportunity to devise a more effective ad pricing paradigm, in which ads are paid only if they are actually noticed. This article contributes a novel auction format based on a pay-per-attention (PPA) scheme. We show that the PPA auction inherits the desirable properties (strategy-proofness and efficiency) as its pay-per-impression and pay-per-click counterparts, and that it also compares favourably in terms of revenues. To make the PPA format feasible, we also contribute a scalable diagnostic technology to predict user attention to ads in sponsored search using raw mouse cursor coordinates only, regardless of the page content and structure. We use the user attention predictions in numerical simulations to evaluate the PPA auction scheme. Our results show that, in relevant economic settings, the PPA revenues would be strictly higher than the existing auction payment schemes.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems play a vital role to keep users engaged with personalized contents in modern online platforms. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized many research fields and there is a surge of interest in applying it for recommendation. However, existing studies have largely focused on exploring complex deep-learning architectures for recommendation task, while typically applying the negative sampling strategy for model learning. Despite effectiveness, we argue that these methods suffer from two important limitations: (1) the methods with complex network structures have a substantial number of parameters, and require expensive computations even with a sampling-based learning strategy; (2) the negative sampling strategy is not robust, making sampling-based methods difficult to achieve the optimal performance in practical applications.In this work, we propose to learn neural recommendation models from the whole training data without sampling. However, such a non-sampling strategy poses strong challenges to learning efficiency. To address this, we derive three new optimization methods through rigorous mathematical reasoning, which can efficiently learn model parameters from the whole data (including all missing data) with a rather low time complexity. Moreover, based on a simple Neural Matrix Factorization architecture, we present a general framework named ENMF, short for Efficient Neural Matrix Factorization. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets indicate that the proposed ENMF framework consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the Top-K recommendation task. Remarkably, ENMF also shows significant advantages in training efficiency, which makes it more applicable to real-world large-scale systems.},

We report on a laboratory study (N=32) that investigated the effects of task complexity on the types of information used by participants while searching. Participants completed tasks of four complexity levels and had access to four different types of information provided through a search-assistance tool referred to as the InfoBoxes (IB). The IB tool presented the following types of task-related information (info-types) on different tabs: (1) facts, (2) concepts, (3) opinions, and (4) insights. Facts (and opinions) were defined as objective (and subjective) statements relevant to the task. Concepts were defined as important ideas, principles, or entities related to the task. Insights were defined as tips or advice about the task. The study investigated six research questions that considered the effects of task complexity on: (RQ1) participants’ pre-/post-task perceptions about useful info-types; (RQ2) use of different info-types during the task; (RQ3) motivations for engaging with the IB; (RQ4) gains from using it; (RQ5) the search stage participants were in while engaging with the IB; and (RQ6) motivations for sometimes avoiding the IB.

Furthermore, we extend BIS via some factorization techniques and obtain an adaptive version, i.e., adaptive BIS (ABIS), in order to better fit the behavioral data. We also design a compound weighting function that leverages the complementarity between two well-known time-aware weighting functions.

This article proposes an emotional conversation generation model based on a Bayesian deep neural network that can generate replies with rich emotions, clear themes, and diverse sentences. The topic and emotional keywords of the replies are pregenerated by introducing commonsense knowledge in the model. The reply is divided into multiple clauses, and then a multidimensional generator based on the transformer mechanism proposed in this article is used to iteratively generate clauses from two dimensions: sentence granularity and sentence structure. Subjective and objective experiments prove that compared with existing models, the proposed model effectively improves the semantic logic and emotional accuracy of replies. This model also significantly enhances the diversity of replies, largely overcoming the shortcomings of traditional models that generate safe replies.},

abstract = {Recommender systems aim to capture user preferences and provide accurate recommendations to users accordingly. For each user, there usually exist others with similar preferences, and a collection of users may also have similar preferences with each other, thus forming a community. However, such communities may not necessarily be explicitly given, and the users inside the same communities may not know each other; they are formally defined and named Implicit Preference Communities (IPCs) in this article. By enriching user preferences with the information of other users in the communities, the performance of recommender systems can also be enhanced.Historical explicit ratings are a good resource to construct the IPCs of users but is usually sparse. Meanwhile, user preferences are easily affected by their social connections, which can be jointly used for IPC modeling with the ratings. However, this imposes two challenges for model design. First, the rating and social domains are heterogeneous; thus, it is challenging to coordinate social information and rating behaviors for a same learning task. Therefore, transfer learning is a good strategy for IPC modeling. Second, the communities are not explicitly labeled, and existing supervised learning approaches do not fit the requirement of IPC modeling. As co-clustering is an effective unsupervised learning approach for discovering block structures in high-dimensional data, it is a cornerstone for discovering the structure of IPCs.In this article, we propose a recommendation model with Implicit Preference Communities from user ratings and social connections. To tackle the unsupervised learning limitation, we design a Bayesian probabilistic graphical model to capture the IPC structure for recommendation. Meanwhile, following the spirit of transfer learning, both rating behaviors and social connections are introduced into the model by parameter sharing. Moreover, Gibbs sampling-based algorithms are proposed for parameter inferences of the models. Furthermore, to meet the need for online scenarios when the data arrive sequentially as a stream, a novel online sampling-based parameter inference algorithm for recommendation is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose and formally define the concept of IPC.},

abstract = {Product search is one of the most popular methods for customers to discover products online. Most existing studies on product search focus on developing effective retrieval models that rank items by their likelihood to be purchased. However, they ignore the problem that there is a gap between how systems and customers perceive the relevance of items. Without explanations, users may not understand why product search engines retrieve certain items for them, which consequentially leads to imperfect user experience and suboptimal system performance in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem by constructing explainable retrieval models for product search. Specifically, we propose to model the “search and purchase” behavior as a dynamic relation between users and items, and create a dynamic knowledge graph based on both the multi-relational product data and the context of the search session. Ranking is conducted based on the relationship between users and items in the latent space, and explanations are generated with logic inferences and entity soft matching on the knowledge graph. Empirical experiments show that our model, which we refer to as the Dynamic Relation Embedding Model (DREM), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and has the ability to produce reasonable explanations for search results.},

abstract = {“Unbiasedness,” which is an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations of products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations in online rating systems. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” historical distortions in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “debiasing operations” are our main objective. Using 42M real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios, which can be further explained by a well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. This motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the “first” model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modelling perspective, which perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects observed in experiments. Moreover, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings and characterizing relationships in ratings. It also contributes to better recommendations, wiser consumer purchase decisions, and deeper understanding of historical distortions in both honest rating and misbehaving rating settings.},

Diversity is especially important when POIs are recommended in the target users’ frequently visited areas, because users are likely to revisit such areas. In addition to the (POI) category diversity that is a popular diversification objective in recommendation domains, diversification of recommended POI locations is an interesting subject itself. Despite its importance, existing POI recommender studies generally focus on and evaluate prediction accuracy. In this article, geographical diversification&nbsp;(geo-diversification), a novel diversification concept that aims to increase recommendation coverage for a target users’ geographic areas of interest, is introduced, from which a method that improves geo-diversity as an addition to existing state-of-the-art POI recommenders is proposed. In experiments with the datasets from two real Location Based Social Networks&nbsp;(LSBNs), we first analyze the performance of four state-of-the-art POI recommenders from various evaluation perspectives including category diversity and geo-diversity that have not been examined previously. The proposed method consistently improves geo-diversity&nbsp;(CPR(geo)@20) by 5 to 12% when combined with four state-of-the-art POI recommenders with negligible prediction accuracy&nbsp;(Recall@20) loss and provides 6 to 18% geo-diversity improvement with tolerable prediction accuracy loss&nbsp;&nbsp;(up to 2.4%).},

While a growing line of research has focused on modeling reading preferences for news recommendation, they neglect the instability of reader consumption behaviors, i.e., consumption behaviors of readers may be influenced by other factors in addition to user interests, which degrades the recommendation effectiveness of existing methods. In this article, we propose a probabilistic generative model, BoRe, where user interests and crowd effects are used to adapt to the instability of reader consumption behaviors, and reading sequences are utilized to adapt user interests evolving over time. Further, the extreme sparsity problem in the domain of news severely hinders accurately modeling user interests and reading sequences, which discounts BoRe’s ability to adapt to the instability. Accordingly, we leverage domain-specific features to model user interests in the situation of extreme sparsity. Meanwhile, we consider groups of users instead of individuals to capture reading sequences. Besides, we study how to reduce the computation to allow online application. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of BoRe on real-world datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of BoRe, compared with the state-of-the-art competing methods.},

abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) has attracted more and more attention in the community of recommendation. Even though LRMA-based recommendation methods (including Global LRMA and Local LRMA) obtain promising results, they suffer from the complicated structure of the large-scale and sparse rating matrix, especially when the underlying system includes a large set of items with various types and a huge amount of users with diverse interests. Thus, they have to predefine the important parameters, such as the rank of the rating matrix and the number of submatrices. Moreover, most existing Local LRMA methods are usually designed in a two-phase separated framework and do not consider the missing mechanisms of rating matrix. In this article, a non-parametric unified Bayesian graphical model is proposed for Adaptive Local low-rank Matrix Approximation (ALoMA). ALoMA has ability to simultaneously identify rating submatrices, determine the optimal rank for each submatrix, and learn the submatrix-specific user/item latent factors. Meanwhile, the missing mechanism is adopted to characterize the whole rating matrix. These four parts are seamlessly integrated and enhance each other in a unified framework. Specifically, the user-item rating matrix is adaptively divided into proper number of submatrices in ALoMA by exploiting the Chinese Restaurant Process. For each submatrix, by considering both global/local structure information and missing mechanisms, the latent user/item factors are identified in an optimal latent space by adopting automatic relevance determination technique. We theoretically analyze the model’s generalization error bounds and give an approximation guarantee. Furthermore, an efficient Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is designed to infer the proposed model. A series of experiments have been conducted on six real-world datasets (Epinions, Douban, Dianping, Yelp, Movielens (10M), and Netflix). The results demonstrate that ALoMA outperforms the state-of-the-art LRMA-based methods and can easily provide interpretable recommendation results.},

We empirically show that for a few state-of-the-art query-model induction methods, retrieval performance can be significantly improved by constructing the query model from a subset of the relevant documents rather than from all of them. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new approach for relevance-feedback-based retrieval. The approach, derived from the risk minimization framework, is based on utilizing multiple query models induced from all subsets of the given relevant documents. Empirical evaluation shows that the approach posts performance that is statistically significantly better than that of applying the standard practice of utilizing a single query model induced from the relevant documents. While the average relative improvements are small to moderate, the robustness of the approach is substantially higher than that of a variety of reference comparison methods that address various challenges in using relevance feedback.},

Query variations covering the same information need represent one way in which different sources of information might arise. However, when implemented in the obvious manner, fusion over query variations is not cost-effective, at odds with the usual web-search requirement for strict per-query efficiency guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel solution to query fusion by splitting the computation into two parts: one phase that is carried out offline, to generate pre-computed centroid answers for queries addressing broadly similar information needs, and then a second online phase that uses the corresponding topic centroid to compute a result page for each query. To achieve this, we make use of score-based fusion algorithms whose costs can be amortized via the pre-processing step and that can then be efficiently combined during subsequent per-query re-ranking operations. Experimental results using the ClueWeb12B collection and the UQV100 query variations demonstrate that centroid-based approaches allow improved retrieval effectiveness at little or no loss in query throughput or latency and within reasonable pre-processing requirements. We additionally show that queries that do not match any of the pre-computed clusters can be accurately identified and efficiently processed in our proposed ranking pipeline.},

To address this problem, we propose two novel click models for mobile search: (1) Mobile Click Model (MCM), which models click necessity bias and examination satisfaction bias; (2) Viewport Time Click Model (VTCM), which further extends MCM by utilizing the viewport time. Extensive experiments on large-scale real mobile search logs show that: (1) MCM and VTCM outperform existing models in predicting users’ clicks and estimating result relevance; (2) MCM and VTCM can extract richer information, such as the click necessity of search results and the probability of user satisfaction, from mobile click logs; (3) By modeling the viewport time distributions of heterogeneous results, VTCM can bring a significant improvement over MCM in click prediction and relevance estimation tasks.

To break the bottleneck, this article presents a novel model architecture, APVA, which includes a verification mechanism to check the correctness of predicted relations. Specifically, APVA takes advantage of KB-based information to improve relation prediction but verifies the correctness of the predicted relation by means of simple negative sampling in a logistic regression framework. The APVA architecture offers a natural way to integrate an iterative training procedure, which we call turbo training. Accordingly, we introduce APVA-TURBO to perform question answering over knowledge bases. We demonstrate extensive experiments to show that APVA-TURBO outperforms existing approaches on question answering.},

In this article, we propose to utilize personalized latent behavior patterns learned from contextual features, e.g., time of day, day of week, and location category, to improve the effectiveness of the recommendations. Two variations of models are developed, including GPDM, which learns a fixed pattern distribution for all users; and PPDM, which learns personalized pattern distribution for each user. In both models, a soft-max function is applied to integrate the personalized Markov chain with the latent patterns, and a sequential Bayesian Personalized Ranking (S-BPR) is applied as the optimization criterion. Then, Expectation Maximization (EM) is in charge of finding optimized model parameters. Extensive experiments on three large-scale commonly adopted real-world LBSN data sets prove that the inclusion of location category and latent patterns helps to boost the performance of POI recommendations. Specifically, our models in general significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods for both next and next new POI recommendation tasks.

abstract = {As the core of recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) models the affinity between a user and an item from historical user-item interactions, such as clicks, purchases, and so on. Benefiting from the strong representation power, neural networks have recently revolutionized the recommendation research, setting up a new standard for CF. However, existing neural recommender models do not explicitly consider the correlations among embedding dimensions, making them less effective in modeling the interaction function between users and items. In this work, we emphasize on modeling the correlations among embedding dimensions in neural networks to pursue higher effectiveness for CF. We propose a novel and general neural collaborative filtering framework—namely, ConvNCF, which is featured with two designs: (1) applying outer product on user embedding and item embedding to explicitly model the pairwise correlations between embedding dimensions, and (2) employing convolutional neural network above the outer product to learn the high-order correlations among embedding dimensions. To justify our proposal, we present three instantiations of ConvNCF by using different inputs to represent a user and conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Extensive results verify the utility of modeling embedding dimension correlations with ConvNCF, which outperforms several competitive CF methods.},

Deep interaction modeling captures non-linear user-item interactions with a deep neural network using the feature representations generated by the deep feature learning process as input. J-NCF enables the deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling processes to optimize each other through joint training, which leads to improved recommendation performance. In addition, we design a new loss function for optimization that takes both implicit and explicit feedback, point-wise and pair-wise loss into account.Experiments on several real-world datasets show significant improvements of J-NCF over state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of up to 8.24% on the MovieLens 100K dataset, 10.81% on the MovieLens 1M dataset, and 10.21% on the Amazon Movies dataset in terms of HR@10. NDCG@10 improvements are 12.42%, 14.24%, and 15.06%, respectively. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the scalability and sensitivity of J-NCF.

To this end, we propose MAD, a novel memory-augmented dialogue management model that employs a memory controller and two additional memory structures (i.e., a slot-value memory and an external memory). The slot-value memory tracks the dialogue state by memorizing and updating the values of semantic slots (i.e., cuisine, price, and location), and the external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional recurrent neural networks by storing more context information. To update the dialogue state efficiently, we also propose slot-level attention on user utterances to extract specific semantic information for each slot. Experiments show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing baselines.},

Current methodologies mainly concentrate on text matching, link analysis, and user behavior models. However, users judge the relevance of search results directly from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), which provide valuable signals for reranking. In this article, we propose two different approaches to aggregate the visual, structure, as well as textual information sources of search results in relevance estimation. The first one is a late-fusion framework named Joint Relevance Estimation model (JRE). JRE estimates the relevance independently from screenshots, textual contents, and HTML source codes of search results and jointly makes the final decision through an inter-modality attention mechanism. The second one is an early-fusion framework named Tree-based Deep Neural Network (TreeNN), which embeds the texts and images into the HTML parse tree through a recursive process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, we construct a large-scale practical Search Result Relevance (SRR) dataset that consists of multiple information sources and relevance labels of over 60,000 search results. Experimental results show that the proposed two models achieve better performance than state-of-the-art ranking solutions as well as the original rankings of commercial search engines.},

abstract = {Cross-lingual Text Classification (CLC) consists of automatically classifying, according to a common set C of classes, documents each written in one of a set of languages L, and doing so more accurately than when “na\"{\i}vely” classifying each document via its corresponding language-specific classifier. To obtain an increase in the classification accuracy for a given language, the system thus needs to also leverage the training examples written in the other languages. We tackle “multilabel” CLC via funnelling, a new ensemble learning method that we propose here. Funnelling consists of generating a two-tier classification system where all documents, irrespective of language, are classified by the same (second-tier) classifier. For this classifier, all documents are represented in a common, language-independent feature space consisting of the posterior probabilities generated by first-tier, language-dependent classifiers. This allows the classification of all test documents, of any language, to benefit from the information present in all training documents, of any language. We present substantial experiments, run on publicly available multilingual text collections, in which funnelling is shown to significantly outperform a number of state-of-the-art baselines. All code and datasets (in vector form) are made publicly available.},

abstract = {Prior work has studied how different characteristics of individual users (e.g., personality traits and cognitive abilities) can impact search behaviors and outcomes. We report on a laboratory study (N = 32) that investigated the effects of three different cognitive abilities (perceptual speed, working memory, and inhibition) in the context of aggregated search. Aggregated search systems combine results from multiple heterogeneous sources (or verticals) in a unified presentation. Participants in our study interacted with two different aggregated search interfaces (a within-subjects design) that differed based on the extent to which the layout distinguished between results originating from different verticals. The interleaved interface merged results from different verticals in a fairly unconstrained fashion. Conversely, the blocked interface displayed results from the same vertical as a group, displayed each group of vertical results in the same region on the SERP for every query, and used a border around each group of vertical results to help distinguish among results from different sources. We investigated three research questions (RQ1--RQ3). Specifically, we investigated the effects of the interface condition and each cognitive ability on three types of outcomes: (RQ1) participants’ levels of workload, (RQ2) participants’ levels of user engagement, and (RQ3) participants’ search behaviors. Our results found different main and interaction effects. Perceptual speed and inhibition did not significantly affect participants’ workload and user engagement but significantly affected their search behaviors. Specifically, with the interleaved interface, participants with lower perceptual speed had more difficulty finding relevant results on the SERP, and participants with lower inhibitory attention control searched at a slower pace. Working memory did not have a strong effect on participants’ behaviors but had several significant effects on the levels of workload and user engagement reported by participants. Specifically, participants with lower working memory reported higher levels of workload and lower levels of user engagement. We discuss implications of our results for designing aggregated search interfaces that are well suited for users with different cognitive abilities.},

However, there is no thorough investigation of how diversity affects user satisfaction in image search. In this article, we address the following questions: (1) How do different factors, such as content and visual presentations, affect users’ perception of diversity? (2) How does search result diversity affect user satisfaction with different search intents? To answer those questions, we conduct a set of laboratory user studies to collect users’ perceived diversity annotations and search satisfaction. We find that the existence of nearly duplicated image results has the largest impact on users’ perceived diversity, followed by the similarity in content and visual presentations. Besides these findings, we also investigate the relationship between diversity and satisfaction in image search. Specifically, we find that users’ preference for diversity varies across different search intents. When users want to collect information or save images for further usage (the Locate search tasks), more diversified result lists lead to higher satisfaction levels. The insights may help commercial image search engines to design better result ranking strategies and evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Item-based Collaborative Filtering (ICF) has been widely adopted in recommender systems in industry, owing to its strength in user interest modeling and ease in online personalization. By constructing a user’s profile with the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items that are similar to the user’s profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in recent years, significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item similarity (or representation) from data. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing works have only considered linear and shallow relationships between items, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making process of users.In this article, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the nonlinear and higher-order relationships among items. Going beyond modeling only the second-order interaction (e.g., similarity) between two items, we additionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by using nonlinear neural networks. By doing this, we can effectively model the higher-order relationship among items, capturing more complicated effects in user decision-making. For example, it can differentiate which historical itemsets in a user’s profile are more important in affecting the user to make a purchase decision on an item. We treat this solution as a deep variant of ICF, thus term it as DeepICF. To justify our proposal, we perform empirical studies on two public datasets from MovieLens and Pinterest. Extensive experiments verify the highly positive effect of higher-order item interaction modeling with nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that by more fine-grained second-order interaction modeling with attention network, the performance of our DeepICF method can be further improved.},

abstract = {Image search engines differ significantly from general web search engines in the way of presenting search results. The difference leads to different interaction and examination behavior patterns, and therefore requires changes in evaluation methodologies. However, evaluation of image search still utilizes the methods for general web search. In particular, offline metrics are calculated based on coarse-fine topical relevance judgments with the assumption that users examine results in a sequential manner.In this article, we investigate annotation methods via crowdsourcing for image search evaluation based on a lab-based user study. Using user satisfaction as the golden standard, we make several interesting findings. First, instead of item-based annotation, annotating relevance in a row-based way is more efficient without hurting performance. Second, besides topical relevance, image quality plays a crucial role when evaluating the image search results, and the importance of image quality changes with search intent. Third, compared to traditional four-level scales, the fine-grain annotation method outperforms significantly. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to systematically study how diverse factors in data annotation impact image search evaluation. Our results suggest different strategies for exploiting the crowdsourcing to get data annotated under different conditions.},

abstract = {In recent years, many studies extract aspects from user reviews and integrate them with ratings for improving the recommendation performance. The common aspects mentioned in a user’s reviews and a product’s reviews indicate indirect connections between the user and product. However, these aspect-based methods suffer from two problems. First, the common aspects are usually very sparse, which is caused by the sparsity of user-product interactions and the diversity of individual users’ vocabularies. Second, a user’s interests on aspects could be different with respect to different products, which are usually assumed to be static in existing methods. In this article, we propose an Attentive Aspect-based Recommendation Model (AARM) to tackle these challenges. For the first problem, to enrich the aspect connections between user and product, besides common aspects, AARM also models the interactions between synonymous and similar aspects. For the second problem, a neural attention network which simultaneously considers user, product, and aspect information is constructed to capture a user’s attention toward aspects when examining different products. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that AARM can effectively alleviate the two aforementioned problems and significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation methods on the top-N recommendation task.},

This is the case of shards, i.e., partitioning a document collection into sub-parts, which are used for many different purposes, ranging from efficiency to selective search or making test collection evaluation more accurate. In all these cases, there is empirical knowledge supporting the importance of shards, but we lack actual models that allow us to measure the impact of shards on system performance and how they interact with topics and systems. We use the general linear mixed model framework and present a model that encompasses the experimental factors of system, topic, shard, and their interaction effects. This detailed model allows us to more accurately estimate differences between the effect of various factors. We study shards created by a range of methods used in prior work and better explain observations noted in prior work in a principled setting and offer new insights. Notably, we discover that the topic*shard interaction effect, in particular, is a large effect almost globally across all datasets, an observation that, to our knowledge, has not been measured before.},

abstract = {To address the sparsity and cold-start problem of collaborative filtering, researchers usually make use of side information, such as social networks or item attributes, to improve the performance of recommendation. In this article, we consider the knowledge graph (KG) as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for KG-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the KG into recommender systems. RippleNet has two versions: (1) The outward propagation version, which is analogous to the actual ripples on water, stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user’s potential interests along links in the KG. The multiple “ripples” activated by a user’s historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item. (2) The inward aggregation version aggregates and incorporates the neighborhood information biasedly when computing the representation of a given entity. The neighborhood can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity and capture users’ long-distance interests. In addition, we intuitively demonstrate how a KG assists with recommender systems in RippleNet, and we also find that RippleNet provides a new perspective of explainability for the recommended results in terms of the KG. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that both versions of RippleNet achieve substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book, and news recommendations, over several state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Academic search engines have been widely used to access academic papers, where users’ information needs are explicitly represented as search queries. Some modern recommender systems have taken one step further by predicting users’ information needs without the presence of an explicit query. In this article, we examine an academic paper recommender that sends out paper recommendations in email newsletters, based on the users’ browsing history on the academic search engine. Specifically, we look at users who regularly browse papers on the search engine, and we sign up for the recommendation newsletters for the first time. We address the task of reranking the recommendation candidates that are generated by a production system for such users.We face the challenge that the users on whom we focus have not interacted with the recommender system before, which is a common scenario that every recommender system encounters when new users sign up. We propose an approach to reranking candidate recommendations that utilizes both paper content and user behavior. The approach is designed to suit the characteristics unique to our academic recommendation setting. For instance, content similarity measures can be used to find the closest match between candidate recommendations and the papers previously browsed by the user. To this end, we use a knowledge graph derived from paper metadata to compare entity similarities (papers, authors, and journals) in the embedding space. Since the users on whom we focus have no prior interactions with the recommender system, we propose a model to learn a mapping from users’ browsed articles to user clicks on the recommendations. We combine both content and behavior into a hybrid reranking model that outperforms the production baseline significantly, providing a relative 13% increase in Mean Average Precision and 28% in Precision@1.Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the model components, highlighting where the performance boost comes from. The obtained insights reveal useful components for the reranking process and can be generalized to other academic recommendation settings as well, such as the utility of graph embedding similarity. Also, recent papers browsed by users provide stronger evidence for recommendation than historical ones.},

abstract = {Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to help investors make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a promising choice for stock prediction.However, most existing deep learning solutions are not optimized toward the target of investment, i.e., selecting the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trends) or a regression problem (to predict stock prices). More importantly, they largely treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing solutions in two major aspects: (1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock ranking, and (2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.},

abstract = {In the field of sentiment analysis and emotion detection in social media, or other tasks such as text classification involving supervised learning, researchers rely more heavily on large and accurate labelled training datasets. However, obtaining large-scale labelled datasets is time-consuming and high-quality labelled datasets are expensive and scarce. To deal with these problems, online crowdsourcing systems provide us an efficient way to accelerate the process of collecting training data via distributing the enormous tasks to various annotators to help create large amounts of labelled data at an affordable cost. Nowadays, these crowdsourcing platforms are heavily needed in dealing with social media text, since the social network platforms (e.g., Twitter) generate huge amounts of data in textual form everyday. However, people from different social and knowledge backgrounds have different views on various texts, which may lead to noisy labels. The existing noisy label aggregation/refinement algorithms mostly focus on aggregating labels from noisy annotations, which would not guarantee their effectiveness on the subsequent classification/ranking tasks. In this article, we propose a noise-aware classification framework that integrates the steps of noisy label aggregation and classification. The aggregated noisy crowd labels are fed into a classifier for training, while the predicted labels are employed as feedback for adjusting the parameters at the label aggregating stage. The classification framework is suitable for directly running on crowdsourcing datasets and applies to various kinds of classification algorithms. The feedback strategy makes it possible for us to find optimal parameters instead of using known data for parameter selection. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method provide significant label aggregation performance for both binary and multiple classification tasks under various noisy environments. Experimenting on real-world data validates the feasibility of our framework in real noise data and helps us verify the reasonableness of the simulated experiment settings.},

abstract = {Learning to Rank (L2R) is one of the main research lines in Information Retrieval. Risk-sensitive L2R is a sub-area of L2R that tries to learn models that are good on average while at the same time reducing the risk of performing poorly in a few but important queries (e.g., medical or legal queries). One way of reducing risk in learned models is by selecting and removing noisy, redundant features, or features that promote some queries to the detriment of others. This is exacerbated by learning methods that usually maximize an average metric (e.g., mean average precision (MAP) or Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)). However, historically, feature selection (FS) methods have focused only on effectiveness and feature reduction as the main objectives. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to evaluate FS for L2R with an additional objective in mind, namely risk-sensitiveness. We present novel single and multi-objective criteria to optimize feature reduction, effectiveness, and risk-sensitiveness, all at the same time. We also introduce a new methodology to explore the search space, suggesting effective and efficient extensions of a well-known Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) for FS applied to L2R. Our experiments show that explicitly including risk as an objective criterion is crucial to achieving a more effective and risk-sensitive performance. We also provide a thorough analysis of our methodology and experimental results.},

Using a Gaussian Process classifier, and exploring its effectiveness on two datasets with very different characteristics and varying distributions of stances, we show that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baseline classifiers. Our classifier is especially effective in estimating the distribution of different types of stance associated with a given rumour, which we set forth as a desired characteristic for a rumour-tracking system that will show both ordinary users of Twitter and professional news practitioners how others orient to the disputed veracity of a rumour, with the final aim of establishing its actual truth value.},

abstract = {User interactions can be considered to constitute different feedback channels, for example, view, click, like or follow, that provide implicit information on users’ preferences. Each implicit feedback channel typically carries a unary, positive-only signal that can be exploited by collaborative filtering models to generate lists of personalized recommendations. This article investigates how a learning-to-rank recommender system can best take advantage of implicit feedback signals from multiple channels. We focus on Factorization Machines (FMs) with Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), a pairwise learning-to-rank method, that allows us to experiment with different forms of exploitation. We perform extensive experiments on three datasets with multiple types of feedback to arrive at a series of insights. We compare conventional, direct integration of feedback types with our proposed method, which exploits multiple feedback channels during the sampling process of training. We refer to our method as multi-channel sampling. Our results show that multi-channel sampling outperforms conventional integration, and that sampling with the relative “level” of feedback is always superior to a level-blind sampling approach. We evaluate our method experimentally on three datasets in different domains and observe that with our multi-channel sampler the accuracy of recommendations can be improved considerably compared to the state-of-the-art models. Further experiments reveal that the appropriate sampling method depends on particular properties of datasets such as popularity skewness.},

abstract = {Two fundamental problems concern the handling of large n-gram language models: indexing, that is, compressing the n-grams and associated satellite values without compromising their retrieval speed, and estimation, that is, computing the probability distribution of the n-grams extracted from a large textual source.Performing these two tasks efficiently is vital for several applications in the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, such as auto-completion in search engines and machine translation.Regarding the problem of indexing, we describe compressed, exact, and lossless data structures that simultaneously achieve high space reductions and no time degradation with respect to the state-of-the-art solutions and related software packages. In particular, we present a compressed trie data structure in which each word of an n-gram following a context of fixed length k, that is, its preceding k words, is encoded as an integer whose value is proportional to the number of words that follow such context. Since the number of words following a given context is typically very small in natural languages, we lower the space of representation to compression levels that were never achieved before, allowing the indexing of billions of strings. Despite the significant savings in space, our technique introduces a negligible penalty at query time.Specifically, the most space-efficient competitors in the literature, which are both quantized and lossy, do not take less than our trie data structure and are up to 5 times slower. Conversely, our trie is as fast as the fastest competitor but also retains an advantage of up to 65% in absolute space.Regarding the problem of estimation, we present a novel algorithm for estimating modified Kneser-Ney language models that have emerged as the de-facto choice for language modeling in both academia and industry thanks to their relatively low perplexity performance. Estimating such models from large textual sources poses the challenge of devising algorithms that make a parsimonious use of the disk.The state-of-the-art algorithm uses three sorting steps in external memory: we show an improved construction that requires only one sorting step by exploiting the properties of the extracted n-gram strings. With an extensive experimental analysis performed on billions of n-grams, we show an average improvement of 4.5 times on the total runtime of the previous approach.},

abstract = {Facing lots of name mentions appearing on the web, entity linking is essential for many information processing applications. To improve linking accuracy, the relations between entities are usually considered in the linking process. This kind of method is called collective entity linking and can obtain high-quality results. There are two kinds of information helpful to reveal the relations between entities, i.e., contextual information and structural information of entities. Most traditional collective entity linking methods consider them separately. In fact, these two kinds of information represent entities from specific and diverse views and can enhance each other, respectively. Besides, if we look into each view closely, it can be separated into sub-views that are more meaningful. For this reason, this article proposes a multi-view–based collective entity linking algorithm, which combines several views of entities into an objective function for entity linking. The importance of each view can be valued and the linking results can be obtained along with resolving this objective function. Experimental results demonstrate that our linking algorithm can acquire higher accuracy than many state-of-the-art entity linking methods. Besides, since we simplify the entity's structure and change the entity linking to a sub-matrix searching problem, our algorithm also obtains high efficiency.},

abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode user preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is incapable of fully capturing users’ preferences, because users usually exhibit different preferences when interacting with different items. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data, respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In the review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the pair-based relevant features for the given user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only reivew-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, an interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on seven real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with the attention mechanism, we show that the pair-based relevant information (i.e., context-aware information) in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction for different user-item pairs.},

Time and location are the two most important contextual factors in the user’s decision-making for choosing a POI to visit. In this article, we focus on the spatiotemporal context-aware POI recommendation, which considers the joint effect of time and location for POI recommendation. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge graph embedding, we propose a spatiotemporal context-aware and translation-based recommender framework (STA) to model the third-order relationship among users, POIs, and spatiotemporal contexts for large-scale POI recommendation. Specifically, we embed both users and POIs into a “transition space” where spatiotemporal contexts (i.e., a <time, location=""> pair) are modeled as translation vectors operating on users and POIs. We further develop a series of strategies to exploit various correlation information to address the data sparsity and cold-start issues for new spatiotemporal contexts, new users, and new POIs. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our STA framework achieves the superior performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data sparsity, and effectiveness in handling the cold-start problem.},

abstract = {Sentence-based summarization aims at extracting concise summaries of collections of textual documents. Summaries consist of a worthwhile subset of document sentences. The most effective multilingual strategies rely on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and on frequent itemset mining, respectively. LSA-based summarizers pick the document sentences that cover the most important concepts. Concepts are modeled as combinations of single-document terms and are derived from a term-by-sentence matrix by exploiting Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Itemset-based summarizers pick the sentences that contain the largest number of frequent itemsets, which represent combinations of frequently co-occurring terms. The main drawbacks of existing approaches are (i)&nbsp;the inability of LSA to consider the correlation between combinations of multiple-document terms and the underlying concepts, (ii)&nbsp;the inherent redundancy of frequent itemsets because similar itemsets may be related to the same concept, and (iii)&nbsp;the inability of itemset-based summarizers to correlate itemsets with the underlying document concepts. To overcome the issues of both of the abovementioned algorithms, we propose a new summarization approach that exploits frequent itemsets to describe all of the latent concepts covered by the documents under analysis and LSA to reduce the potentially redundant set of itemsets to a compact set of uncorrelated concepts. The summarizer selects the sentences that cover the latent concepts with minimal redundancy. We tested the summarization algorithm on both multilingual and English-language benchmark document collections. The proposed approach performed significantly better than both itemset- and LSA-based summarizers, and better than most of the other state-of-the-art approaches.},

The associated challenges include ambiguity of browses, scarcity of purchases, and heterogeneity arising from different feedback. In this article, we propose to model purchases and browses from a new perspective, i.e., users’ roles of mixer, browser and purchaser. Specifically, we design a novel transfer learning solution termed role-based transfer to rank (RoToR), which contains two variants, i.e., integrative RoToR and sequential RoToR. In integrative RoToR, we leverage browses into the preference learning task of purchases, in which we take each user as a sophisticated customer (i.e., mixer) that is able to take different types of feedback into consideration. In sequential RoToR, we aim to simplify the integrative one by decomposing it into two dependent phases according to a typical shopping process. Furthermore, we instantiate both variants using different preference learning paradigms such as pointwise preference learning and pairwise preference learning. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical studies with various baseline methods on three large public datasets and find that our RoToR can perform significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {E-commerce users may expect different products even for the same query, due to their diverse personal preferences. It is well known that there are two types of preferences: long-term ones and short-term ones. The former refers to users’ inherent purchasing bias and evolves slowly. By contrast, the latter reflects users’ purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both affect users’ current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To this end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed as ALSTP, for personalized product search. Our model adopts the neural networks approach to learn and integrate the long- and short-term user preferences with the current query for the personalized product search. In particular, two attention networks are designed to distinguish which factors in the short-term as well as long-term user preferences are more relevant to the current query. This unique design enables our model to capture users’ current search intentions more accurately. Our work is the first to apply attention mechanisms to integrate both long- and short-term user preferences with the given query for the personalized search. Extensive experiments over four Amazon product datasets show that our model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art product search methods in terms of different evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Personalized rating prediction is an important research problem in recommender systems. Although the latent factor model (e.g., matrix factorization) achieves good accuracy in rating prediction, it suffers from many problems including cold-start, non-transparency, and suboptimal results for individual user-item pairs. In this article, we exploit textual reviews and item images together with ratings to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we first apply a proposed multi-modal aspect-aware topic model (MATM) on text reviews and item images to model users’ preferences and items’ features from different aspects, and also estimate the aspect importance of a user toward an item. Then, the aspect importance is integrated into a novel aspect-aware latent factor model (ALFM), which learns user’s and item’s latent factors based on ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weight matrix to associate those latent factors with the same set of aspects in MATM, such that the latent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally, the overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings, which are weighted by the corresponding aspect importance. To this end, our model could alleviate the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability for recommendation. Besides, every aspect rating is weighted by its aspect importance, which is dependent on the targeted user’s preferences and the targeted item’s features. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method can model a user’s preferences on an item more accurately for each user-item pair. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on the Yelp 2017 Challenge dataset and Amazon product datasets. Results show that (1) our method achieves significant improvement compared to strong baseline methods, especially for users with only few ratings; (2) item visual features can improve the prediction performance—the effects of item image features on improving the prediction results depend on the importance of the visual features for the items; and (3) our model can explicitly interpret the predicted results in great detail.},

This explicitly recovers the venue context that is essential for applications such as location-based advertising or user profiling. For this geolocation task, we focus on geolocating tweets that are contained in tweet sequences. In a tweet sequence, tweets are posted from some latent venue(s) by the same user and within a short time interval. This scenario arises from two observations: (1) It is quite common that users post multiple tweets in a short time and (2) most tweets are not geocoded. To more accurately geolocate a tweet, we propose a model that performs query expansion on the tweet (query) using two novel approaches. The first approach temporal query expansion considers users’ staying behavior around venues. The second approach visitation query expansion leverages on user revisiting the same or similar venues in the past. We combine both query expansion approaches via a novel fusion framework and overlay them on a Hidden Markov Model to account for sequential information. In our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and metrics, we show our proposed model to be more robust and accurate than other baselines.},

Beyond the existing studies on developing algorithms for faceted search and empirical studies on facet usage, this study investigated user real-time interactions with facets over the course of a search from both data science and human factor perspectives. It adopted a Random Forest (RF) model to successfully predict facet use using search dynamic variables. In addition, the RF model provided a ranking of variables by their predictive power, which suggests that the search process follows rhythmic flow of a sequence within which facet addition is mostly influenced by its immediately preceding action. In the follow-up user study, we found that participants used facets at critical points from the beginning to end of search sessions. Participants used facets for distinctive reasons at different stages. They also used facets implicitly without applying the facets to their search. Most participants liked the faceted search, although a few participants were concerned about the choice overload introduced by facets. The results of this research can be used to understand information seekers and propose or refine a set of practical design guidelines for faceted search.},

abstract = {Integrating external knowledge into the recommendation system has attracted increasing attention in both industry and academic communities. Recent methods mostly take the power of neural network for effective knowledge representation to improve the recommendation performance. However, the heavy deep architectures in existing models are usually incorporated in an embedded manner, which may greatly increase the model complexity and lower the runtime efficiency.To simultaneously take the power of deep learning for external knowledge modeling as well as maintaining the model efficiency at test time, we reformulate the problem of recommendation with external knowledge into a generalized distillation framework. The general idea is to free the complex deep architecture into a separate model, which is only used in the training phrase, while abandoned at test time. In particular, in the training phrase, the external knowledge is processed by a comprehensive teacher model to produce valuable information to teach a simple and efficient student model. Once the framework is learned, the teacher model is abandoned, and only the succinct yet enhanced student model is used to make fast predictions at test time. In this article, we specify the external knowledge as user review, and to leverage it in an effective manner, we further extend the traditional generalized distillation framework by designing a Selective Distillation Network (SDNet) with adversarial adaption and orthogonality constraint strategies to make it more robust to noise information.Extensive experiments verify that our model can not only improve the performance of rating prediction, but also can significantly reduce time consumption when making predictions as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

Recent research illustrates that tensor models offer effective approaches for complex multi-relational data learning and missing element completion. So far, most tensor-based user clustering models have focused on the accuracy of recommendation. Given the dynamic nature of online media, recommendation in this setting is more challenging as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings as well as to identify unseen items as candidates of recommendation. Targeting at constructing a recommender system that can encourage more creativity, a deep Bayesian probabilistic tensor framework for tag and item recommendation is proposed. During the score ranking processes, a metric called Bayesian surprise is incorporated to increase the creativity of the recommended candidates. The new algorithm, called Deep Canonical PARAFAC Factorization (DCPF), is evaluated on both synthetic and large-scale real-world problems. An empirical study for video recommendation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model and indicates that it can better capture the latent patterns of interactions and generates interesting recommendations based on creative tag combinations.},

Snippets returned as search results also provide a context for the query that makes it easier to disambiguate the meaning of the query. From the search results, SMAPH builds a set of candidate entities with high coverage. This set is filtered by linking back the candidate entities to the terms occurring in the input query, ensuring high precision. A greedy disambiguation algorithm performs this filtering; it maximizes the coherence of the solution by iteratively discovering the pertinent entities mentioned in the query. We propose three versions of SMAPH that outperform state-of-the-art solutions on the known benchmarks and on the GERDAQ dataset, a novel dataset that we have built specifically for this problem via crowd-sourcing and that we make publicly available.},

abstract = {One important necessity is to filter out the irrelevant information and organize the relevant information into meaningful categories. However, developing text classifiers often requires a large number of labeled documents as training examples. Manually labeling documents is costly and time-consuming. More importantly, it becomes unrealistic to know all the categories covered by the documents beforehand. Recently, a few methods have been proposed to label documents by using a small set of relevant keywords for each category, known as dataless text classification. In this article, we propose a seed-guided topic model for the dataless text filtering and classification (named DFC). Given a collection of unlabeled documents, and for each specified category a small set of seed words that are relevant to the semantic meaning of the category, DFC filters out the irrelevant documents and classifies the relevant documents into the corresponding categories through topic influence. DFC models two kinds of topics: category-topics and general-topics. Also, there are two kinds of category-topics: relevant-topics and irrelevant-topics. Each relevant-topic is associated with one specific category, representing its semantic meaning. The irrelevant-topics represent the semantics of the unknown categories covered by the document collection. And the general-topics capture the global semantic information. DFC assumes that each document is associated with a single category-topic and a mixture of general-topics. A novelty of the model is that DFC learns the topics by exploiting the explicit word co-occurrence patterns between the seed words and regular words (i.e., non-seed words) in the document collection. A document is then filtered, or classified, based on its posterior category-topic assignment. Experiments on two widely used datasets show that DFC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art dataless text classifiers for both classification with filtering and classification without filtering. In many tasks, DFC can also achieve comparable or even better classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art supervised learning solutions. Our experimental results further show that DFC is insensitive to the tuning parameters. Moreover, we conduct a thorough study about the impact of seed words for existing dataless text classification techniques. The results reveal that it is not using more seed words but the document coverage of the seed words for the corresponding category that affects the dataless classification performance.},

abstract = {This article addresses the problem of matching the most similar data objects to a given query object. We adopt a generic model of similarity that involves the domain of objects and metric distance functions only. We examine the case of a large dataset in a complex data space, which makes this problem inherently difficult. Many indexing and searching approaches have been proposed, but they have often failed to efficiently prune complex search spaces and access large portions of the dataset when evaluating queries. We propose an approach to enhancing the existing search techniques to significantly reduce the number of accessed data objects while preserving the quality of the search results. In particular, we extend each data object with its sketch, a short binary string in Hamming space. These sketches approximate the similarity relationships in the original search space, and we use them to filter out non-relevant objects not pruned by the original search technique. We provide a&nbsp;probabilistic model to tune the parameters of the sketch-based filtering separately for each query object. Experiments conducted with different similarity search techniques and real-life datasets demonstrate that the secondary filtering can speed-up similarity search several times.},

It is publicly available on GitHub and its data format was submitted as RFC 7932 in July 2016. Brotli is based on the Lempel-Ziv compression scheme and planned as a generic replacement of Gzip and ZLib. The main goal in its design was to compress data on the Internet, which meant optimizing the resources used at decoding time, while achieving maximal compression density.This article is intended to provide the first thorough, systematic description of the Brotli format as well as a detailed computational and experimental analysis of the main algorithmic blocks underlying the current encoder implementation, together with a comparison against compressors of different families constituting the state-of-the-art either in practice or in theory. This treatment will allow us to raise a set of new algorithmic and software engineering problems that deserve further attention from the scientific community.},

abstract = {Discovery is an important aspect of the civil litigation process in the United States of America, in which all parties to a lawsuit are permitted to request relevant evidence from other parties. With the rapid growth of digital content, the emerging need for “e-discovery” has created a strong demand for techniques that can be used to review massive collections both for “responsiveness” (i.e., relevance) to the request and for “privilege” (i.e., presence of legally protected content that the party performing the review may have a right to withhold). In this process, the party performing the review may incur costs of two types, namely, annotation costs (deriving from the fact that human reviewers need to be paid for their work) and misclassification costs (deriving from the fact that failing to correctly determine the responsiveness or privilege of a document may adversely affect the interests of the parties in various ways). Relying exclusively on automatic classification would minimize annotation costs but could result in substantial misclassification costs, while relying exclusively on manual classification could generate the opposite consequences. This article proposes a risk minimization framework (called MINECORE, for “<underline>min</underline>imizing the <underline>e</underline>xpected <underline>co</underline>sts of <underline>re</underline>view”) that seeks to strike an optimal balance between these two extreme stands. In MINECORE (a) the documents are first automatically classified for both responsiveness and privilege, and then (b) some of the automatically classified documents are annotated by human reviewers for responsiveness (typically by junior reviewers) and/or, in cascade, for privilege (typically by senior reviewers), with the overall goal of minimizing the expected cost (i.e., the risk) of the entire process. Risk minimization is achieved by optimizing, for both responsiveness and privilege, the choice of which documents to manually review. We present a simulation study in which classes from a standard text classification test collection (RCV1-v2) are used as surrogates for responsiveness and privilege. The results indicate that MINECORE can yield substantially lower total cost than any of a set of strong baselines.},

abstract = {In this article, we extensively study the use of syntactic and semantic structures obtained with shallow and full syntactic parsers for answer passage reranking. We propose several dependency and constituent-based structures, also enriched with Linked Open Data (LD) knowledge to represent pairs of questions and answer passages. We encode such tree structures in learning-to-rank (L2R) algorithms using tree kernels, which can project them in tree substructure spaces, where each dimension represents a powerful syntactic/semantic feature. Additionally, since we define links between question and passage structures, our tree kernel spaces also include relational structural features. We carried out an extensive comparative experimentation of our models for automatic answer selection benchmarks on different TREC QA corpora as well as the newer Wikipedia-based dataset, namely WikiQA, which has been widely used to test sentence rerankers. The results consistently demonstrate that our structural semantic models achieve the state of the art in passage reranking. In particular, we derived the following important findings: (i) relational syntactic structures are essential to achieve superior results; (ii) models trained with dependency trees can outperform those trained with shallow trees, e.g., in case of sentence reranking; (iii) external knowledge automatically generated with focus and question classifiers is very effective; and (iv) the semantic information derived by LD and incorporated in syntactic structures can be used to replace the knowledge provided by the above-mentioned classifiers. This is a remarkable advantage as it enables our models to increase coverage and portability over new domains.},

abstract = {Understanding unstructured texts is an essential skill for human beings as it enables knowledge acquisition. Although understanding unstructured texts is easy for we human beings with good education, it is a great challenge for machines. Recently, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques, researchers put efforts to teach machines to understand texts and justify the educated machines by letting them solve the questions upon the given unstructured texts, inspired by the reading comprehension test as we humans do. However, feature effectiveness with respect to different questions significantly hinders the performance of answer selection, because different questions may focus on various aspects of the given text and answer candidates. To solve this problem, we propose a question-oriented feature attention (QFA) mechanism, which learns to weight different engineering features according to the given question, so that important features with respect to the specific question is emphasized accordingly. Experiments on MCTest dataset have well-validated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, the proposed QFA is applicable to various IR tasks, such as question answering and answer selection. We have verified the applicability on a crawled community-based question-answering dataset.},

abstract = {User response prediction is a crucial component for personalized information retrieval and filtering scenarios, such as recommender system and web search. The data in user response prediction is mostly in a multi-field categorical format and transformed into sparse representations via one-hot encoding. Due to the sparsity problems in representation and optimization, most research focuses on feature engineering and shallow modeling. Recently, deep neural networks have attracted research attention on such a problem for their high capacity and end-to-end training scheme. In this article, we study user response prediction in the scenario of click prediction. We first analyze a coupled gradient issue in latent vector-based models and propose kernel product to learn field-aware feature interactions. Then, we discuss an insensitive gradient issue in DNN-based models and propose Product-based Neural Network, which adopts a feature extractor to explore feature interactions. Generalizing the kernel product to a net-in-net architecture, we further propose Product-network in Network (PIN), which can generalize previous models. Extensive experiments on four industrial datasets and one contest dataset demonstrate that our models consistently outperform eight baselines on both area under curve and log loss. Besides, PIN makes great click-through rate improvement (relatively 34.67%) in online A/B test.},

abstract = {Modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems have become more and more complex, involving a large number of parameters. For example, a system may choose from a set of possible retrieval models (BM25, language model, etc.), or various query expansion parameters, whose values greatly influence the overall retrieval effectiveness. Traditionally, these parameters are set at a system level based on training queries, and the same parameters are then used for different queries. We observe that it may not be easy to set all these parameters separately, since they can be dependent. In addition, a global setting for all queries may not best fit all individual queries with different characteristics. The parameters should be set according to these characteristics. In this article, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem by dealing with the entire system configurations (i.e., a set of parameters representing an IR system behaviour) instead of selecting a single parameter at a time. The selection of the best configuration is cast as a problem of ranking different possible configurations given a query. We apply learning-to-rank approaches for this task. We exploit both the query features and the system configuration features in the learning-to-rank method so that the selection of configuration is query dependent. The experiments we conducted on four TREC ad hoc collections show that this approach can significantly outperform the traditional method to tune system configuration globally (i.e., grid search) and leads to higher effectiveness than the top performing systems of the TREC tracks. We also perform an ablation analysis on the impact of different features on the model learning capability and show that query expansion features are among the most important for adaptive systems.},

These unique features make traditional recommendation approaches no longer satisfactory for task and worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. In this article, we propose a two-tier data representation scheme (defining a worker--category suitability score and a worker--task attractiveness score) to support personalized task and worker recommendations. We also extend two optimization methods, namely least mean square error and Bayesian personalized rank, to better fit the characteristics of task/worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. We then integrate the proposed representation scheme and the extended optimization methods along with the two adapted popular learning models, i.e., matrix factorization and kNN, and result in two lines of top-N recommendation algorithms for crowdsourcing systems: (1) Top-N-Tasks recommendation algorithms for discovering the top-N most suitable tasks for a given worker and (2) Top-N-Workers recommendation algorithms for identifying the top-N best workers for a task requester. An extensive experimental study is conducted that validates the effectiveness and efficiency of a broad spectrum of algorithms, accompanied by our analysis and the insights gained.},

We introduce interactive intent modeling, a technique that models a user’s evolving search intents and visualizes them as keywords for interaction. The user can provide feedback on the keywords, from which the system learns and visualizes an improved intent estimate and retrieves information. We report experiments comparing variants of a system implementing interactive intent modeling to a control system. Data comprising search logs, interaction logs, essay answers, and questionnaires indicate significant improvements in task performance, information retrieval performance over the session, information comprehension performance, and user experience. The improvements in retrieval effectiveness can be attributed to the intent modeling and the effect on users’ task performance, breadth of information comprehension, and user experience are shown to be dependent on a richer visualization. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining interactive modeling of search intentions with interactive visualization of the models that can benefit both directing the exploratory search process and making sense of the information space. Our findings can help design personalized systems that support exploratory information seeking and discovery of novel information.},

abstract = {Influence maximization (IM), which selects a set of k seed users (a.k.a., a seed set) to maximize the influence spread over a social network, is a fundamental problem in a wide range of applications. However, most existing IM algorithms are static and location-unaware. They fail to provide high-quality seed sets efficiently when the social network evolves rapidly and IM queries are location-aware. In this article, we first define two IM queries, namely Stream Influence Maximization (SIM) and Location-aware SIM (LSIM), to track influential users over social streams. Technically, SIM adopts the sliding window model and maintains a seed set with the maximum influence value collectively over the most recent social actions. LSIM further considers social actions are associated with geo-tags and identifies a seed set that maximizes the influence value in a query region over a location-aware social stream. Then, we propose the Sparse Influential Checkpoints (SIC) framework for efficient SIM query processing. SIC maintains a sequence of influential checkpoints over the sliding window and each checkpoint maintains a partial solution for SIM in an append-only substream of social actions. Theoretically, SIC keeps a logarithmic number of checkpoints w.r.t.&nbsp;the size of the sliding window and always returns an approximate solution from one of the checkpoint for the SIM query at any time. Furthermore, we propose the Location-based SIC (LSIC) framework and its improved version LSIC+, both of which process LSIM queries by integrating the SIC framework with a Quadtree spatial index. LSIC can provide approximate solutions for both ad hoc and continuous LSIM queries in real time, while LSIC+ further improves the solution quality of LSIC. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed frameworks against the state-of-the-art IM algorithms.},

While supporting the highly dynamic and interactive exploratory search is still challenging for the search system, we want to investigate which factors can make the exploratory search successful and satisfying from the user’s perspective. Previous research suggests that domain experts have different search strategies and are more successful in finding domain-specific information, but how the domain expertise level will influence users’ interaction and search outcomes in exploratory search, especially in different knowledge domains, is still unclear. In this work, via a carefully designed user study that involves 30 participants, we investigate the influence of domain expertise levels on the interaction and outcome of exploratory search in three different domains: environment, medicine, and politics. We record participants’ search behaviors, including their explicit feedback and eye fixation sequences, in a laboratory setting. With this dataset, we identify both domain-independent and domain-dependent effects on user behaviors and search outcomes. Our results extend existing research on the effect of domain expertise in search and suggest different strategies for exploiting domain expertise to support exploratory search in different knowledge domains.},

Our first factor, medium, considers whether the request is produced using text or voice. Our second factor, target, considers whether the request is intended for a search engine or a human intermediary (i.e., someone who will search on the user’s behalf). In particular, we study how these two factors influence the way people formulate requests in situations where the information need has a specific type of extra-topical dimension (i.e., a type of constraint that is independent from the information need’s topic). We focus on six extra-topical dimensions: (1) domain knowledge, (2) viewpoint, (3) experiential, (4) venue location, (5) source location, and (6) temporal. The extra-topical dimension was manipulated by giving participants carefully constructed search tasks. We analyzed a large number of information requests produced by study participants, and address three research questions. We study the effects of our two factors (medium and target) on (RQ1) participants’ perceptions about their own information requests, (RQ2) the different characteristics of their information requests (e.g., natural language structure, retrieval performance), and (RQ3) participants’ strategies for requesting information when the search task has a specific type of extra-topical dimension. Our results found that both factors influenced participants’ perceptions about their own information requests, the characteristics of participants’ requests, and the strategies adopted by participants to request information matching the extra-topical dimension. Our results have implications for future research on methods that can harness (rather than ignore) extra-topical query terms to retrieve relevant information.},

In the NVSM paradigm, we learn low-dimensional representations of words and documents from scratch using gradient descent and rank documents according to their similarity with query representations that are composed from word representations. We show that NVSM performs better at document ranking than existing latent semantic vector space methods. The addition of NVSM to a mixture of lexical language models and a state-of-the-art baseline vector space model yields a statistically significant increase in retrieval effectiveness. Consequently, NVSM adds a complementary relevance signal. Next to semantic matching, we find that NVSM performs well in cases where lexical matching is needed. NVSM learns a notion of term specificity directly from the document collection without feature engineering. We also show that NVSM learns regularities related to Luhn significance. Finally, we give advice on how to deploy NVSM in situations where model selection (e.g., cross-validation) is infeasible. We find that an unsupervised ensemble of multiple models trained with different hyperparameter values performs better than a single cross-validated model. Therefore, NVSM can safely be used for ranking documents without supervised relevance judgments.},

abstract = {Location extraction, also called “toponym extraction,” is a field covering geoparsing, extracting spatial representations from location mentions in text, and geotagging, assigning spatial coordinates to content items. This article evaluates five “best-of-class” location extraction algorithms. We develop a geoparsing algorithm using an OpenStreetMap database, and a geotagging algorithm using a language model constructed from social media tags and multiple gazetteers. Third-party work evaluated includes a DBpedia-based entity recognition and disambiguation approach, a named entity recognition and Geonames gazetteer approach, and a Google Geocoder API approach. We perform two quantitative benchmark evaluations, one geoparsing tweets and one geotagging Flickr posts, to compare all approaches. We also perform a qualitative evaluation recalling top N location mentions from tweets during major news events.

abstract = {When content consumers explicitly judge content positively, we consider them to be engaged. Unfortunately, explicit user evaluations are difficult to collect, as they require user effort. Therefore, we propose to use device interactions as implicit feedback to detect engagement.We assess the usefulness of swipe interactions on tablets for predicting engagement and make the comparison with using traditional features based on time spent.We gathered two unique datasets of more than 250,000 swipes, 100,000 unique article visits, and over 35,000 explicitly judged news articles by modifying two commonly used tablet apps of two newspapers. We tracked all device interactions of 407 experiment participants during one month of habitual news reading.We employed a behavioral metric as a proxy for engagement, because our analysis needed to be scalable to many users, and scanning behavior required us to allow users to indicate engagement quickly.We point out the importance of taking into account content ordering, report the most predictive features, zoom in on briefly read content and on the most frequently read articles.Our findings demonstrate that fine-grained tablet interactions are useful indicators of engagement for newsreaders on tablets. The best features successfully combine both time-based aspects and swipe interactions.},

abstract = {This article presents a framework for speedy video matching and retrieval through detection and measurement of visual similarity. The framework’s efficiency stems from its power to encode a given shot content into a compact fixed-length signature that helps in robust real-time matching. Separate scene and motion signatures are developed and fused together to fully represent and match respective video shots. Scene information is captured through the Statistical Dominant Color Profile (SDCP), while motion information is captured through a graph-based signature called the Dominant Color Graph Profile (DCGP). The SDCP is a fixed-length compact signature that statistically encodes the colors’ spatiotemporal patterns across video frames. The DCGP is a fixed-length signature that records and tracks the gray levels across subsampled video frames, where the graph structural properties are used to extract the signature values. Finally, the overall video signature is generated by fusing the individual scene and motion signatures. The signature-based aspect of the proposed framework is the key to its high matching speed (&gt; 2000 fps) compared to current techniques that rely on exhaustive processing. To maximize the benefit of the framework, compressed-domain videos are utilized as a case study following their wide availability. However, the framework avoids full video decompression and operates on tiny frames rather than full-size decompressed frames. Experiments on various standard and challenging dataset groups show the framework’s robust performance in terms of both retrieval and computational performance.},

abstract = {Sentence regression is a type of extractive summarization that achieves state-of-the-art performance and is commonly used in practical systems. The most challenging task within the sentence regression framework is to identify discriminative features to represent each sentence. In this article, we study the use of sentence relations, e.g., Contextual Sentence Relations (CSR), Title Sentence Relations (TSR), and Query Sentence Relations (QSR), so as to improve the performance of sentence regression. CSR, TSR, and QSR refer to the relations between a main body sentence and its local context, its document title, and a given query, respectively.We propose a deep neural network model, Sentence Relation-based Summarization (SRSum), that consists of five sub-models, PriorSum, CSRSum, TSRSum, QSRSum, and SFSum. PriorSum encodes the latent semantic meaning of a sentence using a bi-gram convolutional neural network. SFSum encodes the surface information of a sentence, e.g., sentence length, sentence position, and so on. CSRSum, TSRSum, and QSRSum are three sentence relation sub-models corresponding to CSR, TSR, and QSR, respectively. CSRSum evaluates the ability of each sentence to summarize its local contexts. Specifically, CSRSum applies a CSR-based word-level and sentence-level attention mechanism to simulate the context-aware reading of a human reader, where words and sentences that have anaphoric relations or local summarization abilities are easily remembered and paid attention to. TSRSum evaluates the semantic closeness of each sentence with respect to its title, which usually reflects the main ideas of a document. TSRSum applies a TSR-based attention mechanism to simulate people’s reading ability with the main idea (title) in mind. QSRSum evaluates the relevance of each sentence with given queries for the query-focused summarization. QSRSum applies a QSR-based attention mechanism to simulate the attentive reading of a human reader with some queries in mind. The mechanism can recognize which parts of the given queries are more likely answered by a sentence under consideration. Finally as a whole, SRSum automatically learns useful latent features by jointly learning representations of query sentences, content sentences, and title sentences as well as their relations.We conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including generic multi-document summarization and query-focused multi-document summarization. On both tasks, SRSum achieves comparable or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple ROUGE metrics.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of a search engine is typically evaluated using hand-labeled datasets, where the labels indicate the relevance of documents to queries. Often the number of labels needed is too large to be created by the best annotators, and so less expensive labels (e.g., from crowdsourcing) are used. This introduces errors in the labels, and thus errors in standard effectiveness metrics (such as P@k and DCG). These errors must be taken into consideration when using the metrics. Previous work has approached assessor error by taking aggregates over multiple inexpensive assessors. We take a different approach and introduce equations and algorithms that can adjust the metrics to the values they would have had if there were no annotation errors.This is especially important when two search engines are compared on their metrics. We give examples where one engine appeared to be statistically significantly better than the other, but the effect disappeared after the metrics were corrected for annotation error. In other words, the evidence supporting a statistical difference was illusory and caused by a failure to account for annotation error.},

An appropriate usage of quote usually equips the expression with more elegance and credibility. However, there are times when we are eager to stress our idea by citing a quote, while nothing relevant comes to mind. Therefore, it is exciting to have a recommender system which provides quote recommendations while we are writing. This article extends previous study of quote recommendation, the task that recommends the appropriate quote according to the context (i.e., the content occurring before and after the quote). In this article, a quote recommender system called QuoteRec is presented to tackle the task. We investigate two models to learn the vector representations of quotes and contexts, and then rank the candidate quotes based on the representations. The first model learns the quote representation according to the contexts of a quote. The second model is an extension of the neural network model in previous study, which learns the representation of a quote by concerning both its content and contexts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two models in learning the semantic representations of quotes, and the neural network model achieves state-of-the-art results on the quote recommendation task.},

abstract = {Location recommendation is an important means to help people discover attractive locations. However, extreme sparsity of user-location matrices leads to a severe challenge, so it is necessary to take implicit feedback characteristics of user mobility data into account and leverage the location’s spatial information. To this end, based on previously developed GeoMF, we propose a scalable and flexible framework, dubbed GeoMF++, for joint geographical modeling and implicit feedback-based matrix factorization. We then develop an efficient optimization algorithm for parameter learning, which scales linearly with data size and the total number of neighbor grids of all locations. GeoMF++ can be well explained from two perspectives. First, it subsumes two-dimensional kernel density estimation so that it captures spatial clustering phenomenon in user mobility data; Second, it is strongly connected with widely used neighbor additive models, graph Laplacian regularized models, and collective matrix factorization. Finally, we extensively evaluate GeoMF++ on two large-scale LBSN datasets. The experimental results show that GeoMF++ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art and other competing baselines on both datasets in terms of NDCG and Recall. Besides, the efficiency studies show that GeoMF++ is much more scalable with the increase of data size and the dimension of latent space.},

abstract = {Event-based social networks (EBSNs) are becoming popular in recent years. Users can publish a planned event on an EBSN website, calling for other users to participate in the event. When a user is making a decision on whether to participate in an event in EBSNs, one aspect for consideration is existing participants defined as users who have agreed to join this event. Existing participants of the event may affect the decision of the user, to which we refer as participant influence. However, participant influence is not well studied by previous works. In this article, we propose an event recommendation model that considers participant influence, and exploits the influence of existing participants on the decisions of new participants based on Poisson factorization. The effect of participant influence is associated with the target event, the host group of the event, and the location of the event. Furthermore, our proposed model can extract latent event topics from event text descriptions, and characterize events, groups, and locations by distributions of event topics. Associations between latent event topics and participant influence are exploited for improving event recommendation. Besides making event recommendation, the proposed model is able to reveal the semantic properties of the participant influence between two users semantically. We have conducted extensive experiments on some datasets extracted from a real-world EBSN. Our proposed model achieves superior event recommendation performance over several state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that the consideration of participant influence can improve event recommendation.},

abstract = {Online Judge (OJ) systems have been widely used in many areas, including programming, mathematical problems solving, and job interviews. Unlike other online learning systems, such as Massive Open Online Course, most OJ systems are designed for self-directed learning without the intervention of teachers. Also, in most OJ systems, problems are simply listed in volumes and there is no clear organization of them by topics or difficulty levels. As such, problems in the same volume are mixed in terms of topics or difficulty levels. By analyzing large-scale users’ learning traces, we observe that there are two major learning modes (or patterns). Users either practice problems in a sequential manner from the same volume regardless of their topics or they attempt problems about the same topic, which may spread across multiple volumes. Our observation is consistent with the findings in classic educational psychology. Based on our observation, we propose a novel two-mode Markov topic model to automatically detect the topics of online problems by jointly characterizing the two learning modes. For further predicting the difficulty level of online problems, we propose a competition-based expertise model using the learned topic information. Extensive experiments on three large OJ datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in three different tasks, including skill topic extraction, expertise competition prediction and problem recommendation.},

We introduce a comprehensive analysis of the presentation of such clusters from seven different verticals based on the logs of a commercial Web search engine. This analysis reveals several unique characteristics—such as size, rank, and clicks—of result clusters from community question-and-answer websites. The study of properties of this result cluster—specifically as part of the SERP—has received little attention in previous work. Our analysis also motivates the pursuit of a long-standing challenge in ad hoc retrieval, namely, selective cluster retrieval. In our setting, the specific challenge is to select for presentation the documents most highly ranked either by a cluster-based approach (those in the top-retrieved cluster) or by a document-based approach. We address this classification task by representing queries with features based on those utilized for ranking the clusters, query-performance predictors, and properties of the document-clustering structure. Empirical evaluation performed with TREC data shows that our approach outperforms a recently proposed state-of-the-art cluster-based document-retrieval method as well as state-of-the-art document-retrieval methods that do not account for inter-document similarities.},

Temporal summarization (TS) approaches are used to automatically produce concise overviews of such events by extracting text snippets from related articles over time. Current TS approaches rely on a combination of event relevance and textual novelty for snippet selection. However, for events that span multiple days, textual novelty is often a poor criterion for selecting snippets, since many snippets are textually unique but are semantically redundant or non-informative. In this article, we propose a framework for the diversification of snippets using explicit event aspects, building on recent works in search result diversification. In particular, we first propose two techniques to identify explicit aspects that a user might want to see covered in a summary for different types of event. We then extend a state-of-the-art explicit diversification framework to maximize the coverage of these aspects when selecting summary snippets for unseen events. Through experimentation over the TREC TS 2013, 2014, and 2015 datasets, we show that explicit diversification for temporal summarization significantly outperforms classical novelty-based diversification, as the use of explicit event aspects reduces the amount of redundant and off-topic snippets returned, while also increasing summary timeliness.},

This recovers the venue context and differs from prior work, which geolocats tweets to location coordinates or cities/neighborhoods.First, we conduct empirical analysis to uncover venue and user characteristics for improving geolocation. For venues, we observe spatial homophily, in which venues near each other have more similar tweet content (i.e., text representations) compared to venues further apart. For users, we observe that they are spatially focused and more likely to visit venues near their previous visits. We also find that a substantial proportion of users post one or more geocoded tweet(s), thus providing their location history data. We then propose geolocation models that exploit spatial homophily and spatial focus characteristics plus posting time information. Our models rank candidate venues of test tweets such that the actual posting venue is ranked high. To better tune model parameters, we introduce a learning-to-rank framework. Our best model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that tweets without any location-indicative words can be geolocated meaningfully as well.},

abstract = {The spatial keyword query takes as inputs a query location and a set of query keywords and returns the answer objects by considering both their spatial distances to the query location and textual similarity with the query keywords. However, temporal information plays an important role in the spatial keyword query (where there is, to our knowledge, no prior work considering temporal information of the objects), since objects are not always valid. For instance, visitors may plan their trips according to the opening hours of attractions. Moreover, in real-life applications, objects are located on a predefined road network, and the spatial proximity of two objects is measured by the shortest path distance or travelling time between them. In this article, we study the problem of time-aware spatial keyword (TSK) query, which assumes that objects are located on the road network, and finds the k objects satisfying users’ spatio-temporal description and textual constraint. We first present the pruning strategy and algorithm based on an existing index. Then, we design an efficient index structure called TG index and propose several algorithms using the TG index that can prune the search space with both spatio-temporal and textual information simultaneously. Further, we show that the TG index technique can also be applied to improve the performance of time-travel text search and spatial keyword query. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented index and algorithms.},

abstract = {Recommending venues or points-of-interest (POIs) is a hot topic in recent years, especially for tourism applications and mobile users. We propose and evaluate several suggestion methods, taking an effectiveness, feasibility, efficiency, and privacy perspective. The task is addressed by two content-based methods (a Weighted kNN classifier and a Rated Rocchio personalized query), Collaborative Filtering methods, as well as several (rank-based or rating-based) methods of merging results of different systems. Effectiveness is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets, provided and used by TREC’s Contextual Suggestion Tracks in 2015 and 2016. First, we enrich these datasets with more information on venues, collected from web services like Foursquare and Yelp; we make this extra data available for future experimentation. Then, we find that the content-based methods provide state-of-the-art effectiveness, the collaborative filtering variants mostly suffer from data sparsity problems in the current datasets, and the merging methods further improve results by mainly promoting the first relevant suggestion. Concerning mobile feasibility, efficiency, and user privacy, the content-based methods, especially Rated Rocchio, are the best. Collaborative filtering has the worst efficiency and privacy leaks. Our findings can be very useful for developing effective and efficient operational systems, respecting user privacy. Last, our experiments indicate that better benchmark datasets would be welcome, and the use of additional evaluation measures—more sensitive in recall—is recommended.},

abstract = {Sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of user generated sentiment data (e.g., reviews, blogs). In real applications, these user-generated sentiment data can span so many different domains that it is difficult to label the training data for all of them. Therefore, we study the problem of sentiment classification adaptation task in this article. That is, a system is trained to label reviews from one source domain but is meant to be used on the target domain. One of the biggest challenges for sentiment classification adaptation task is how to deal with the problem when two data distributions between the source domain and target domain are significantly different from one another. However, our observation is that there might exist some domain shared knowledge among certain input dimensions of different domains. In this article, we present a novel method for modeling and mining the domain shared knowledge from different sentiment review domains via a joint non-negative matrix factorization–based framework. In this proposed framework, we attempt to learn the domain shared knowledge and the domain-specific information from different sentiment review domains with several various regularization constraints. The advantage of the proposed method can promote the correspondence under the topic space between the source domain and the target domain, which can significantly reduce the data distribution gap across two domains. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world balanced data sets from Amazon product reviews for sentence-level and document-level binary sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms several strong baselines and achieves an accuracy that is competitive with the most well-known methods for sentiment classification adaptation.},

However, several fundamental problems deserve investigation to provide deep insight into active learning. In this article, we conduct an in-depth investigation on active learning for classification from the perspective of model change. We derive a general active learning framework for classification called maximum model change (MMC), which aims at querying the influential examples. The model change is quantified as the difference between the model parameters before and after training with the expanded training set. Inspired by the stochastic gradient update rule, the gradient of the loss with respect to a given candidate example is adopted to approximate the model change. This framework is applied to two popular classifiers: support vector machines and logistic regression. We analyze the convergence property of MMC and theoretically justify it. We explore the connection between MMC and uncertainty-based sampling to provide a uniform view. In addition, we discuss its potential usability to other learning models and show its applicability in a wide range of applications. We validate the MMC strategy on two kinds of benchmark datasets, the UCI repository and ImageNet, and show that it outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Facing a large amount of entities appearing on the web, entity linking has recently become useful. It assigns an entity from a resource to one name mention to help users grasp the meaning of this name mention. Unfortunately, many possible entities can be assigned to one name mention. Apparently, the usually co-occurring name mentions are related and can be considered together to determine their best assignments. This approach is called collective entity linking and is often conducted based on entity graph. However, traditional collective entity linking methods either consume much time due to the large scale of entity graph or obtain low accuracy due to simplifying graph. To improve both accuracy and efficiency, this article proposes a novel collective entity linking algorithm. It first constructs an entity graph by connecting any two related entities, and then a probability-based objective function is proposed on this graph to ensure the high accuracy of the linking result. Via this function, we convert entity linking to the process of finding the nodes with the highest PageRank Values. Greedy search and an adjusted Monte Carlo random walk are proposed to fulfill this work. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs much better than traditional linking methods.},

In this way, it approaches the problem of aggregating different crowd assessors from a new perspective, that is, directly combining the performance measures computed on the ground truth generated by the crowd assessors instead of adopting some classification technique to merge the labels produced by them. We propose several unsupervised estimators that instantiate the AWARE framework and we compare them with state-of-the-art approaches, that is,Majoriity Vote and Expectation Maximization, on TREC collections. We found that AWARE approaches improve in terms of their capability of correctly ranking systems and predicting their actual performance scores.},

abstract = {Cold-start recommendation is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. An important approach to cold-start recommendation is to conduct an interview for new users, called the interview-based approach. Among the interview-based methods, Representative-Based Matrix Factorization (RBMF) [24] provides an effective solution with appealing merits: it represents users over selected representative items, which makes the recommendations highly intuitive and interpretable. However, RBMF only utilizes a global set of representative items to model all users. Such a representation is somehow too strict and may not be flexible enough to capture varying users’ interests. To address this problem, we propose a novel interview-based model to dynamically create meaningful user groups using decision trees and then select local representative items for different groups. A two-round interview is performed for a new user. In the first round, l1 global questions are issued for group division, while in the second round, l2 local-group-specific questions are given to derive local representation. We collect the feedback on the (l1+l2) items to learn the user representations. By putting these steps together, we develop a joint optimization model, named local representative-based matrix factorization, for new user recommendations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with several competitive baselines.},

In this work, we carry out two complementary studies to investigate the impact of response latency on users’ searching behaviour in web search engines. We first conduct a controlled user study to investigate the sensitivity of users to increasing delays in response latency. This study shows that the users of a fast search system are more sensitive to delays than the users of a slow search system. Moreover, the study finds that users are more likely to notice the response latency delays beyond a certain latency threshold, their search experience potentially being affected. We then analyse a large number of search queries obtained from Yahoo Web Search to investigate the impact of response latency on users’ click behaviour. This analysis demonstrates the significant change in click behaviour as the response latency increases. We also find that certain user, context, and query attributes play a role in the way increasing response latency affects the click behaviour. To demonstrate a possible use case for our findings, we devise a machine-learning framework that leverages the latency impact, together with other features, to predict whether a user will issue any clicks on web search results. As a further extension of this use case, we investigate whether this machine-learning framework can be exploited to help search engines reduce their energy consumption during query processing.},

abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) is well-known for the great number of adopted evaluation measures, with new ones popping up more and more frequently. In this context, correlation analysis is the tool used to study the evaluation measures and to let us understand if two measures rank systems similarly, if they grasp different aspects of system performances or actually reflect different user models, if a new measure is well motivated or not. To this end, the two most commonly used correlation coefficients are the Kendall’s τ correlation and the AP correlation τAP.The goal of the article is to investigate the properties of the tool, that is, correlation analysis, we use to study evaluation measures. In particular, we investigate three research questions about these two correlation coefficients: (i) what is the effect of the number of systems and topics? (ii) what is the effect of removing low-performing systems? (iii) what is the effect of the experimental collections?To answer these research questions, we propose a methodology based on General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) to isolate the effects of the number of topics, number of systems, and experimental collections and to let us observe expected correlation values, net from these effects, which are stable and reliable.We learned that the effect of the number of topics is more prominent than the effect of the number of systems. Even if it produces different absolute values, the effect of removing low-performing systems does not seem to provide information substantially different from not removing them, especially when comparing a whole set of evaluation measures. Finally, we found out that both document corpora and topic sets affect the correlation among evaluation measures, the effect of the latter being more prominent. Moreover, there is a substantial interaction between evaluation measures, corpora and topic sets, meaning that the correlation between different evaluation measures can be substantially increased or decreased depending on the different corpora and topics at hand.},

Randomly partitioning the test document collection allows for multiple tests of a given system and topic (replicates). Bootstrap ANOVA can use these replicates to extract system-topic interactions—something not possible without replicates—yielding a more precise value for the system effect and a narrower confidence interval around that value. Experiments using multiple TREC collections demonstrate that removing the topic-system interactions substantially reduces the confidence intervals around the system effect as well as increases the number of significant pairwise differences found. Further, the method is robust against small changes in the number of partitions used, against variability in the documents that constitute the partitions, and the measure of effectiveness used to quantify system effectiveness.},

abstract = {In recent years, mobile devices have become the most popular interface for users to retrieve and access information: recent reports show that users spend significantly more time and issue more search queries on mobile devices than on desktops in the United States.1 The accelerated growth of mobile usage brings unique opportunities to the information retrieval and data mining research communities.Mobile devices capture rich contextual and personal signals that can be leveraged to accurately predict users’ intent for serving more relevant content and can even proactively provide novel zero-query recommendations. Apple Siri, Google Now, and Microsoft Cortana are recent examples of such emerging systems. Furthermore, mobile devices constantly generate a huge amount of sensor footprints (e.g., GPS, motion sensors) and user activity data (e.g., used apps) that are often missing from their desktop counterparts. These new sources of implicit and explicit user feedback are valuable for discovering actionable knowledge, and designing better systems that serve each individual the right content at the right time and location. In addition, by aggregating mobile interactions across individuals, one can infer interesting conclusions beyond search and recommendation. Generating real-time traffic estimates is one example of such applications.This special issue focuses on research problems of search, mining, and their applications in mobile devices. Topics of interest in this special issue include but are not limited to mobile data mining and management, mobile search, personalization and recommendation, mobile user interfaces and human-computer interaction, and new applications in the mobile environment. The aim of this special issue is to bring together top experts across multiple disciplines, including information retrieval, data mining, mobile computing, and cyberphysical systems, such that academic and industrial researchers can exchange ideas and share the latest developments on the state of the art and practice of mobile search and mobile data mining.},

abstract = {Many applications require semantic understanding of short texts, and inferring discriminative and coherent latent topics is a critical and fundamental task in these applications. Conventional topic models largely rely on word co-occurrences to derive topics from a collection of documents. However, due to the length of each document, short texts are much more sparse in terms of word co-occurrences. Recent studies show that the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model is effective for topic inference over short texts by assuming that each piece of short text is generated by a single topic. However, DMM has two main limitations. First, even though it seems reasonable to assume that each short text has only one topic because of its shortness, the definition of “shortness” is subjective and the length of the short texts is dataset dependent. That is, the single-topic assumption may be too strong for some datasets. To address this limitation, we propose to model the topic number as a Poisson distribution, allowing each short text to be associated with a small number of topics (e.g., one to three topics). This model is named PDMM. Second, DMM (and also PDMM) does not have access to background knowledge (e.g., semantic relations between words) when modeling short texts. When a human being interprets a piece of short text, the understanding is not solely based on its content words, but also their semantic relations. Recent advances in word embeddings offer effective learning of word semantic relations from a large corpus. Such auxiliary word embeddings enable us to address the second limitation. To this end, we propose to promote the semantically related words under the same topic during the sampling process, by using the generalized P\'{o}lya urn (GPU) model. Through the GPU model, background knowledge about word semantic relations learned from millions of external documents can be easily exploited to improve topic modeling for short texts. By directly extending the PDMM model with the GPU model, we propose two more effective topic models for short texts, named GPU-DMM and GPU-PDMM. Through extensive experiments on two real-world short text collections in two languages, we demonstrate that PDMM achieves better topic representations than state-of-the-art models, measured by topic coherence. The learned topic representation leads to better accuracy in a text classification task, as an indirect evaluation. Both GPU-DMM and GPU-PDMM further improve topic coherence and text classification accuracy. GPU-PDMM outperforms GPU-DMM at the price of higher computational costs.},

The new approach uses a linear projection technique in the textstream compression process, achieving fast compression speed and low compression ratio. Two processes are executed by designing elaborated parallel procedures for efficient compressing and decompressing of large-scale textstreams. The decompression process is implemented for approximate solutions of underdetermined linear systems. Experimental results show that the new method can efficiently achieve the compression and decompression tasks on a large amount of text generated by social networks.},

As none of the existing methods for InfMax are efficient enough for the task in large networks, we propose LISA (sub-Linear Influence Spectrum Approximation), an efficient approximation algorithm for InfSpec (and also InfMax) with the best-known worst-case guarantees for billion-scale networks. LISA returns an (1-1/e -ϵ)-approximate influence spectrum with high probability (1-δ), where ϵ, δ are precision parameters provided by users. Using statistical decision theory, LISA has an asymptotic optimal running time (in addition to optimal approximation guarantee). In practice, LISA surpasses the state-of-the-art InfMax methods, taking less than 15 minutes to process a network of 41.7 million nodes and 1.5 billions edges.},

Inference of personal wellness--related attributes, such as body mass index (BMI) category or disease tendency, as well as understanding of global dependencies between wellness attributes and users’ behavior, is of crucial importance to various applications in personal and public wellness domains. At the same time, the emergence of social media platforms and wearable sensors makes it feasible to perform wellness profiling for users from multiple perspectives. However, research efforts on wellness profiling and integration of social media and sensor data are relatively sparse. This study represents one of the first attempts in this direction. Specifically, we infer personal wellness attributes by utilizing our proposed multisource multitask wellness profile learning framework—WellMTL—which can handle data incompleteness and perform wellness attributes inference from sensor and social media data simultaneously. To gain insights into the data at a global level, we also examine correlations between first-order data representations and personal wellness attributes. Our experimental results show that the integration of sensor data and multiple social media sources can substantially boost the performance of individual wellness profiling.},

abstract = {A considerable amount of research has been devoted to the proposition of scalable algorithms for influence maximization. A number of such scalable algorithms exploit the community structure of the network. Besides the community structure, real-world social networks possess a different property, known as the layer structure. In this article, we propose a method based on the layer structure to maximize the influence in huge networks. Conducting experiments on a number of real-world networks, we will show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by its time complexity while having similar or slightly better final influence spread. Furthermore, unlike its predecessors, our method is able to show a high entanglement between structure and dynamics by giving insight on the reason why different networks have two contrasting behaviors in their saturation. By “saturation,” we mean a state during the seed selection process after which adjoining new nodes to the initial set will have a negligible effect on increasing the influence spread. We will demonstrate that how our method can predict the saturation dynamics in the networks. This prediction can be used to identify the network structures that are more vulnerable to the fast spread of the rumors.},

abstract = {With the widespread usage of smart phones, more and more mobile apps are developed every day, playing an increasingly important role in changing our lifestyles and business models. In this trend, it becomes a hot research topic for developing effective mobile app recommender systems in both industry and academia. Compared with existing studies about mobile app recommendations, our research aims to improve the recommendation effectiveness based on analyzing a psychological trait of human beings, exploratory behavior, which refers to a type of variety-seeking behavior in unfamiliar domains. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic model named Goal-oriented Exploratory Model (GEM), integrating exploratory behavior identification with personalized item recommendation. An algorithm combining collapsed Gibbs sampling and Expectation Maximization is developed for model learning and inference. Through extensive experiments conducted on a real dataset, the proposed model demonstrates superior recommendation performances and good interpretability compared with state-of-art recommendation methods. Moreover, empirical analyses on exploratory behavior find that individuals with a strong exploratory tendency exhibit behavioral patterns of variety seeking, risk taking, and higher involvement. Besides, mobile apps that are less popular or in the long tail possess greater potential of arousing exploratory behavior in individuals.},

Recent advances in crowdsourcing, the sheer number of Internet and mobile users, and the commercial availability of supporting platforms offer new tools for knowledge acquisition. This article applies context-aware knowledge acquisition that simultaneously satisfies users’ immediate information needs while extending its own knowledge using crowdsourcing. The focus is on knowledge acquisition on a mobile device, which makes the approach practical and scalable; in this context, we propose and implement a new KA approach that exploits an existing knowledge base to drive the KA process, communicate with the right people, and check for consistency of the user-provided answers. We tested the viability of the approach in experiments using our platform with real users around the world, and an existing large source of common-sense background knowledge. These experiments show that the approach is promising: the knowledge is estimated to be true and useful for users 95% of the time. Using context to proactively drive knowledge acquisition increased engagement and effectiveness (the number of new assertions/day/user increased for 175%). Using pre-existing and newly acquired knowledge also proved beneficial.},

abstract = {Intelligent personal assistants on mobile devices such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Cortana are increasingly important. Instead of passively reacting to queries, they provide users with brand new proactive experiences that aim to offer the right information at the right time. It is, therefore, crucial for personal assistants to understand users’ intent, that is, what information users need now. Intent is closely related to context. Various contextual signals, including spatio-temporal information and users’ activities, can signify users’ intent. It is, however, challenging to model the correlation between intent and context. Intent and context are highly dynamic and often sequentially correlated. Contextual signals are usually sparse, heterogeneous, and not simultaneously available. We propose an innovative collaborative nowcasting model to jointly address all these issues. The model effectively addresses the complex sequential and concurring correlation between context and intent and recognizes users’ real-time intent with continuously arrived contextual signals. We extensively evaluate the proposed model with real-world data sets from a commercial personal assistant. The results validate the effectiveness the proposed model, and demonstrate its capability of handling the real-time flow of contextual signals. The studied problem and model also provide inspiring implications for new paradigms of recommendation on mobile intelligent devices.},

abstract = {Two characteristics of location-based services are mobile trajectories and the ability to facilitate social networking. The recording of trajectory data contributes valuable resources towards understanding users’ geographical movement behaviors. Social networking is possible when users are able to quickly connect to anyone nearby. A social network with location based services is known as location-based social network (LBSN). As shown in Cho et al. [2013], locations that are frequently visited by socially related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. To better analyze and mine LBSN data, we need to have a comprehensive view of each of these two aspects, i.e., the mobile trajectory data and the social network.Specifically, we present a novel neural network model that can jointly model both social networks and mobile trajectories. Our model consists of two components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile trajectories. First we adopt a network embedding method for the construction of social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key to our model lies in generating mobile trajectories. Second, we consider four factors that influence the generation process of mobile trajectories: user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term sequential contexts, and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential relatedness in mobile trajectories at the short or long term levels. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In particular, the improvement over baselines is more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.},

abstract = {Nutrient-based meal recommendations have the potential to help individuals prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes and obesity. However, learning people’s food preferences and making recommendations that simultaneously appeal to their palate and satisfy nutritional expectations are challenging. Existing approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized nutrient-based meal recommender system designed to meet individuals’ nutritional expectations, dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via a visual quiz-based user interface and projects the learned profile into the domain of nutritionally appropriate food options to find ones that will appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me and further describe and evaluate two innovative contributions. The first contriution is an open source state-of-the-art food image analysis model, named FoodDist. We demonstrate FoodDist’s superior performance through careful benchmarking and discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. The second contribution is a novel online learning framework that learns food preference from itemwise and pairwise image comparisons. We evaluate the framework in a field study of 227 anonymous users and demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. We further conducted an end-to-end validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63%.},

abstract = {User clustering has been studied from different angles. In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

Clearly, identifying hot topics that users greatly care about can improve readers’ news browsing experience and facilitate research into interaction analysis between news and UGC. Furthermore, it is of great benefit to public opinion monitoring and management for both industry and government agencies. However, it is extremely time consuming, if not impossible, to manually examine the large amount of available social content. In this article, we formally define the news comment alignment problem and propose a novel framework that: (1) automatically extracts topics from a given news article and its associated comments, (2) identifies and extends positive examples with different degrees of confidence using three methods (i.e., hypersphere, density, and cluster chain), and (3) completes the alignment between news sentences and comments through a weighted-SVM classifier. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

To capture the changes of topics and the probabilities of documents for a given query at a specific time in a short text stream, we propose a dynamic Dirichlet multinomial mixture topic model, called D2M3, as well as a Gibbs sampling algorithm for the inference. We also propose a streaming diversification algorithm, SDA, that integrates the information captured by D2M3 with our proposed modified version of the PM-2 (Proportionality-based diversification Method -- second version) diversification algorithm. We conduct experiments on a Twitter dataset and find that SDA statistically significantly outperforms state-of-the-art non-streaming retrieval methods, plain streaming retrieval methods, as well as streaming diversification methods that use other dynamic topic models.},

abstract = {Estimating urban traffic conditions of an arterial network with GPS probe data is a practically important while substantially challenging problem, and has attracted increasing research interests recently. Although GPS probe data is becoming a ubiquitous data source for various traffic related applications currently, they are usually insufficient for fully estimating traffic conditions of a large arterial network due to the low sampling frequency. To explore other data sources for more effectively computing urban traffic conditions, we propose to collect various traffic events such as traffic accident and jam from social media as complementary information. In addition, to further explore other factors that might affect traffic conditions, we also extract rich auxiliary information including social events, road features, Point of Interest (POI), and weather. With the enriched traffic data and auxiliary information collected from different sources, we first study the traffic co-congestion pattern mining problem with the aim of discovering which road segments geographically close to each other are likely to co-occur traffic congestion. A search tree based approach is proposed to efficiently discover the co-congestion patterns. These patterns are then used to help estimate traffic congestions and detect anomalies in a transportation network. To fuse the multisourced data, we finally propose a coupled matrix and tensor factorization model named TCE_R to more accurately complete the sparse traffic congestion matrix by collaboratively factorizing it with other matrices and tensors formed by other data. We evaluate the proposed model on the arterial network of downtown Chicago with 1,257 road segments whose total length is nearly 700 miles. The results demonstrate the superior performance of TCE_R by comprehensive comparison with existing approaches.},

In this article, we harness the power of network and data sciences to model the interplay between user demographics and social behavior and further study to what extent users’ demographic profiles can be inferred from their mobile communication patterns. By modeling over 7 million users and 1 billion mobile communication records, we find that during the active dating period (i.e., 18--35 years old), users are active in broadening social connections with males and females alike, while after reaching 35 years of age people tend to keep small, closed, and same-gender social circles. Further, we formalize the demographic prediction problem of inferring users’ gender and age simultaneously. We propose a factor graph-based WhoAmI method to address the problem by leveraging not only the correlations between network features and users’ gender/age, but also the interrelations between gender and age. In addition, we identify a new problem—coupled network demographic prediction across multiple mobile operators—and present a coupled variant of the WhoAmI method to address its unique challenges. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and applicability of the WhoAmI methods. Finally, our study finds a greater than 80% potential predictability for inferring users’ gender from phone call behavior and 73% for users’ age from text messaging interactions.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the renaissance of Web technologies has transformed the online world into an application (App) driven society. While the abundant Apps have provided great convenience, their sheer number also leads to severe information overload, making it difficult for users to identify desired Apps. To alleviate the information overloading issue, recommender systems have been proposed and deployed for the App domain. However, existing work on App recommendation has largely focused on one single platform (e.g., smartphones), while it ignores the rich data of other relevant platforms (e.g., tablets and computers).In this article, we tackle the problem of cross-platform App recommendation, aiming at leveraging users’ and Apps’ data on multiple platforms to enhance the recommendation accuracy. The key advantage of our proposal is that by leveraging multiplatform data, the perpetual issues in personalized recommender systems—data sparsity and cold-start—can be largely alleviated. To this end, we propose a hybrid solution, STAR (short for “croSs-plaTform App Recommendation”) that integrates both numerical ratings and textual content from multiple platforms. In STAR, we innovatively represent an App as an aggregation of common features across platforms (e.g., App’s functionalities) and specific features that are dependent on the resided platform. In light of this, STAR can discriminate a user’s preference on an App by separating the user’s interest into two parts (either in the App’s inherent factors or platform-aware features). To evaluate our proposal, we construct two real-world datasets that are crawled from the App stores of iPhone, iPad, and iMac. Through extensive experiments, we show that our STAR method consistently outperforms highly competitive recommendation methods, justifying the rationality of our cross-platform App recommendation proposal and the effectiveness of our solution.},

Investigating how people manage mobile apps in their everyday lives creates a unique opportunity to understand the behavior and preferences of mobile device users, infer the quality of apps, and improve user experience. Existing literature provides very limited knowledge about app management activities, due to the lack of app usage data at scale. This article takes the initiative to analyze a very large app management log collected through a leading Android app marketplace. The dataset covers 5 months of detailed downloading, updating, and uninstallation activities, which involve 17 million anonymized users and 1 million apps. We present a surprising finding that the metrics commonly used to rank apps in app stores do not truly reflect the users’ real attitudes. We then identify behavioral patterns from the app management activities that more accurately indicate user preferences of an app even when no explicit rating is available. A systematic statistical analysis is designed to evaluate machine learning models that are trained to predict user preferences using these behavioral patterns, which features an inverse probability weighting method to correct the selection biases in the training process.},

We solve these by (1) segmenting a screenshot into structural units called blocks, (2) formulating effective search queries by considering the role of each block, and (3) aggregating the search result lists of multiple queries. To improve efficiency, we also extend our approach with learning-to-rank techniques so that we can find the desired article with only one query. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high retrieval performance (F1 = 0.868), which outperforms baselines based on keyword extraction and chunking methods. Learning-to-rank models improve our approach without learning by about 6%.

abstract = {Recently, location-based services (LBSs) have been increasingly popular for people to experience new possibilities, for example, personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendations that leverage on the overlapping of user trajectories to recommend POI collaboratively. POI recommendation is yet challenging as it suffers from the problems known for the conventional recommendation tasks such as data sparsity and cold start, and to a much greater extent. In the literature, most of the related works apply collaborate filtering to POI recommendation while overlooking the personalized time-variant human behavioral tendency. In this article, we put forward a fourth-order tensor factorization-based ranking methodology to recommend users their interested locations by considering their time-varying behavioral trends while capturing their long-term preferences and short-term preferences simultaneously. We also propose to categorize the locations to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues, and accordingly new POIs that users have not visited can thus be bubbled up during the category ranking process. The tensor factorization is carefully studied to prune the irrelevant factors to the ranking results to achieve efficient POI recommendations. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed mechanism, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly.},

abstract = {The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has increased significantly in recent decades, and this trend is expected to continue. Hence, understanding and predicting human evacuation behavior and mobility will play a vital role in planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, existing models are shallow models, and it is difficult to apply them for understanding the “deep knowledge” of human mobility. Therefore, in this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records of 1.6 million users over 3 years, data on earthquakes that have occurred in Japan over 4 years, news report data, and transportation network data), and we build an intelligent system, namely, DeepMob, for understanding and predicting human evacuation behavior and mobility following different types of natural disasters. The key component of DeepMob is based on a deep learning architecture that aims to understand the basic laws that govern human behavior and mobility following natural disasters, from big and heterogeneous data. Furthermore, based on the deep learning model, DeepMob can accurately predict or simulate a person’s future evacuation behaviors or evacuation routes under different disaster conditions. Experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our system, and suggest that human mobility following disasters may be predicted and simulated more easily than previously thought.},

abstract = {With the great popularity of mobile devices, the amount of mobile apps has grown at a more dramatic rate than ever expected. A technical challenge is how to recommend suitable apps to mobile users. In this work, we identify and focus on a unique characteristic that exists in mobile app recommendation—that is, an app usually corresponds to multiple release versions. Based on this characteristic, we propose a fine-grain version-aware app recommendation problem. Instead of directly learning the users’ preferences over the apps, we aim to infer the ratings of users on a specific version of an app. However, the user-version rating matrix will be sparser than the corresponding user-app rating matrix, making existing recommendation methods less effective. In view of this, our approach has made two major extensions. First, we leverage the review text that is associated with each rating record; more importantly, we consider two types of version-based correlations. The first type is to capture the temporal correlations between multiple versions within the same app, and the second type of correlation is to capture the aggregation correlations between similar apps. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several competitive methods.},

abstract = {Short-head and long-tail distributed data are widely observed in the real world. The same is true of recommender systems (RSs), where a small number of popular items dominate the choices and feedback data while the rest only account for a small amount of feedback. As a result, most RS methods tend to learn user preferences from popular items since they account for most data. However, recent research in e-commerce and marketing has shown that future businesses will obtain greater profit from long-tail selling. Yet, although the number of long-tail items and users is much larger than that of short-head items and users, in reality, the amount of data associated with long-tail items and users is much less. As a result, user preferences tend to be popularity-biased. Furthermore, insufficient data makes long-tail items and users more vulnerable to shilling attack. To improve the quality of recommendations for items and users in the tail of distribution, we propose a coupled regularization approach that consists of two latent factor models: C-HMF, for enhancing credibility, and S-HMF, for emphasizing specialty on user choices. Specifically, the estimates learned from C-HMF and S-HMF recurrently serve as the empirical priors to regularize one another. Such coupled regularization leads to the comprehensive effects of final estimates, which produce more qualitative predictions for both tail users and tail items. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct empirical evaluations on large real-world datasets with various metrics. The results prove that our approach significantly outperforms the compared methods.},

However, applying IDF to word N-grams (or simply N-grams) of any length without relying on heuristics has remained a challenging issue. This article describes a theoretical extension of IDF to handle N-grams. First, we elucidate the theoretical relationship between IDF and information distance, a universal metric defined by the Kolmogorov complexity. Based on our understanding of this relationship, we propose N-gram IDF, a new IDF family that gives fair weights to words and phrases of any length. Based only on the magnitude relation of N-gram IDF weights, dominant N-grams among overlapping N-grams can be determined. We also propose an efficient method to compute the N-gram IDF weights of all N-grams by leveraging the enhanced suffix array and wavelet tree. Because the exact computation of N-gram IDF provably requires significant computational cost, we modify it to a fast approximation method that can estimate weight errors analytically and maintain application-level performance. Empirical evaluations with unsupervised/supervised key term extraction and web search query segmentation with various experimental settings demonstrate the robustness and language-independent nature of the proposed N-gram IDF.},

Many neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recursive Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been proposed to learn representations of phrase/sentence, however, rich syntactic knowledge has not been fully explored when composing a longer text from its shorter constituent words. In most traditional models, only word embeddings are utilized to compose phrase/sentence representations, while the syntactic information of words is yet to be explored. In this article, we discover that encoding syntactic knowledge (part-of-speech tag) in neural networks can enhance sentence/phrase representation. Specifically, we propose to learn tag-specific composition functions and tag embeddings in recursive neural networks, and propose to utilize POS tags to control the gates of tree-structured LSTM networks. We evaluate these models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment classification, and demonstrate that improvements can be obtained with such syntactic knowledge encoded.},

abstract = {Information retrieval systems aim to help users satisfy information needs. We argue that the goal of the person using the system, and the pattern of behavior that they exhibit as they proceed to attain that goal, should be incorporated into the methods and techniques used to evaluate the effectiveness of IR systems, so that the resulting effectiveness scores have a useful interpretation that corresponds to the users’ search experience. In particular, we investigate the role of search task complexity, and show that it has a direct bearing on the number of relevant answer documents sought by users in response to an information need, suggesting that useful effectiveness metrics must be goal sensitive. We further suggest that user behavior while scanning results listings is affected by the rate at which their goal is being realized, and hence that appropriate effectiveness metrics must be adaptive to the presence (or not) of relevant documents in the ranking. In response to these two observations, we present a new effectiveness metric, INST, that has both of the desired properties: INST employs a parameter T, a direct measure of the user’s search goal that adjusts the top-weightedness of the evaluation score; moreover, as progress towards the target T is made, the modeled user behavior is adapted, to reflect the remaining expectations. INST is experimentally compared to previous effectiveness metrics, including Average Precision (AP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Rank-Biased Precision (RBP), demonstrating our claims as to INST’s usefulness. Like RBP, INST is a weighted-precision metric, meaning that each score can be accompanied by a residual that quantifies the extent of the score uncertainty caused by unjudged documents. As part of our experimentation, we use crowd-sourced data and score residuals to demonstrate that a wide range of queries arise for even quite specific information needs, and that these variant queries introduce significant levels of residual uncertainty into typical experimental evaluations. These causes of variability have wide-reaching implications for experiment design, and for the construction of test collections.},

abstract = {The exponential increase of online videos greatly enriches the life of users but also brings huge numbers of near-duplicate videos (NDVs) that seriously challenge the video websites. The video websites entail NDV-related applications such as detection of copyright violation, video monitoring, video re-ranking, and video recommendation. Since these applications adopt different features and different processing procedures due to diverse scenarios, constructing separate and special-purpose systems for them incurs considerable costs on design, implementation, and maintenance. In this article, we propose a general NDV system on Storm (GVoS)—a popular distributed real-time stream processing platform—to simultaneously support a wide variety of video applications. The generality of GVoS is achieved in two aspects. First, we extract the reusable components from various applications. Second, we conduct the communication between components via a mechanism called Stream Shared Message (SSM) that contains the video-related data. Furthermore, we present an algorithm to reduce the size of SSM in order to avoid the data explosion and decrease the network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that GVoS can achieve performance almost the same as the customized systems. Meanwhile, GVoS accomplishes remarkably higher systematic versatility and efficiently facilitates the development of various NDV-related applications.},

In this article, we quantitatively explore how well indexed and archived Arabic language webpages are as compared to those from other languages. We began by sampling 15,092 unique URIs from three different website directories: DMOZ (multilingual), Raddadi, and Star28 (the last two primarily Arabic language). Using language identification tools, we eliminated pages not in the Arabic language (e.g., English-language versions of Aljazeera pages) and culled the collection to 7,976 Arabic language webpages. We then used these 7,976 pages and crawled the live web and web archives to produce a collection of 300,646 Arabic language pages. We compared the analysis of Arabic language pages with that of English, Danish, and Korean language pages. First, for each language, we sampled unique URIs from DMOZ; then, using language identification tools, we kept only pages in the desired language. Finally, we crawled the archived and live web to collect a larger sample of pages in English, Danish, or Korean. In total for the four languages, we analyzed over 500,000 webpages. We discovered: (1) English has a higher archiving rate than Arabic, with 72.04% archived. However, Arabic has a higher archiving rate than Danish and Korean, with 53.36% of Arabic URIs archived, followed by Danish and Korean with 35.89% and 32.81% archived, respectively. (2) Most Arabic and English language pages are located in the United States; only 14.84% of the Arabic URIs had an Arabic country code top-level domain (e.g., sa) and only 10.53% had a GeoIP in an Arabic country. Most Danish-language pages were located in Denmark, and most Korean-language pages were located in South Korea. (3) The presence of a webpage in a directory positively impacts indexing and presence in the DMOZ directory, specifically, positively impacts archiving in all four languages. In this work, we show that web archives and search engines favor English pages. However, it is not universally true for all Western-language webpages because, in this work, we show that Arabic webpages have a higher archival rate than Danish language webpages.},

In this work, we investigate re-finding in the context of vertical search, differentiating and modeling user re-finding behavior within different media and topic domains, including images, news, reference material, and movies. We distinguish the re-finding behavior in vertical domains from re-finding in a general search context and engineer features that are effective in differentiating re-finding across the domains. The features are then used to build machine-learned models, achieving an accuracy of re-finding detection in verticals of 85.7% on average. Our results demonstrate that detecting re-finding in specific verticals is more difficult than examining re-finding for general search tasks. We then investigate the effectiveness of differentiating re-finding behavior in two restricted contexts: We consider the case where the history of a searcher’s interactions with the search system is not available. In this scenario, our features and models achieve an average accuracy of 77.5% across the domains. We then examine the detection of re-finding during the early part of a search session. Both of these restrictions represent potential real-world search scenarios, where a system is attempting to learn about a user but may have limited information available. Finally, we investigate in which types of domains re-finding is most difficult. Here, it would appear that re-finding images is particularly challenging for users. This research has implications for search engine design, in terms of adapting search results by predicting the type of user tasks and potentially enabling the presentation of vertical-specific results when re-finding is identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the issue of vertical re-finding.},

In such applications, dynamic news feeds are regarded as queries to match against an advertisement (ad) database for retrieving the k most relevant ads. The existing approaches to keyword retrieval cannot work well in this search scenario when queries are triggered at a very high frequency. To address the problem, we introduce new techniques to significantly improve search performance. First, we devise a two-level partitioning for tight upper bound estimation and a lazy evaluation scheme to delay full evaluation of unpromising candidates, which can bring three to four times performance boosting in a database with 7 million ads. Second, we propose a novel rank-aware block-oriented inverted index to further improve performance. In this index scheme, each entry in an inverted list is assigned a rank according to its importance in the ad. Then, we introduce a block-at-a-time search strategy based on the index scheme to support a much tighter upper bound estimation and a very early termination. We have conducted experiments with real datasets, and the results show that the rank-aware method can further improve performance by an order of magnitude.},

Proactively prefetching landing pages in advance of clickthrough can save searchers valuable time. However, prefetching consumes resources (primarily bandwidth and battery) that are wasted unless the prefetched results are requested by searchers. Balancing the costs in prefetching particular results against the benefits in reduced latency to searchers represents the search result prefetching challenge. In this article, we introduce this challenge and present methods to address it in both desktop and mobile settings. Our methods leverage searchers’ cursor movements (on desktop) and viewport-based viewing behavior (on mobile) on search engine result pages (SERPs) in real time to dynamically estimate the result that searchers will request next. We demonstrate through large-scale log analysis that our approach significantly outperforms three strong baselines that prefetch results based on (i) the search engine result ranking (prefetch top-ranked results), (ii) past SERP clicks from all searchers for the query (prefetch popular results), or (iii) past SERP clicks from the current searcher for the query (prefetch results that the searcher prefers).

Compared to mono online social networking services (e.g., Twitter and Google+), such dual networks provide a complete picture of users’ online and offline behaviors that more often than not are compatible and complementary. In the light of this, we argue that joint learning over dual networks offers us a better way to comprehensively understand user behaviors and their underlying organizational principles. Despite its value, few efforts have been dedicated to jointly considering the following factors within a unified model: (1) local user contextualization, (2) global structure coherence, and (3) effectiveness evaluation. Toward this end, we propose a novel dual clustering model for community detection over dual networks to jointly model local consistency for a specific user and global consistency of partitioning results across networks. We theoretically derived its solution. In addition, we verified our model regarding multiple metrics from different aspects and applied it to the application of event attendance prediction.},

abstract = {We introduce a new representation of the inverted index that performs faster ranked unions and intersections while using similar space. Our index is based on the treap data structure, which allows us to intersect/merge the document identifiers while simultaneously thresholding by frequency, instead of the costlier two-step classical processing methods. To achieve compression, we represent the treap topology using different alternative compact data structures. Further, the treap invariants allow us to elegantly encode differentially both document identifiers and frequencies. We also show how to extend this representation to support incremental updates over the index. Results show that, under the tf-idf scoring scheme, our index uses about the same space as state-of-the-art compact representations, while performing up to 2--20 times faster on ranked single-word, union, or intersection queries. Under the BM25 scoring scheme, our index may use up to 40% more space than the others and outperforms them less frequently but still reaches improvement factors of 2--20 in the best cases. The index supporting incremental updates poses an overhead of 50%--100% over the static variants in terms of space, construction, and query time.},

For instance, SBS Transit in Singapore can reach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than $35 million. To bridge the gap, we propose a probabilistic data model that captures the motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an advertisement among the passengers. In particular, we leverage hundreds of millions of bus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as the extent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model, we study a top-k retrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation, which acts as a primitive operator to support various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to support real-time decision making. In the experimental study, we use the dataset from SBS Transit as a case study to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies.},

abstract = {Magnitude estimation is a psychophysical scaling technique for the measurement of sensation, where observers assign numbers to stimuli in response to their perceived intensity. We investigate the use of magnitude estimation for judging the relevance of documents for information retrieval evaluation, carrying out a large-scale user study across 18 TREC topics and collecting over 50,000 magnitude estimation judgments using crowdsourcing. Our analysis shows that magnitude estimation judgments can be reliably collected using crowdsourcing, are competitive in terms of assessor cost, and are, on average, rank-aligned with ordinal judgments made by expert relevance assessors.We explore the application of magnitude estimation for IR evaluation, calibrating two gain-based effectiveness metrics, nDCG and ERR, directly from user-reported perceptions of relevance. A comparison of TREC system effectiveness rankings based on binary, ordinal, and magnitude estimation relevance shows substantial variation; in particular, the top systems ranked using magnitude estimation and ordinal judgments differ substantially. Analysis of the magnitude estimation scores shows that this effect is due in part to varying perceptions of relevance: different users have different perceptions of the impact of relative differences in document relevance. These results have direct implications for IR evaluation, suggesting that current assumptions about a single view of relevance being sufficient to represent a population of users are unlikely to hold.},

abstract = {Identifying topic trends on microblogging services such as Twitter and estimating those topics’ future popularity have great academic and business value, especially when the operations can be done in real time. For any third party, however, capturing and processing such huge volumes of real-time data in microblogs are almost infeasible tasks, as there always exist API (Application Program Interface) request limits, monitoring and computing budgets, as well as timeliness requirements. To deal with these challenges, we propose a cost-effective system framework with algorithms that can automatically select a subset of representative users in microblogging networks in offline, under given cost constraints. Then the proposed system can online monitor and utilize only these selected users’ real-time microposts to detect the overall trending topics and predict their future popularity among the whole microblogging network. Therefore, our proposed system framework is practical for real-time usage as it avoids the high cost in capturing and processing full real-time data, while not compromising detection and prediction performance under given cost constraints. Experiments with real microblogs dataset show that by tracking only 500 users out of 0.6 million users and processing no more than 30,000 microposts daily, about 92% trending topics could be detected and predicted by the proposed system and, on average, more than 10 hours earlier than they appear in official trends lists.},

abstract = {Most research into similarity search in metric spaces relies on the triangle inequality property. This property allows the space to be arranged according to relative distances to avoid searching some subspaces. We show that many common metric spaces, notably including those using Euclidean and Jensen-Shannon distances, also have a stronger property, sometimes called the four-point property: In essence, these spaces allow an isometric embedding of any four points in three-dimensional Euclidean space, as well as any three points in two-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact, we show that any space that is isometrically embeddable in Hilbert space has the stronger property. This property gives stronger geometric guarantees, and one in particular, which we name the Hilbert Exclusion property, allows any indexing mechanism which uses hyperplane partitioning to perform better. One outcome of this observation is that a number of state-of-the-art indexing mechanisms over high-dimensional spaces can be easily refined to give a significant increase in performance; furthermore, the improvement given is greater in higher dimensions. This therefore leads to a significant improvement in the cost of metric search in these spaces.},

abstract = {Click-through information is considered as a valuable source of users’ implicit relevance feedback for commercial search engines. As existing studies have shown that the search result position in a search engine result page (SERP) has a very strong influence on users’ examination behavior, most existing click models are position based, assuming that users examine results from top to bottom in a linear fashion. Although these click models have been successful, most do not take temporal information into account. As many existing studies have shown, click dwell time and click sequence information are strongly correlated with users’ perceived relevance and search satisfaction. Incorporating temporal information may be important to improve performance of user click models for Web searches. In this article, we investigate the problem of properly incorporating temporal information into click models. We first carry out a laboratory eye-tracking study to analyze users’ examination behavior in different click sequences and find that the user common examination path among adjacent clicks is linear. Next, we analyze the user dwell time distribution in different search logs and find that we cannot simply use a click dwell time threshold (e.g., 30 seconds) to distinguish relevant/irrelevant results. Finally, we propose a novel time-aware click model (TACM), which captures the temporal information of user behavior. We compare the TACM to several existing click models using two real-world search engine logs. Experimental results show that the TACM outperforms other click models in terms of both predicting click behavior (perplexity) and estimating result relevance (NDCG).},

abstract = {Learning-to-Rank models based on additive ensembles of regression trees have been proven to be very effective for scoring query results returned by large-scale Web search engines. Unfortunately, the computational cost of scoring thousands of candidate documents by traversing large ensembles of trees is high. Thus, several works have investigated solutions aimed at improving the efficiency of document scoring by exploiting advanced features of modern CPUs and memory hierarchies. In this article, we present QuickScorer, a new algorithm that adopts a novel cache-efficient representation of a given tree ensemble, performs an interleaved traversal by means of fast bitwise operations, and supports ensembles of oblivious trees. An extensive and detailed test assessment is conducted on two standard Learning-to-Rank datasets and on a novel very large dataset we made publicly available for conducting significant efficiency tests. The experiments show unprecedented speedups over the best state-of-the-art baselines ranging from 1.9 \texttimes{} to 6.6 \texttimes{} . The analysis of low-level profiling traces shows that QuickScorer efficiency is due to its cache-aware approach in terms of both data layout and access patterns and to a control flow that entails very low branch mis-prediction rates.},

abstract = {In the real-world environment, users have sufficient experience in their focused domains but lack experience in other domains. Recommender systems are very helpful for recommending potentially desirable items to users in unfamiliar domains, and cross-domain collaborative filtering is therefore an important emerging research topic. However, it is inevitable that the cold-start issue will be encountered in unfamiliar domains due to the lack of feedback data. The Bayesian approach shows that priors play an important role when there are insufficient data, which implies that recommendation performance can be significantly improved in cold-start domains if informative priors can be provided. Based on this idea, we propose a Weighted Irregular Tensor Factorization (WITF) model to leverage multi-domain feedback data across all users to learn the cross-domain priors w.r.t. both users and items. The features learned from WITF serve as the informative priors on the latent factors of users and items in terms of weighted matrix factorization models. Moreover, WITF is a unified framework for dealing with both explicit feedback and implicit feedback. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we studied three typical real-world cases in which a collection of empirical evaluations were conducted on real-world datasets to compare the performance of our model and other state-of-the-art approaches. The results show the superiority of our model over comparison models.},

This problem needs to be addressed since current online retailers are moving beyond single category and attempting to be diversified. In this article, we investigate the challenging problem of product recommendation in unexplored categories and discover that the price, a factor comparable across categories, can improve the recommendation performance significantly. We introduce the price utility concept to characterize users’ sense of price and propose three different utility functions. We show that user price preference in a category is a distribution and we mine typical user price preference patterns based on three different types of distance between distributions. We fuse user price preference through regularization and joint factorization to boost recommendation performance in both browsing and buying shopping orientations. Experimental results show that fusing user price preference improves performance in a series of recommendation tasks: unexplored category recommendation, product recommendation under a given unexplored category, and product recommendation under generic unexplored categories.},

abstract = {Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting places, especially when users travel out of town. However, the extreme sparsity of a user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge, we propose a unified probabilistic generative model, the Topic-Region Model (TRM), to simultaneously discover the semantic, temporal, and spatial patterns of users’ check-in activities, and to model their joint effect on users’ decision making for selection of POIs to visit. To demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of TRM, we investigate how it supports two recommendation scenarios in a unified way, that is, hometown recommendation and out-of-town recommendation. TRM effectively overcomes data sparsity by the complementarity and mutual enhancement of the diverse information associated with users’ check-in activities (e.g., check-in content, time, and location) in the processes of discovering heterogeneous patterns and producing recommendations. To support real-time POI recommendations, we further extend the TRM model to an online learning model, TRM-Online, to track changing user interests and speed up the model training. In addition, based on the learned model, we propose a clustering-based branch and bound algorithm (CBB) to prune the POI search space and facilitate fast retrieval of the top-k recommendations.We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposals on two real-world datasets, including recommendation effectiveness, overcoming the cold-start problem, recommendation efficiency, and model-training efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TRM models, especially TRM-Online, compared with state-of-the-art competitive methods, by making more effective and efficient mobile recommendations. In addition, we study the importance of each type of pattern in the two recommendation scenarios, respectively, and find that exploiting temporal patterns is most important for the hometown recommendation scenario, while the semantic patterns play a dominant role in improving the recommendation effectiveness for out-of-town users.},

abstract = {Aggregated search is the task of combining results from multiple independent search systems in a single Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Aggregated search coherence refers to the extent to which different sources on the SERP focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. In previous studies, we found that the query senses in a set of vertical results can influence user engagement with the web results (the so-called “spillover” effect). In this work, we investigate five research questions (RQ1--RQ5) that extend our prior work. First, we investigate the extent to which results from different sources focus on different senses of an ambiguous query (RQ1). Second, we investigate how the vertical-to-web spillover effect varies across different verticals (RQ2). Then, we examine whether the level of spillover depends on the vertical position (RQ3) and on whether the vertical results are displayed with a border and different-colored background to distinguish them from the web results (RQ4). Finally, we propose a new method for displaying results from a particular vertical that are more consistent with the query senses in the web results (RQ5). We evaluate this new method based on how it influences users to make more correct decisions with respect to the web results—to engage with the web results when at least one of them is relevant and to avoid engaging with the web results otherwise. Our results show the following trends. In terms of RQ1, our analysis suggests that the top results from the web search engine are more diversified than the top results from our four different verticals considered (images, news, shopping, and video). In terms of RQ2, we found a stronger spillover effect for the images vertical than the news, shopping, and video verticals. In terms of RQ3, we found a stronger level of spillover when the vertical was positioned at the top of the SERP versus to the right side of the web results. In terms of RQ4, we found an interesting additive effect between the vertical’s position and displaying the vertical results enclosed in a border and with a different-colored background—the image vertical had no spillover when presented to the right side of the web results and with a border and background. Finally, in terms of RQ5, we found that our proposed vertical results selection approach can influence users to make more correct predictions about their level of engagement with the web results.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most effective techniques in recommender systems, which can be either rating oriented or ranking oriented. Ranking-oriented CF algorithms demonstrated significant performance gains in terms of ranking accuracy, being able to estimate a precise preference ranking of items for each user rather than the absolute ratings (as rating-oriented CF algorithms do). Conventional memory-based ranking-oriented CF can be referred to as pairwise algorithms. They represent each user as a set of preferences on each pair of items for similarity calculations and predictions. In this study, we propose ListCF, a novel listwise CF paradigm that seeks improvement in both accuracy and efficiency in comparison with pairwise CF. In ListCF, each user is represented as a probability distribution of the permutations over rated items based on the Plackett-Luce model, and the similarity between users is measured based on the Kullback--Leibler divergence between their probability distributions over the set of commonly rated items. Given a target user and the most similar users, ListCF directly predicts a total order of items for each user based on similar users’ probability distributions over permutations of the items. Besides, we also reveal insightful connections among pointwise, pairwise, and listwise CF algorithms from the perspective of the matrix representations. In addition, to make our algorithm more scalable and adaptive, we present an incremental algorithm for ListCF, which allows incrementally updating the similarities between users when certain user submits a new rating or updates an existing rating. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promise of our approach.},

abstract = {Today, major commercial search engines are operating in a multinational fashion to provide web search services for millions of users who compose search queries by different languages. Hence, the search engine query log, which serves as the backbone of many search engine applications, records millions of users’ search history in a wide spectrum of human languages and demonstrates a strong multilingual phenomenon. However, with its salience, the multilingual nature of a search engine query log is usually ignored by existing works, which usually consider query log entries of different languages as being orthogonal and independent. This kind of oversimplified assumption heavily distorts the underlying structure of web search data. In this article, we pioneer in recognition of the multilingual nature of a query log and make the first attempt to cross the language barrier in query logs. We propose a novel model named Cross-Lingual Query Log Topic Model (CL-QLTM) to analyze query logs from a cross-lingual perspective and derive the latent topics of web search data. The CL-QLTM comprehensively integrates web search data in different languages by collectively utilizing cross-lingual dictionaries, as well as the co-occurrence relations in the query log. In order to relieve the efficiency bottleneck of applying the CL-QLTM on voluminous query logs, we propose an efficient parameter inference algorithm based on the MapReduce computing paradigm. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the CL-QLTM is able to effectively derive cross-lingual topics from multilingual query logs and spawn a wide spectrum of new search engine applications.},

Personalized trip recommendation tailors to users’ specific tastes by learning from past check-in behaviors of users and their peers. Finding the optimal trip that maximizes user’s experiences for a given time budget constraint is an NP-hard problem and previous solutions do not consider three practical and important constraints. One constraint is POI availability, where a POI may be only available during a certain time window. Another constraint is uncertain traveling time, where the traveling time between two POIs is uncertain. In addition, the diversity of the POIs included in the trip plays an important role in user’s final adoptions. This work presents efficient solutions to personalized trip recommendation by incorporating these constraints and leveraging them to prune the search space.

abstract = {A Question Answering (QA) system is concerned with building a system that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. Compared to other languages, little effort was directed towards QA systems for Arabic. Due to the difficulty of handling why-questions, most Arabic QA systems tend to ignore it. In this article, we specifically address the why-question for Arabic using two different approaches and compare their performance and the quality of their answer. The first is the baseline approach, a generic method that is used to answer all types of questions, including factoid; and for the second approach, we use Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). We evaluate both schemes using a corpus of 700 textual documents in different genres collected from Open Source Arabic Corpora (OSAC), and a set of 100 question-answer pairs. Overall, the performance measures of recall, precision, and c@1 was 68% (all three measures) for the baseline approach, and 71%, 78%, and 77.4%, respectively, for the RST-based approach. The recently introduced extension of the accuracy, the c@1 measure, rewards unanswered questions over those wrongly answered.},

abstract = {With the pervasiveness of location-based social networks, it becomes increasingly important to consider the social characteristics of locations shared among persons. Several studies have been proposed to infer social strength by using trajectory similarity. However, these studies have two major shortcomings. First, they rely on the explicit co-occurrence of check-in locations. In this situation, a user pair of two friends who seldom share common locations or a user pair of two strangers who heavily share common visited locations will receive an unreliable estimation of the real social strength between them. Second, these studies do not consider how the overall trajectory patterns of users change with the varying of living styles.In this article, we propose a probabilistic generative model to mine latent lifestyle-related patterns from human trajectory data for inferring social strength. It can automatically learn functionality topics consisting of locations with similar service functions and transition probabilities over the set of functionality topics. Furthermore, a lifestyle is modeled as a unique transition probability matrix over the set of functionality topics. A user has a preference distribution over the set of lifestyles, and he or she is able to select over multiple lifestyles to adapt to different living contexts. The learned lifestyle-related patterns are subsequently used as features in a supervised learner for both strength estimation and link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Although the task of matching questions to their best answers has been tackled for more than a decade, the social question-answering practice is a complex process. The factors influencing the accuracy of question-answer matching are many and hard to disentangle. We approach the task from an application-oriented perspective, probing the space of several dimensions relevant to this problem: features, algorithms, and topics. We gather under a learning to rank framework the most extensive feature set used in literature to date, including 225 features from five different families. We test the power of such features in predicting the best answer to a question on the largest dataset from Yahoo Answers used for this task so far (40M answers) and provide a faceted analysis of the results along different topical areas and question types. We propose a novel family of distributional semantics measures that most of the time can seamlessly replace widely used linguistic similarity features, being more than one order of magnitude faster to compute and providing greater predictive power. The best feature set reaches an improvement between 11% and 26% in P@1 compared to recent well-established state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Given a query document, ranking the documents in a collection based on how similar they are to the query is an essential task with extensive applications. For collections that contain documents whose creation dates span several decades, this task is further complicated by the fact that the language changes over time. For example, many terms add or lose one or more senses to meet people’s evolving needs. To address this problem, we present methods that take advantage of two types of information to account for the language change. The first is the citation network that often exists within the collection, which can be used to link related documents with significantly different creation dates (and hence different language use). The second is the changes in the usage frequency of terms that occur over time, which can indicate changes in their senses and uses. These methods utilize the preceding information while estimating the representation of both documents and terms within the context of nonprobabilistic static and dynamic topic models. Our experiments on two real-world datasets that span more than 40 years show that our proposed methods improve the retrieval performance of existing models and that these improvements are statistically significant.},

abstract = {Traditional pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) models choose top k feedback documents for query expansion and treat those documents equally. When k is determined, feedback terms are selected without considering the reliability of these documents for relevance. Because the performance of PRF is sensitive to the selection of feedback terms, noisy terms imported from these irrelevant documents or partially relevant documents will harm the final results extensively. Intuitively, terms in these documents should be considered less important for feedback term selection. Nonetheless, how to measure the reliability of feedback documents is a difficult problem.Recently, topic modeling has become more and more popular in the information retrieval (IR) area. In order to identify how reliable a feedback document is to be relevant, we attempt to adapt the topical information into PRF. However, topics are hard to be quantified and therefore the identification of topic is usually fuzzy. It is very challenging for integrating the obtained topical information effectively into IR and other text-processing-related areas. Current research work mainly focuses on mining relevant information from particular topics. This is extremely difficult when the boundaries of different topics are hard to define. In this article, we investigate a key factor of this problem, the topic number for topic modeling and how it makes topics “fuzzy.” To effectively and efficiently apply topical information, we propose a new probabilistic framework, “TopPRF,” and three models, TS-COS, TS-EU, and TS-Entropy, via integrating “Topic Space” (TS) information into pseudo relevance feedback. These methods discover how reliable a document is to be relevant through both term and topical information. When selecting feedback terms, candidate terms in more reliable feedback documents should obtain extra weights. Experimental results on various public collections justify that our proposed methods can significantly reduce the influence of “fuzzy topics” and obtain stable, good results over the strong baseline models. Our proposed probabilistic framework, TopPRF, and three topic-space-based models are capable of searching documents beyond traditional term matching only and provide a promising avenue for constructing better topic-space-based IR systems. Moreover, in-depth discussions and conclusions are made to help other researchers apply topical information effectively.},

The success of this simple yet effective approach coupled with the inherent parallelizability of the learning algorithm makes it a strong candidate for widespread adoption. In this article, we aim to better understand the effectiveness of RF-based rank-learning algorithms with a focus on the comparison between pointwise and listwise approaches.We introduce what we believe to be the first listwise version of an RF-based LtR algorithm. The algorithm directly optimizes an information retrieval metric of choice (in our case, NDCG) in a greedy manner. Direct optimization of the listwise objective functions is computationally prohibitive for most learning algorithms, but possible in RF since each tree maximizes the objective in a coordinate-wise fashion. Computational complexity of the listwise approach is higher than the pointwise counterpart; hence for larger datasets, we design a hybrid algorithm that combines a listwise objective in the early stages of tree construction and a pointwise objective in the latter stages. We also study the effect of the discount function of NDCG on the listwise algorithm.Experimental results on several publicly available LtR datasets reveal that the listwise/hybrid algorithm outperforms the pointwise approach on the majority (but not all) of the datasets. We then investigate several aspects of the two algorithms to better understand the inevitable performance tradeoffs. The aspects include examining an RF-based unsupervised LtR algorithm and comparing individual tree strength. Finally, we compare the the investigated RF-based algorithms with several other LtR algorithms.},

Our motivation builds on the assumption that human interpretation should lead to the most accurate assessment of sentiment in text. We call this automated process Human Reading for Sentiment (HRS). Previous research in sentiment analysis has produced many frameworks that can fit one or more of the HRS aspects; however, none of these methods has addressed them all in one approach. HRS provides a meta-framework for developing new sentiment analysis methods or improving existing ones. The proposed framework provides a theoretical lens for zooming in and evaluating aspects of any sentiment analysis method to identify gaps for improvements towards matching the human reading process. Key steps in HRS include the automation of humans low-level and high-level cognitive text processing. This methodology paves the way towards the integration of psychology with computational linguistics and machine learning to employ models of pragmatics and discourse analysis for sentiment analysis. HRS is tested with two state-of-the-art methods; one is based on feature engineering, and the other is based on deep learning. HRS highlighted the gaps in both methods and showed improvements for both.},

abstract = {Technology progress is one of the key reasons behind today's rapid changes in lifestyles. Knowing how products and objects evolve can not only help with understanding the evolutionary patterns in our society but can also provide clues on effective product design and can offer support for predicting the future. We propose a general framework for analyzing technology's impact on our lives through detecting cause--effect relationships, where causes represent changes in technology while effects are changes in social life, such as new activities or new ways of using products. We address the challenge of viewing technology evolution through the “social impact lens” by mining causal relationships from the long-term collections of product reviews. In particular, we first propose dividing vocabulary into two groups: terms describing product features (called physical terms) and terms representing product usage (called conceptual terms). We then search for two kinds of changes related to the appearance of terms: frequency-based and context-based changes. The former indicate periods when a word was significantly more frequently used, whereas the latter indicate periods of high change in the word's context. Based on the detected changes, we then search for causal term pairs such that the change in the physical term triggers the change in the conceptual term. We next extend our approach to finding causal relationships between word groups such as a group of words representing the same technology and causing a given conceptual change or group of words representing two different technologies that simultaneously “co-cause” a conceptual change. We conduct experiments on different product types using the Amazon Product Review Dataset, which spans 1995 to 2013, and we demonstrate that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art baselines.},

These lists serve as reference to the result list at hand, the effectiveness of which we want to predict. We show that many previously proposed prediction methods can be explained using our framework. More generally, we shed new light on existing prediction methods and establish formal common grounds to seemingly different prediction approaches. In addition, we formally demonstrate the connection between prediction using reference lists and fusion of retrieved lists, and provide empirical support to this connection.

abstract = {Query auto-completion assists web search users in formulating queries with a few keystrokes, helping them to avoid spelling mistakes and to produce clear query expressions, and so on. Previous work on query auto-completion mainly centers around returning a list of completions to users, aiming to push queries that are most likely intended by the user to the top positions but ignoring the redundancy among the query candidates in the list. Thus, semantically related queries matching the input prefix are often returned together. This may push valuable suggestions out of the list, given that only a limited number of candidates can be shown to the user, which may result in a less than optimal search experience.In this article, we consider the task of diversifying query auto-completion, which aims to return the correct query completions early in a ranked list of candidate completions and at the same time reduce the redundancy among query auto-completion candidates. We develop a greedy query selection approach that predicts query completions based on the current search popularity of candidate completions and on the aspects of previous queries in the same search session. The popularity of completion candidates at query time can be directly aggregated from query logs. However, query aspects are implicitly expressed by previous clicked documents in the search context. To determine the query aspect, we categorize clicked documents of a query using a hierarchy based on the open directory project. Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization is applied to derive the distribution of queries over all aspects. We quantify the improvement of our greedy query selection model against a state-of-the-art baseline using two large-scale, real-world query logs and show that it beats the baseline in terms of well-known metrics used in query auto-completion and diversification. In addition, we conduct a side-by-side experiment to verify the effectiveness of our proposal.},

abstract = {The evolution potential estimation of news events can support the decision making of both corporations and governments. For example, a corporation could manage its public relations crisis in a timely manner if a negative news event about this corporation is known with large evolution potential in advance. However, existing state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on time series historical data, which are not suitable for the news events with limited historical data and bursty properties. In this article, we propose a purely content-based method to estimate the evolution potential of the news events. The proposed method considers a news event at a given time point as a system composed of different keywords, and the uncertainty of this system is defined and measured as the Semantic Uncertainty of this news event. At the same time, an uncertainty space is constructed with two extreme states: the most uncertain state and the most certain state. We believe that the Semantic Uncertainty has correlation with the content evolution of the news events, so it can be used to estimate the evolution potential of the news events. In order to verify the proposed method, we present detailed experimental setups and results measuring the correlation of the Semantic Uncertainty with the Content Change of news events using collected news events data. The results show that the correlation does exist and is stronger than the correlation of value from the time-series-based method with the Content Change. Therefore, we can use the Semantic Uncertainty to estimate the evolution potential of news events.},

Sometimes strong baselines are made worse when a new technique is applied. We investigate whether conducting comparisons against a range of weaker baselines can increase confidence that an observed effect will also show improvements on a stronger baseline. Our results indicate that this is not the case -- at best, testing against a range of baselines means that an experimenter can be more confident that the new technique is unlikely to significantly harm a strong baseline. Examining recent past work, we present evidence that the information retrieval (IR) community continues to test against weak baselines. This is unfortunate as, in light of our experiments, we conclude that the only way to be confident that a new technique is a contribution is to compare it against nothing less than the state of the art.},

A key tenet of personalization is the capacity to model user preferences. Most of the previous work on recommendation and personalization has focused primarily on individual preferences. While some focus on shared preferences between pairs of users, they assume that the same similarity value applies to all items. Here we investigate the notion of “context,” hypothesizing that while two users may agree on their preferences on some items, they may also disagree on other items. To model this, we design probabilistic models for the generation of rating differences between pairs of users across different items. Since this model also involves the estimation of rating differences on unseen items for the purpose of prediction, we further conduct a systematic analysis of matrix factorization and tensor factorization methods in this estimation, and propose a factorization model with a novel objective function of minimizing error in rating differences. Experiments on several real-life rating datasets show that our proposed model consistently yields context-specific similarity values that perform better on a prediction task than models relying on shared preferences.},

In this article, we investigate the properties of trust propagation within social networks, based on the notion of transitivity, and we introduce the TISoN model to generate and evaluate Trust Inference within online Social Networks. To do so, (i) we develop a novel TPS algorithm for Trust Path Searching where we define neighbours’ priority based on their direct trust degrees, and then select trusted paths while controlling the path length; and, (ii) we develop different TIM algorithms for Trust Inference Measuring and build a trust network. In addition, we analyse existing algorithms and we demonstrate that our proposed model better computes transitive trust values than do the existing models. We conduct extensive experiments on a real online social network dataset, Advogato.

Whilst this produces undoubted societal benefits, the ability for content to be spontaneously posted and reposted creates an ideal environment for rumour and false/malicious information to spread rapidly. When this occurs it can cause significant harm and can be characterised as a “digital wildfire.” In this article, we demonstrate that the propagation and regulation of digital wildfires form important topics for research and conduct an overview of existing work in this area. We outline the relevance of a range of work from the computational and social sciences, including a series of insights into the propagation of rumour and false/malicious information. We argue that significant research gaps remain—for instance, there is an absence of systematic studies on the effects of digital wildfires and there is a need to combine empirical research with a consideration of how the responsible governance of social media can be determined. We propose an agenda for research that establishes a methodology to explore in full the propagation and regulation of unverified content on social media.

abstract = {Interpersonal ties are responsible for the structure of social networks and the transmission of information through these networks. Different types of social ties have essentially different influences on people. Awareness of the types of social ties can benefit many applications, such as recommendation and community detection. For example, our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, while our classmates may be distributed into different communities. Though a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of predicting social ties across multiple heterogeneous networks.In this work, we develop a framework referred to as TranFG for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of predicting the types of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. We also present several active learning strategies to further enhance the inferring performance. To scale up the model to handle really large networks, we design a distributed learning algorithm for the proposed model.We evaluate the proposed framework (TranFG) on six different networks and compare with several existing methods. TranFG clearly outperforms the existing methods on multiple metrics. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, TranFG is able to obtain an F1-score of 90% (8%--28% improvements over alternative methods) for predicting manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network. The proposed model is efficient. It takes only a few minutes to train the proposed transfer model on large networks containing tens of thousands of nodes.},

abstract = {Online social networks have become an effective and important social platform for communication, opinions exchange, and information sharing. However, they also make it possible for rapid and wide misinformation diffusion, which may lead to pernicious influences on individuals or society. Hence, it is extremely important and necessary to detect the misinformation propagation by placing monitors.In this article, we first define a general misinformation-detection problem for the case where the knowledge about misinformation sources is lacking, and show its equivalence to the influence-maximization problem in the reverse graph. Furthermore, considering node vulnerability, we aim to detect the misinformation reaching to a specific user. Therefore, we study a τ-Monitor Placement problem for cases where partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available and prove its #P complexity. We formulate a corresponding integer program, tackle exponential constraints, and propose a Minimum Monitor Set Construction (MMSC) algorithm, in which the cut-set2 has been exploited in the estimation of reachability of node pairs. Moreover, we generalize the problem from a single target to multiple central nodes and propose another algorithm based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms with respect to minimizing the number of monitors.},

Breaking news has tight reporting deadlines, measured in minutes not days, but content must still be checked and rumors verified. As such, journalists are looking at automated content analysis to prefilter large volumes of social media content prior to manual verification. This article describes a real-time social media analytics framework for journalists. We extend our previously published geoparsing approach to improve its scalability and efficiency. We develop and evaluate a novel approach to geosemantic feature extraction, classifying evidence in terms of situatedness, timeliness, confirmation, and validity. Our approach works for new unseen news topics. We report results from four experiments using five Twitter datasets crawled during different English-language news events. One of our datasets is the standard TREC 2012 microblog corpus. Our classification results are promising, with F1 scores varying by class from 0.64 to 0.92 for unseen event types. We lastly report results from two case studies during real-world news stories, showcasing different ways our system can assist journalists filter and cross-check content as they examine the trust and veracity of content and sources.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in mobile devices and cloud-based music service now allow consumers to enjoy music anytime and anywhere. Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is user’s venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the user’s music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems.},

This common assumption aims to focus on specific characteristics of the empirical probability distribution of such data (e.g., its scale-free nature or its long/fat tail). This assumption, however, may not be always true. Motivated by recent work in the statistical treatment of power law claims, we investigate two research questions: (i) To what extent do power law approximations hold for term frequency, document length, query frequency, query length, citation frequency, and syntactic unigram frequency? And (ii) what is the computational cost of replacing ad hoc power law approximations with more accurate distribution fitting? We study 23 TREC and 5 non-TREC datasets and compare the fit of power laws to 15 other standard probability distributions. We find that query frequency and 5 out of 24 term frequency distributions are best approximated by a power law. All remaining properties are better approximated by the Inverse Gaussian, Generalized Extreme Value, Negative Binomial, or Yule distribution. We also find the overhead of replacing power law approximations by more informed distribution fitting to be negligible, with potential gains to IR tasks like index compression or test collection generation for IR evaluation.},

abstract = {In electricity customer classification, the most important task is to avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, as the consumption diagrams have a large number of dimensions. To avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, field indices (load shape factor) are often used instead of consumption diagrams. Field indices are directly extracted from consumption diagrams according to a predefined formula. Previous studies show that the most important thing for defining such a formula is to find meaningful time intervals from consumption diagrams. However, the inconvenient thing is that there are still a lack of details to explain how to define such time intervals.In our study, we propose a data mining--based method named SFATIE to support the extraction of field indices. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with other dimensionality reduction methods during the classification. For the classification, most often we have used classification methods like C5.0, SVM, Neural Net, Bayes Net, and Logistic. The experimental results show that our method is better or close to other dimensionality reduction methods. In addition, the experimental results show that our proposed method can produce the good quality of field indices and that these indices can improve the performance of electricity customer classification.},

We maintain that capturing the intrinsic relations among multiple information sources is important for predicting stock trends. The challenge lies in modeling the complex space of various sources and types of information and studying the effects of this information on stock market behavior. For this purpose, we introduce a tensor-based information framework to predict stock movements. Specifically, our framework models the complex investor information environment with tensors. A global dimensionality-reduction algorithm is used to capture the links among various information sources in a tensor, and a sequence of tensors is used to represent information gathered over time. Finally, a tensor-based predictive model to forecast stock movements, which is in essence a high-order tensor regression learning problem, is presented. Experiments performed on an entire year of data for China Securities Index stocks demonstrate that a trading system based on our framework outperforms the classic Top-N trading strategy and two state-of-the-art media-aware trading algorithms.},

abstract = {If a piece of information is released from a set of media sites, can it spread, in 1 month, to a million web pages? Can we efficiently find a small set of media sites among millions that can maximize the spread of the information, in 1 month? The two problems are called influence estimation and maximization problems respectively, which are very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problems and the issue of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this article, we propose two algorithms for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. The first one uses continuous-time Markov chains to estimate influence exactly on networks with exponential, or, more generally, phase-type transmission functions, but does not scale to large-scale networks, and the second one is a highly efficient randomized algorithm, which estimates the influence of every node in a network with general transmission functions, |ν| nodes and |ε| edges to an accuracy of ϵ using n = O(1/ϵ2) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|ε|+n|ν| computations. We then show that finding the set of most influential source nodes in a continuous time diffusion network is an NP-hard problem and develop an efficient greedy algorithm with provable near-optimal performance. When used as subroutines in the influence maximization algorithm, the exact influence estimation algorithm is guaranteed to find a set of C nodes with an influence of at least (1 − 1/e)OPT and the randomized algorithm is guaranteed to find a set with an influence of at least 1 − 1/e)OPT − 2Cε, where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes to maximize the influence, and the randomized algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes.},

Such systems are based on IR models, which define how to represent the documents and the query, as well as how to determine the relevance of a document for a query. In this article, we present a new IR model based on concepts taken from both IR and digital signal processing (like Fourier analysis of signals and filtering). This allows the whole IR process to be seen as a physical phenomenon, where the query corresponds to a signal, the documents correspond to filters, and the determination of the relevant documents to the query is done by filtering that signal. Tests showed that the quality of the results provided by this IR model is comparable with the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Multidocument summarization addresses the selection of a compact subset of highly informative sentences, i.e., the summary, from a collection of textual documents. To perform sentence selection, two parallel strategies have been proposed: (a) apply general-purpose techniques relying on data mining or information retrieval techniques, and/or (b) perform advanced linguistic analysis relying on semantics-based models (e.g., ontologies) to capture the actual sentence meaning. Since there is an increasing need for processing documents written in different languages, the attention of the research community has recently focused on summarizers based on strategy (a).This article presents a novel multilingual summarizer, namely MWI-Sum (Multilingual Weighted Itemset-based Summarizer), that exploits an itemset-based model to summarize collections of documents ranging over the same topic. Unlike previous approaches, it extracts frequent weighted itemsets tailored to the analyzed collection and uses them to drive the sentence selection process. Weighted itemsets represent correlations among multiple highly relevant terms that are neglected by previous approaches. The proposed approach makes minimal use of language-dependent analyses. Thus, it is easily applicable to document collections written in different languages.Experiments performed on benchmark and real-life collections, English-written and not, demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than state-of-the-art multilingual document summarizers.},

Most recent efforts have proposed several efficient methods to learn word embeddings from context such that they can encode both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. However, it is quite challenging to handle unseen or rare words with insufficient context. Inspired by the study on the word recognition process in cognitive psychology, in this article, we propose to take advantage of seemingly less obvious but essentially important morphological knowledge to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that leverages both words’ contextual information and morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, this new learning architecture is also able to benefit from noisy knowledge and balance between contextual information and morphological knowledge. Experiments on an analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task both demonstrate that the proposed KNET framework can greatly enhance the effectiveness of word embeddings.},

In contrast, this article presents our study of the social emotion detection problem, the objective of which is to identify the evoked emotions of readers by online documents such as news articles. A novel Latent Discriminative Model (LDM) is proposed for this task. LDM works by introducing intermediate hidden variables to model the latent structure of input text corpora. To achieve this, it defines a joint distribution over emotions and latent variables, conditioned on the observed text documents. Moreover, we assume that social emotions are not independent but correlated with one another, and the dependency of them is capable of providing additional guidance to LDM in the training process. The inclusion of this emotional dependency into LDM gives rise to a new Emotional Dependency-based LDM (eLDM). We evaluate the proposed models through a series of empirical evaluations on two real-world corpora of news articles. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of LDM and eLDM in social emotion detection.},

Usually, the textual units are simply represented as sentences or n-grams, which do not carry deep syntactic and semantic information. This article presents a novel extractive topic-focused multidocument summarization framework. The framework proposes a new kind of more meaningful and informative units named frequent Deep Dependency Sub-Structure (DDSS) and a topic-sensitive Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model for frequent DDSS ranking. Given a document set, first, we parse all the sentences into deep dependency structures with a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parser and mine the frequent DDSSs after semantic normalization. Then we employ a topic-sensitive MTL model to learn the importance of these frequent DDSSs. Finally, we exploit an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation and use the frequent DDSSs as the essentials for summary extraction. Experimental results on two DUC datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Both the DDSS information and the topic-sensitive MTL model are validated to be very helpful for topic-focused multidocument summarization.},

Session search is one such IR task—document retrieval within a session. During a session, a user constantly modifies queries to find documents that fulfill an information need. Existing IR techniques for assisting the user in this task are limited in their ability to optimize over changes, learn with a minimal computational footprint, and be responsive. This article proposes a novel query change retrieval model (QCM), which uses syntactic editing changes between consecutive queries, as well as the relationship between query changes and previously retrieved documents, to enhance session search. We propose modeling session search as a Markov decision process (MDP). We consider two agents in this MDP: the user agent and the search engine agent. The user agent’s actions are query changes that we observe, and the search engine agent’s actions are term weight adjustments as proposed in this work. We also investigate multiple query aggregation schemes and their effectiveness on session search. Experiments show that our approach is highly effective and outperforms top session search systems in TREC 2011 and TREC 2012.},

abstract = {The inverted index is the dominant indexing method in information retrieval systems. It enables fast return of the list of all documents containing a given query term. However, for retrieval schemes involving query expansion, as in pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), the retrieval time based on an inverted index increases linearly with the number of expansion terms. In this regard, we have examined the use of a forward index, which consists of the mapping of each document to its constituent terms. We propose a novel forward index-based reranking scheme to shorten the PRF retrieval time. In our method, a first retrieval of the original query is performed using an inverted index, and then a forward index is employed for the PRF part. We have studied several new forward indexes, including using a novel spstring data structure and the weighted variable bit-block compression (wvbc) signature. With modern hardware such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and sufficiently large main memory, forward index methods are particularly promising. We find that with the whole index stored in main memory, PRF retrieval using a spstring or wvbc forward index excels in time efficiency over an inverted index, being able to obtain the same levels of performance measures at shorter times.},

abstract = {The multinomial language model has been one of the most effective models of retrieval for more than a decade. However, the multinomial distribution does not model one important linguistic phenomenon relating to term dependency—that is, the tendency of a term to repeat itself within a document (i.e., word burstiness). In this article, we model document generation as a random process with reinforcement (a multivariate P\'{o}lya process) and develop a Dirichlet compound multinomial language model that captures word burstiness directly.We show that the new reinforced language model can be computed as efficiently as current retrieval models, and with experiments on an extensive set of TREC collections, we show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art language model for a number of standard effectiveness metrics. Experiments also show that the tuning parameter in the proposed model is more robust than that in the multinomial language model. Furthermore, we develop a constraint for the verbosity hypothesis and show that the proposed model adheres to the constraint. Finally, we show that the new language model essentially introduces a measure closely related to idf, which gives theoretical justification for combining the term and document event spaces in tf-idf type schemes.},

While experiencing complex information needs that require multiple search sessions, users may utilize desktop computers to fulfill information needs started on mobile devices. Under the context of mobile-to-desktop web search, this article analyzes users’ behavioral patterns and compares them to the patterns in desktop-to-desktop web search. Then, we examine several approaches of using Mobile Touch Interactions (MTIs) to infer relevant content so that such content can be used for supporting subsequent search queries on desktop computers. The experimental data used in this article was collected through a user study involving 24 participants and six properly designed cross-device web search tasks. Our experimental results show that (1) users’ mobile-to-desktop search behaviors do significantly differ from desktop-to-desktop search behaviors in terms of information exploration, sense-making and repeated behaviors. (2) MTIs can be employed to predict the relevance of click-through documents, but applying document-level relevant content based on the predicted relevance does not improve search performance. (3) MTIs can also be used to identify the relevant text chunks at a fine-grained subdocument level. Such relevant information can achieve better search performance than the document-level relevant content. In addition, such subdocument relevant information can be combined with document-level relevance to further improve the search performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies on the sufficiency of click-through documents. (4) MTIs can also be obtained from the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The subdocument feedbacks inferred from this set of MTIs even outperform the MTI-based subdocument feedback from the click-through documents.},

The search cost and the computational requirements of this approach are often prohibitively high for organizations with few computational resources. This article investigates and extends an alternative: selective search, an approach that partitions the dataset based on document similarity to obtain topic-based shards, and searches only a few shards that are estimated to contain relevant documents for the query. We propose shard creation techniques that are scalable, efficient, self-reliant, and create topic-based shards with low variance in size, and high density of relevant documents.The experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness of selective search is on par with that of exhaustive search, and the corresponding search costs are substantially lower with the former. Also, the majority of the queries perform as well or better with selective search. An oracle experiment that uses optimal shard ranking for a query indicates that selective search can outperform the effectiveness of exhaustive search. Comparison with a query optimization technique shows higher improvements in efficiency with selective search. The overall best efficiency is achieved when the two techniques are combined in an optimized selective search approach.},

abstract = {Evaluation is central in research and development of information retrieval (IR). In addition to designing and implementing new retrieval mechanisms, one must also show through rigorous evaluation that they are effective. A major focus in IR is IR mechanisms’ capability of ranking relevant documents optimally for the users, given a query. Searching for information in practice involves searchers, however, and is highly interactive. When human searchers have been incorporated in evaluation studies, the results have often suggested that better ranking does not necessarily lead to better search task, or work task, performance. Therefore, it is not clear which system or interface features should be developed to improve the effectiveness of human task performance. In the present article, we focus on the evaluation of task-based information interaction (TBII). We give special emphasis to learning tasks to discuss TBII in more concrete terms. Information interaction is here understood as behavioral and cognitive activities related to task planning, searching information items, selecting between them, working with them, and synthesizing and reporting. These five generic activities contribute to task performance and outcome and can be supported by information systems. In an attempt toward task-based evaluation, we introduce program theory as the evaluation framework. Such evaluation can investigate whether a program consisting of TBII activities and tools works and how it works and, further, provides a causal description of program (in)effectiveness. Our goal in the present article is to structure TBII on the basis of the five generic activities and consider the evaluation of each activity using the program theory framework. Finally, we combine these activity-based program theories in an overall evaluation framework for TBII. Such an evaluation is complex due to the large number of factors affecting information interaction. Instead of presenting tested program theories, we illustrate how the evaluation of TBII should be accomplished using the program theory framework in the evaluation of systems and behaviors, and their interactions, comprehensively in context.},

abstract = {Personalization of support for information seeking depends crucially on the information retrieval system's knowledge of the task that led the person to engage in information seeking. Users work during information search sessions to satisfy their task goals, and their activity is not random. To what degree are there patterns in the user activity during information search sessions? Do activity patterns reflect the user's situation as the user moves through the search task under the influence of his or her task goal? Do these patterns reflect aspects of different types of information-seeking tasks? Could such activity patterns identify contexts within which information seeking takes place? To investigate these questions, we model sequences of user behaviors in two independent user studies of information search sessions (N = 32 users, 128 sessions, and N = 40 users, 160 sessions). Two representations of user activity patterns are used. One is based on the sequences of page use; the other is based on a cognitive representation of information acquisition derived from eye movement patterns in service of the reading process. One of the user studies considered journalism work tasks; the other concerned background research in genomics using search tasks taken from the TREC Genomics Track. The search tasks differed in basic dimensions of complexity, specificity, and the type of information product (intellectual or factual) needed to achieve the overall task goal. The results show that similar patterns of user activity are observed at both the cognitive and page use levels. The activity patterns at both representation layers are able to distinguish between task types in similar ways and, to some degree, between tasks of different levels of difficulty. We explore relationships between the results and task difficulty and discuss the use of activity patterns to explore events within a search session. User activity patterns can be at least partially observed in server-side search logs. A focus on patterns of user activity sequences may contribute to the development of information systems that better personalize the user's search experience.},

abstract = {An online community consists of a group of users who share a common interest, background, or experience, and their collective goal is to contribute toward the welfare of the community members. Several websites allow their users to create and manage niche communities, such as Yahoo! Groups, Facebook Groups, Google+ Circles, and WebMD Forums. These community services also exist within enterprises, such as IBM Connections. Question answering within these communities enables their members to exchange knowledge and information with other community members. However, the onus of finding the right community for question asking lies with an individual user. The overwhelming number of communities necessitates the need for a good question routing strategy so that new questions get routed to an appropriately focused community and thus get resolved in a reasonable time frame.In this article, we consider the novel problem of routing a question to the right community and propose a framework for selecting and ranking the relevant communities for a question. We propose several novel features for modeling the three main entities of the system: questions, users, and communities. We propose features such as language attributes, inclination to respond, user familiarity, and difficulty of a question; based on these features, we propose similarity metrics between the routed question and the system entities. We introduce a Cutoff-Aggregation (CA) algorithm that aggregates the entity similarity within a community to compute that community's relevance. We introduce two k-nearest-neighbor (knn) algorithms that are a natural instantiation of the CA algorithm, which are computationally efficient and evaluate several ranking algorithms over the aggregate similarity scores computed by the two knn algorithms. We propose clustering techniques to speed up our recommendation framework and show how pipelining can improve the model performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two large real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Social media provides valuable resources to analyze user behaviors and capture user preferences. This article focuses on analyzing user behaviors in social media systems and designing a latent class statistical mixture model, named temporal context-aware mixture model (TCAM), to account for the intentions and preferences behind user behaviors. Based on the observation that the behaviors of a user in social media systems are generally influenced by intrinsic interest as well as the temporal context (e.g., the public's attention at that time), TCAM simultaneously models the topics related to users' intrinsic interests and the topics related to temporal context and then combines the influences from the two factors to model user behaviors in a unified way. Considering that users' interests are not always stable and may change over time, we extend TCAM to a dynamic temporal context-aware mixture model (DTCAM) to capture users' changing interests. To alleviate the problem of data sparsity, we exploit the social and temporal correlation information by integrating a social-temporal regularization framework into the DTCAM model. To further improve the performance of our proposed models (TCAM and DTCAM), an item-weighting scheme is proposed to enable them to favor items that better represent topics related to user interests and topics related to temporal context, respectively. Based on our proposed models, we design a temporal context-aware recommender system (TCARS). To speed up the process of producing the top-k recommendations from large-scale social media data, we develop an efficient query-processing technique to support TCARS. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our models on four real-world datasets crawled from different social media sites. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our models, compared with the state-of-the-art competitor methods, by modeling user behaviors more precisely and making more effective and efficient recommendations.},

We study our algorithms through the lens of stochastic analysis and prove that even though they use only a small fraction of the entire collection, they can provide answers to most user queries, achieving a performance close to the optimal. To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally show the versatility of our approach by considering two important cases in the context of Web search. In the first case, we favor the retrieval of documents that are relevant to the query, whereas in the second case we aim for document diversification. Both the theoretical and the experimental analysis provide strong evidence of the potential value of query covering in diverse application scenarios.},

However, it does not distinguish the verbosity from the scope, these being the two main factors determining the document length. Because the verbosity and scope have largely different effects on the increase in term frequency, the standard approach can easily suffer from insufficient or excessive penalization depending on the specific type of long document. To overcome these problems, this article proposes two-stage normalization by performing verbosity and scope normalization separately, and by employing different penalization functions. In verbosity normalization, each document is prenormalized by dividing the term frequency by the verbosity of the document. In scope normalization, an existing retrieval model is applied in a straightforward manner to the prenormalized document, finally leading us to formulate our proposed verbosity normalized (VN) retrieval model. Experimental results carried out on standard TREC collections demonstrate that the VN model leads to marginal but statistically significant improvements over standard retrieval models.},

abstract = {Micro-blogging services and location-based social networks, such as Twitter, Weibo, and Foursquare, enable users to post short messages with timestamps and geographical annotations. The rich spatial-temporal-semantic information of individuals embedded in these geo-annotated short messages provides exciting opportunity to develop many context-aware applications in ubiquitous computing environments. Example applications include contextual recommendation and contextual search. To obtain accurate recommendations and most relevant search results, it is important to capture users’ contextual information (e.g., time and location) and to understand users’ topical interests and intentions. While time and location can be readily captured by smartphones, understanding user’s interests and intentions calls for effective methods in modeling user mobility behavior. Here, user mobility refers to who visits which place at what time for what activity. That is, user mobility behavior modeling must consider user (Who), spatial (Where), temporal (When), and activity (What) aspects. Unfortunately, no previous studies on user mobility behavior modeling have considered all of the four aspects jointly, which have complex interdependencies. In our preliminary study, we propose the first solution named W4 (short for Who, Where, When, and What) to discover user mobility behavior from the four aspects. In this article, we further enhance W4 and propose a nonparametric Bayesian model named EW4 (short for Enhanced W4). EW4 requires no parameter tuning and achieves better results over W4 in our experiments. Given some of the four aspects of a user (e.g., time), our model is able to infer information of the other aspects (e.g., location and topical words). Thus, our model has a variety of context-aware applications, particularly in contextual search and recommendation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed model is effective in discovering users’ spatial-temporal topics. The model also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for various tasks including location prediction for tweets and requirement-aware location recommendation.},

abstract = {An important way to improve users’ satisfaction in Web search is to assist them by issuing more effective queries. One such approach is query reformulation, which generates new queries according to the current query issued by users. A common procedure for conducting reformulation is to generate some candidate queries first, then a scoring method is employed to assess these candidates. Currently, most of the existing methods are context based. They rely heavily on the context relation of terms in the history queries and cannot detect and maintain the semantic consistency of queries. In this article, we propose a graphical model to score queries. The proposed model exploits a latent topic space, which is automatically derived from the query log, to detect semantic dependency of terms in a query and dependency among topics. Meanwhile, the graphical model also captures the term context in the history query by skip-bigram and n-gram language models. In addition, our model can be easily extended to consider users’ history search interests when we conduct query reformulation for different users. In the task of candidate query generation, we investigate a social tagging data resource—Delicious bookmark—to generate addition and substitution patterns that are employed as supplements to the patterns generated from query log data.},

abstract = {How to precisely and efficiently detect near-duplicate copies with complicated audiovisual transformations from a large-scale video database is a challenging task. To cope with this challenge, this article proposes a transformation-aware soft cascading (TASC) approach for multimodal video copy detection. Basically, our approach divides query videos into some categories and then for each category designs a transformation-aware chain to organize several detectors in a cascade structure. In each chain, efficient but simple detectors are placed in the forepart, whereas effective but complex detectors are located in the rear. To judge whether two videos are near-duplicates, a Detection-on-Copy-Units mechanism is introduced in the TASC, which makes the decision of copy detection depending on the similarity between their most similar fractions, called copy units (CUs), rather than the video-level similarity. Following this, we propose a CU search algorithm to find a pair of CUs from two videos and a CU-based localization algorithm to find the precise locations of their copy segments that are with the asserted CUs as the center. Moreover, to address the problem that the copies and noncopies are possibly linearly inseparable in the feature space, the TASC also introduces a flexible strategy, called soft decision boundary, to replace the single threshold strategy for each detector. Its basic idea is to automatically learn two thresholds for each detector to examine the easy-to-judge copies and noncopies, respectively, and meanwhile to train a nonlinear classifier to further check those hard-to-judge ones. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that the TASC can achieve excellent copy detection accuracy and localization precision with a very high processing efficiency.},

abstract = {Information systems that utilise contextual information have the potential of helping a user identify relevant information more quickly and more accurately than systems that work the same for all users and contexts. Contextual information comes in a variety of types, often derived from records of past interactions between a user and the information system. It can be individual or group based. We are focusing on the latter, harnessing the search behaviour of cohorts of users, turning it into a domain model that can then be used to assist other users of the same cohort. More specifically, we aim to explore how such a domain model is best utilised for profile-biased summarisation of documents in a navigation scenario in which such summaries can be displayed as hover text as a user moves the mouse over a link. The main motivation is to help a user find relevant documents more quickly. Given the fact that the Web in general has been studied extensively already, we focus our attention on Web sites and similar document collections. Such collections can be notoriously difficult to search or explore. The process of acquiring the domain model is not a research interest here; we simply adopt a biologically inspired method that resembles the idea of ant colony optimisation. This has been shown to work well in a variety of application areas. The model can be built in a continuous learning cycle that exploits search patterns as recorded in typical query log files. Our research explores different summarisation techniques, some of which use the domain model and some that do not. We perform task-based evaluations of these different techniques—thus of the impact of the domain model and profile-biased summarisation—in the context of Web site navigation.},

abstract = {A result page of a modern search engine often goes beyond a simple list of “10 blue links.” Many specific user needs (e.g., News, Image, Video) are addressed by so-called aggregated or vertical search solutions: specially presented documents, often retrieved from specific sources, that stand out from the regular organic Web search results. When it comes to evaluating ranking systems, such complex result layouts raise their own challenges. This is especially true for so-called interleaving methods that have arisen as an important type of online evaluation: by mixing results from two different result pages, interleaving can easily break the desired Web layout in which vertical documents are grouped together, and hence hurt the user experience.We conduct an analysis of different interleaving methods as applied to aggregated search engine result pages. Apart from conventional interleaving methods, we propose two vertical-aware methods: one derived from the widely used Team-Draft Interleaving method by adjusting it in such a way that it respects vertical document groupings, and another based on the recently introduced Optimized Interleaving framework. We show that our proposed methods are better at preserving the user experience than existing interleaving methods while still performing well as a tool for comparing ranking systems. For evaluating our proposed vertical-aware interleaving methods, we use real-world click data as well as simulated clicks and simulated ranking systems.},

Existing caching techniques for search engine optimization are mostly biased towards the reduction of random accesses to disks, because random accesses are known to be much more expensive than sequential accesses in traditional magnetic hard disk drive (HDD). Recently, solid-state drive (SSD) has emerged as a new kind of secondary storage medium, and some search engines like Baidu have already used SSD to completely replace HDD in their infrastructure. One notable property of SSD is that its random access latency is comparable to its sequential access latency. Therefore, the use of SSDs to replace HDDs in a search engine infrastructure may void the cache management of existing search engines. In this article, we carry out a series of empirical experiments to study the impact of SSD on search engine cache management. Based on the results, we give insights to practitioners and researchers on how to adapt the infrastructure and caching policies for SSD-based search engines.},

Fortunately, other relevance evidence sources (i.e., classification tags and bibliographical data) provide additional details about the underlying information need. In this article, we propose a unified framework that integrates multiple relevance evidence components for query formulation. We first build a query model from the textual fields of a query patent. To overcome the term mismatch, we expand this initial query model with the term distribution of documents in the citation graph, modeling old and recent domain terminology. We build an IPC lexicon and perform query expansion using this lexicon incorporating proximity information. We performed an empirical evaluation on two patent datasets. Our results show that employing the temporal features of documents has a precision enhancing effect, while query expansion using IPC lexicon improves the recall of the final rank list.},

We tackle two core issues that are central to query translation: how to exploit context to generate more accurate translations and how to preserve ambiguity that may be present in the original query, thereby retaining a diverse set of translation alternatives. These two considerations are often in tension since ambiguity in natural language is typically resolved by exploiting context, but effective retrieval requires striking the right balance. We propose two novel query translation approaches: the grammar-based approach extracts translation probabilities from translation grammars, while the decoder-based approach takes advantage of n-best translation hypotheses. Both are context-sensitive, in contrast to a baseline context-insensitive approach that uses bilingual dictionaries for word-by-word translation. Experimental results show that by “opening up” modern statistical machine translation systems, we can access intermediate representations that yield high retrieval effectiveness. By combining evidence from multiple sources, we demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines on standard cross-language information retrieval test collections. In addition to effectiveness, the efficiency of our techniques are explored as well.},

abstract = {With the advent of online social networks, recommender systems have became crucial for the success of many online applications/services due to their significance role in tailoring these applications to user-specific needs or preferences. Despite their increasing popularity, in general, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity and cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with the rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting trust information in the recommendation process stems from the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user communities, in addition to trust relations, distrust relations also exist between users. For instance, in Epinions, the concepts of personal “web of trust” and personal “block list” allow users to categorize their friends based on the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. Hence, it will be interesting to incorporate this new source of information in recommendation as well. In contrast to the incorporation of trust information in recommendation which is thriving, the potential of explicitly incorporating distrust relations is almost unexplored. In this article, we propose a matrix factorization-based model for recommendation in social rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust relationships aiming to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the Epinions dataset, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard trust-enhanced or distrust-enhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy, thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit distrust information can have on recommender systems.},

abstract = {With the development of image search technology, users are no longer satisfied with searching for images using just metadata and textual descriptions. Instead, more search demands are focused on retrieving images based on similarities in their contents (textures, colors, shapes etc.). Nevertheless, one image may deliver rich or complex content and multiple interests. Sometimes users do not sufficiently define or describe their seeking demands for images even when general search interests appear, owing to a lack of specific knowledge to express their intents. A new form of information seeking activity, referred to as exploratory search, is emerging in the research community, which generally combines browsing and searching content together to help users gain additional knowledge and form accurate queries, thereby assisting the users with their seeking and investigation activities. However, there have been few attempts at addressing integrated exploratory search solutions when image browsing is incorporated into the exploring loop. In this work, we investigate the challenges of understanding users' search interests from the images being browsed and infer their actual search intentions. We develop a novel system to explore an effective and efficient way for allowing users to seamlessly switch between browse and search processes, and naturally complete visual-based exploratory search tasks. The system, called Browse-to-Search enables users to specify their visual search interests by circling any visual objects in the webpages being browsed, and then the system automatically forms the visual entities to represent users' underlying intent. One visual entity is not limited by the original image content, but also encapsulated by the textual-based browsing context and the associated heterogeneous attributes. We use large-scale image search technology to find the associated textual attributes from the repository. Users can then utilize the encapsulated visual entities to complete search tasks. The Browse-to-Search system is one of the first attempts to integrate browse and search activities for a visual-based exploratory search, which is characterized by four unique properties: (1) in session—searching is performed during browsing session and search results naturally accompany with browsing content; (2) in context—the pages being browsed provide text-based contextual cues for searching; (3) in focus—users can focus on the visual content of interest without worrying about the difficulties of query formulation, and visual entities will be automatically formed; and (4) intuitiveness—a touch and visual search-based user interface provides a natural user experience. We deploy the Browse-to-Search system on tablet devices and evaluate the system performance using millions of images. We demonstrate that it is effective and efficient in facilitating the user's exploratory search compared to the conventional image search methods and, more importantly, provides users with more robust results to satisfy their exploring experience.},

abstract = {Current research on Web search has focused on optimizing and evaluating single queries. However, a significant fraction of user queries are part of more complex tasks [Jones and Klinkner 2008] which span multiple queries across one or more search sessions [Liu and Belkin 2010; Kotov et al. 2011]. An ideal search engine would not only retrieve relevant results for a user's particular query but also be able to identify when the user is engaged in a more complex task and aid the user in completing that task [Morris et al. 2008; Agichtein et al. 2012]. Toward optimizing whole-session or task relevance, we characterize and address the problem of intrinsic diversity (ID) in retrieval [Radlinski et al. 2009], a type of complex task that requires multiple interactions with current search engines. Unlike existing work on extrinsic diversity [Carbonell and Goldstein 1998; Zhai et al. 2003; Chen and Karger 2006] that deals with ambiguity in intent across multiple users, ID queries often have little ambiguity in intent but seek content covering a variety of aspects on a shared theme. In such scenarios, the underlying needs are typically exploratory, comparative, or breadth-oriented in nature. We identify and address three key problems for ID retrieval: identifying authentic examples of ID tasks from post-hoc analysis of behavioral signals in search logs; learning to identify initiator queries that mark the start of an ID search task; and given an initiator query, predicting which content to prefetch and rank.},

This textual information is increasingly linked to geographical coordinates, which makes it possible to learn how people refer to places by identifying correlations between the occurrence of terms and the locations of the corresponding social media objects. Recent work has focused on how this potentially rich source of geographic information can be used to estimate geographic coordinates for previously unseen Flickr photos or Twitter messages. In this article, we extend this work by analysing to what extent probabilistic language models trained on Flickr and Twitter can be used to assign coordinates to Wikipedia articles. Our results show that exploiting these language models substantially outperforms both (i) classical gazetteer-based methods (in particular, using Yahoo! Placemaker and Geonames) and (ii) language modelling approaches trained on Wikipedia alone. This supports the hypothesis that social media are important sources of geographic information, which are valuable beyond the scope of individual applications.},

abstract = {The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is acknowledged as the de facto standard for semistructured data representation and data exchange on the Web and many other scenarios. A well-known shortcoming of XML is its verbosity, which increases manipulation, transmission, and processing costs. Various structure-blind and structure-conscious compression techniques can be applied to XML, and some are even access-friendly, meaning that the documents can be efficiently accessed in compressed form. Direct access is necessary to implement the query languages XPath and XQuery, which are the standard ones to exploit the expressiveness of XML. While a good deal of theoretical and practical proposals exist to solve XPath/XQuery operations on XML, only a few ones are well integrated with a compression format that supports the required access operations on the XML data. In this work we go one step further and design a compression format for XML collections that boosts the performance of XPath queries on the data. This is done by designing compressed representations of the XML data that support some complex operations apart from just accessing the data, and those are exploited to solve key components of the XPath queries. Our system, called XXS, is aimed at XML collections containing natural language text, which are compressed to within 35%--50% of their original size while supporting a large subset of XPath operations in time competitive with, and many times outperforming, the best state-of-the-art systems that work on uncompressed representations.},

abstract = {The prediction of trust relationships in social networks plays an important role in the analytics of the networks. Although various link prediction algorithms for general networks may be adapted for this purpose, the recent notion of “trust propagation” has been shown to effectively capture the trust-formation mechanisms and resulted in an effective prediction algorithm. This article builds on the concept of trust propagation and presents a probabilistic trust propagation model. Our model exploits the modern framework of probabilistic graphical models, more specifically, factor graphs. Under this model, the trust prediction problem can be formulated as a statistical inference problem and we derive the belief propagation algorithm as a solver for trust prediction. The model and algorithm are tested using datasets from Epinions and Ciao, by which performance advantages over the previous algorithms are demonstrated.},

abstract = {Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. A user can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limited distance range, so the user-item matrix is very sparse, which creates a big challenge to the traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity information.In this article, we propose LCARS, a location-content-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) or events (e.g., concerts and exhibitions) by giving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live, but also in a city that is new to them. Specifically, LCARS consists of two components: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part, called LCA-LDA, is designed to learn the interest of each individual user and the local preference of each individual city by capturing item cooccurrence patterns and exploiting item contents. The online recommendation part takes a querying user along with a querying city as input, and automatically combines the learned interest of the querying user and the local preference of the querying city to produce the top-k recommendations. To speed up the online process, a scalable query processing technique is developed by extending both the Threshold Algorithm (TA) and TA-approximation algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our recommender system on two real datasets, that is, DoubanEvent and Foursquare, and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The results show the superiority of LCARS in recommending spatial items for users, especially when traveling to new cities, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Besides, the experimental analysis results also demonstrate the excellent interpretability of LCARS.},

abstract = {Traditionally, in many probabilistic retrieval models, query terms are assumed to be independent. Although such models can achieve reasonably good performance, associations can exist among terms from a human being’s point of view. There are some recent studies that investigate how to model term associations/dependencies by proximity measures. However, the modeling of term associations theoretically under the probabilistic retrieval framework is still largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce a new concept cross term, to model term proximity, with the aim of boosting retrieval performance. With cross terms, the association of multiple query terms can be modeled in the same way as a simple unigram term. In particular, an occurrence of a query term is assumed to have an impact on its neighboring text. The degree of the query-term impact gradually weakens with increasing distance from the place of occurrence. We use shape functions to characterize such impacts. Based on this assumption, we first propose a bigram CRoss TErm Retrieval (CRTER2) model as the basis model, and then recursively propose a generalized n-gram CRoss TErm Retrieval (CRTERn) model for n query terms, where n &gt; 2. Specifically, a bigram cross term occurs when the corresponding query terms appear close to each other, and its impact can be modeled by the intersection of the respective shape functions of the query terms. For an n-gram cross term, we develop several distance metrics with different properties and employ them in the proposed models for ranking. We also show how to extend the language model using the newly proposed cross terms. Extensive experiments on a number of TREC collections demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models.},

For better usage of existing resource-selection techniques, it is desirable to know what the fundamental differences between them are and in what settings one is superior to others. However, little is understood still about the actual behavior of resource-selection methods. In this work, we focus on small-document approaches to resource selection that rank and select sources based on the ranking of their documents. We pose a number of research questions and approach them by three types of analyses. First, we present existing small-document techniques in a unified framework and analyze them theoretically. Second, we propose using a qualitative analysis to study the behavior of different small-document approaches. Third, we present a novel experimental methodology to evaluate small-document techniques and to validate the results of the qualitative analysis. This way, we answer the posed research questions and provide insights about small-document methods in general and about each technique in particular.},

abstract = {Although Web search techniques have greatly facilitate users’ information seeking, there are still quite a lot of search sessions that cannot provide satisfactory results, which are more serious in Web image search scenarios. How to understand user intent from observed data is a fundamental issue and of paramount significance in improving image search performance. Previous research efforts mostly focus on discovering user intent either from clickthrough behavior in user search logs (e.g., Google), or from social data to facilitate vertical image search in a few limited social media platforms (e.g., Flickr). This article aims to combine the virtues of these two information sources to complement each other, that is, sensing and understanding users’ interests from social media platforms and transferring this knowledge to rerank the image search results in general image search engines. Toward this goal, we first propose a novel social-sensed image search framework, where both social media and search engine are jointly considered. To effectively and efficiently leverage these two kinds of platforms, we propose an example-based user interest representation and modeling method, where we construct a hybrid graph from social media and propose a hybrid random-walk algorithm to derive the user-image interest graph. Moreover, we propose a social-sensed image reranking method to integrate the user-image interest graph from social media and search results from general image search engines to rerank the images by fusing their social relevance and visual relevance. We conducted extensive experiments on real-world data from Flickr and Google image search, and the results demonstrated that the proposed methods can significantly improve the social relevance of image search results while maintaining visual relevance well.},

abstract = {Ranked result lists with query-dependent snippets have become state of the art in text search. They are typically implemented by searching, at query time, for occurrences of the query words in the top-ranked documents. This document-based approach has three inherent problems: (i) when a document is indexed by terms which it does not contain literally (e.g., related words or spelling variants), localization of the corresponding snippets becomes problematic; (ii) each query operator (e.g., phrase or proximity search) has to be implemented twice, on the index side in order to compute the correct result set, and on the snippet-generation side to generate the appropriate snippets; and (iii) in a worst case, the whole document needs to be scanned for occurrences of the query words, which could be problematic for very long documents.We present a new index-based method that localizes snippets by information solely computed from the index and that overcomes all three problems. Unlike previous index-based methods, we show how to achieve this at essentially no extra cost in query processing time, by a technique we call operator inversion. We also show how our index-based method allows the caching of individual segments instead of complete documents, which enables a significantly larger cache hit-ratio as compared to the document-based approach. We have fully integrated our implementation with the CompleteSearch engine.},

abstract = {Modelling the distribution of document scores returned from an information retrieval (IR) system in response to a query is of both theoretical and practical importance. One of the goals of modelling document scores in this manner is the inference of document relevance. There has been renewed interest of late in modelling document scores using parameterised distributions. Consequently, a number of hypotheses have been proposed to constrain the mixture distribution from which document scores could be drawn.In this article, we show how a standard performance measure (i.e., average precision) can be inferred from a document score distribution using labelled data. We use the accuracy of the inference of average precision as a measure for determining the usefulness of a particular model of document scores. We provide a comprehensive study which shows that certain mixtures of distributions are able to infer average precision more accurately than others. Furthermore, we analyse a number of mixture distributions with regard to the recall-fallout convexity hypothesis and show that the convexity hypothesis is practically useful.Consequently, based on one of the best-performing score-distribution models, we develop some techniques for query-performance prediction (QPP) by automatically estimating the parameters of the document score-distribution model when relevance information is unknown. We present experimental results that outline the benefits of this approach to query-performance prediction.},

abstract = {Advances in tourism economics have enabled us to collect massive amounts of travel tour data. If properly analyzed, this data could be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist’s choice is affected directly by the travel costs, which includes both financial and time costs. To that end, in this article, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we first propose two ways to represent user cost preference. One way is to represent user cost preference by a two-dimensional vector. Another way is to consider the uncertainty about the cost that a user can afford and introduce a Gaussian prior to model user cost preference. With these two ways of representing user cost preference, we develop different cost-aware latent factor models by incorporating the cost information into the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model, the logistic probabilistic matrix factorization (LPMF) model, and the maximum margin matrix factorization (MMMF) model, respectively. When applied to real-world travel tour data, all the cost-aware recommendation models consistently outperform existing latent factor models with a significant margin.},

However, accessing word-sequence statistics using inverted indexes requires unreasonable processing time or substantial space overhead. Establishing a balance between these competing space and time trade-offs can dramatically improve system performance.In this article, we present and analyze a new index structure designed to improve query efficiency in dependency retrieval models. By adapting a class of (ε, δ)-approximation algorithms originally proposed for sketch summarization in networking applications, we show how to accurately estimate statistics important in term-dependency models with low, probabilistically bounded error rates. The space requirements for the vocabulary of the index is only logarithmically linked to the size of the vocabulary.Empirically, we show that the sketch index can reduce the space requirements of the vocabulary component of an index of n-grams consisting of between 1 and 4 words extracted from the GOV2 collection to less than 0.01% of the space requirements of the vocabulary of a full index. We also show that larger n-gram queries can be processed considerably more efficiently than in current alternatives, such as positional and next-word indexes.},

This new external-memory algorithm, called EM-SA-DS, uses novel cache data structures to construct a suffix array in a sequential scanning manner with good data spatial locality: data is read from or written to disk sequentially. On the assumed external-memory model with RAM capacity Ω((nB)0.5), disk capacity O(n), and size of each I/O block B, all measured in log n-bit words, the I/O complexity of EM-SA-DS is O(n/B).

The major shortcoming of the commonly used stemmers is that they accept the morphological variants of the query words without considering their thematic coherence with the given query, which leads to poor performance. Moreover, for many queries, such approaches also produce retrieval performance that is poorer than no stemming, thereby degrading the robustness. The main goal of this article is to present corpus-based fully automatic stemming algorithms which address these issues. A set of experiments on six TREC collections and three other non-English collections containing news and web documents shows that the proposed query-based stemming algorithms consistently and significantly outperform four state of the art strong stemmers of completely varying principles.

Traditional evaluation approaches do not scale well because they require explicit relevance judgments of document-query pairs, which are expensive to obtain. A promising alternative is the use of interleaved comparison methods, which compare rankers using click data obtained when interleaving their rankings.In this article, we propose a framework for analyzing interleaved comparison methods. An interleaved comparison method has fidelity if the expected outcome of ranker comparisons properly corresponds to the true relevance of the ranked documents. It is sound if its estimates of that expected outcome are unbiased and consistent. It is efficient if those estimates are accurate with only little data.We analyze existing interleaved comparison methods and find that, while sound, none meet our criteria for fidelity. We propose a probabilistic interleave method, which is sound and has fidelity. We show empirically that, by marginalizing out variables that are known, it is more efficient than existing interleaved comparison methods. Using importance sampling we derive a sound extension that is able to reuse historical data collected in previous comparisons of other ranker pairs.},

In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall.

The similarity upper bound takes a lightweight computation to filter out unnecessary time-consuming computation for the actual similarity between two videos, making the search process more efficient.

Much less research has been devoted to a third such strategy, training label cleaning (TLC), which consists in devising ranking functions that sort the original training examples in terms of how likely it is that the human annotator has mislabelled them. This provides a convenient means for the human annotator to revise the training set so as to improve its quality. Working in the context of boosting-based learning methods for multilabel classification we present three different techniques for performing TLC and, on three widely used TC benchmarks, evaluate them by their capability of spotting training documents that, for experimental reasons only, we have purposefully mislabelled. We also evaluate the degradation in classification effectiveness that these mislabelled texts bring about, and to what extent training label cleaning can prevent this degradation.},

abstract = {To explore the information seeking behaviors in microblogosphere, the microblog track at TREC 2011 introduced a real-time ad-hoc retrieval task that aims at ranking relevant tweets in reverse-chronological order. We study this problem via a two-phase approach: 1) retrieving tweets in an ad-hoc way; 2) utilizing the temporal information of tweets to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of tweets. Tweets can be categorized into two types. One type consists of short messages not containing any URL of a Web page. The other type has at least one URL of a Web page in addition to a short message. These two types of tweets have different structures. In the first phase, to address the structural difference of tweets, we propose a method to rank tweets using the divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first rank the two types of tweets separately. This produces two rankings, one for each type. Then we merge these two rankings of tweets into one ranking. In the second phase, we first categorize queries into several types by exploring the temporal distributions of their top-retrieved tweets from the first phase; then we calculate the time-related relevance scores of tweets according to the classified types of queries; finally we combine the time scores with the IR scores from the first phase to produce a ranking of tweets. Experimental results achieved by using the TREC 2011 and TREC 2012 queries over the TREC Tweets2011 collection show that: (i) our way of ranking the two types of tweets separately and then merging them together yields better retrieval effectiveness than ranking them simultaneously; (ii) our way of incorporating temporal information into the retrieval process yields further improvements, and (iii) our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods in retrieval effectiveness.},

abstract = {The queries people issue to a search engine and the results clicked following a query change over time. For example, after the earthquake in Japan in March 2011, the query japan spiked in popularity and people issuing the query were more likely to click government-related results than they would prior to the earthquake. We explore the modeling and prediction of such temporal patterns in Web search behavior. We develop a temporal modeling framework adapted from physics and signal processing and harness it to predict temporal patterns in search behavior using smoothing, trends, periodicities, and surprises. Using current and past behavioral data, we develop a learning procedure that can be used to construct models of users' Web search activities. We also develop a novel methodology that learns to select the best prediction model from a family of predictive models for a given query or a class of queries. Experimental results indicate that the predictive models significantly outperform baseline models that weight historical evidence the same for all queries. We present two applications where new methods introduced for the temporal modeling of user behavior significantly improve upon the state of the art. Finally, we discuss opportunities for using models of temporal dynamics to enhance other areas of Web search and information retrieval.},

The problem of sorting the suffixes of T is also known as constructing the suffix array (SA) for T. The theoretical memory usage of SACA-K is n log K + n log n + K log n bits. Moreover, we also have a practical implementation for SACA-K that uses n bytes + (n + 256) words and is suitable for strings over any alphabet up to full ASCII, where a word is log n bits. In our experiment, SACA-K outperforms SA-IS that was previously the most time- and space-efficient linear-time SA construction algorithm (SACA). SACA-K is around 33% faster and uses a smaller deterministic workspace of K words, where the workspace is the space needed beyond the input string and the output SA. Given K=O(1), SACA-K runs in linear time and O(1) workspace. To the best of our knowledge, such a result is the first reported in the literature with a practical source code publicly available.},

In this work, we propose a two-step methodology for discovering tasks that users try to perform through search engines. First, we identify user tasks from individual user sessions stored in search engine query logs. In our vision, a user task is a set of possibly noncontiguous queries (within a user search session), which refer to the same need. Second, we discover collective tasks by aggregating similar user tasks, possibly performed by distinct users. To discover user tasks, we propose query similarity functions based on unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. We present a set of query clustering methods that exploit these functions in order to detect user tasks. All the proposed solutions were evaluated on a manually-built ground truth, and two of them performed better than state-of-the-art approaches. To detect collective tasks, we propose four methods that cluster previously discovered user tasks, which in turn are represented by the bag-of-words extracted from their composing queries. These solutions were also evaluated on another manually-built ground truth.},

In the context of real-time search on tweets, this work explores candidate generation in a two-stage retrieval architecture where an initial list of results is processed by a second-stage rescorer to produce the final output. We introduce Bloom filter chains, a novel extension of Bloom filters that can dynamically expand to efficiently represent an arbitrarily long and growing list of monotonically-increasing integers with a constant false positive rate. Using a collection of Bloom filter chains, a novel approximate candidate generation algorithm called BWand is able to perform both conjunctive and disjunctive retrieval. Experiments show that our algorithm is many times faster than competitive baselines and that this increased performance does not require sacrificing end-to-end effectiveness. Our results empirically characterize the trade-off space defined by output quality, query evaluation speed, and memory footprint for this particular search architecture.},

In this article, we propose to investigate pure high-order dependence among a number of words forming an unseparable semantic entity, that is, the high-order dependence that cannot be reduced to the random coincidence of lower-order dependencies. We believe that identifying these pure high-order dependence patterns would lead to a better representation of documents and novel retrieval models. Specifically, two formal definitions of pure dependence—unconditional pure dependence (UPD) and conditional pure dependence (CPD)—are defined. The exact decision on UPD and CPD, however, is NP-hard in general. We hence derive and prove the sufficient criteria that entail UPD and CPD, within the well-principled information geometry (IG) framework, leading to a more feasible UPD/CPD identification procedure. We further develop novel methods for extracting word patterns with pure high-order dependence. Our methods are applied to and extensively evaluated on three typical IR tasks: text classification and text retrieval without and with query expansion.},

abstract = {Several questions remain unanswered by the existing literature concerning the deployment of query-dependent features within learning to rank. In this work, we investigate three research questions in order to empirically ascertain best practices for learning-to-rank deployments. (i) Previous work in data fusion that pre-dates learning to rank showed that while different retrieval systems could be effectively combined, the combination of multiple models within the same system was not as effective. In contrast, the existing learning-to-rank datasets (e.g., LETOR), often deploy multiple weighting models as query-dependent features within a single system, raising the question as to whether such a combination is needed. (ii) Next, we investigate whether the training of weighting model parameters, traditionally required for effective retrieval, is necessary within a learning-to-rank context. (iii) Finally, we note that existing learning-to-rank datasets use weighting model features calculated on different fields (e.g., title, content, or anchor text), even though such weighting models have been criticized in the literature. Experiments addressing these three questions are conducted on Web search datasets, using various weighting models as query-dependent and typical query-independent features, which are combined using three learning-to-rank techniques. In particular, we show and explain why multiple weighting models should be deployed as features. Moreover, we unexpectedly find that training the weighting model's parameters degrades learned model's effectiveness. Finally, we show that computing a weighting model separately for each field is less effective than more theoretically-sound field-based weighting models.},

We present new preprocessing techniques that achieve interactive query times on large text collections (100 GB of text, served by a single machine). We consider two similarity measures, one where the query terms match similar terms in the collection (e.g., algorithm matches algoritm or vice versa) and one where the query terms match terms with a similar prefix in the collection (e.g., alori matches algorithm).

However, both generating binary codes and encoding unseen data effectively and efficiently remain very challenging tasks. In this article, we focus on these tasks to implement approximate similarity search by proposing a novel hash based method named sparse hashing (SH for short). To generate interpretable (or semantically meaningful) binary codes, the proposed SH first converts original data into low-dimensional data through a novel nonnegative sparse coding method. SH then converts the low-dimensional data into Hamming space (i.e., binary encoding low-dimensional data) by a new binarization rule. After this, training data are represented by generated binary codes. To efficiently and effectively encode unseen data, SH learns hash functions by taking a-priori knowledge into account, such as implicit group effect of the features in training data, and the correlations between original space and the learned Hamming space. SH is able to perform fast approximate similarity search by efficient bit XOR operations in the memory of a modern PC with short binary code representations. Experimental results show that the proposed SH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.},

It is hardly possible to obtain central control over information collections and systems in these environments. Searching for information in these information spaces has brought about problems beyond traditional boundaries of information retrieval (IR) research. This article addresses one important aspect of scalability challenges facing information retrieval models and investigates a decentralized, organic view of information systems pertaining to search in large-scale networks. Drawing on observations from earlier studies, we conduct a series of experiments on decentralized searches in large-scale networked information spaces. Results show that how distributed systems interconnect is crucial to retrieval performance and scalability of searching. Particularly, in various experimental settings and retrieval tasks, we find a consistent phenomenon, namely, the Clustering Paradox, in which the level of network clustering (semantic overlay) imposes a scalability limit. Scalable searches are well supported by a specific, balanced level of network clustering emerging from local system interconnectivity. Departure from that level, either stronger or weaker clustering, leads to search performance degradation, which is dramatic in large-scale networks.},

abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in information extraction from unstructured text. Most previous machine-learning-based NER systems are domain-specific, which implies that they may only perform well on some specific domains (e.g., Newswire) but tend to adapt poorly to other related but different domains (e.g., Weblog). Recently, transfer learning techniques have been proposed to NER. However, most transfer learning approaches to NER are developed for binary classification, while NER is a multiclass classification problem in nature. Therefore, one has to first reduce the NER task to multiple binary classification tasks and solve them independently. In this article, we propose a new transfer learning method, named Transfer Joint Embedding (TJE), for cross-domain multiclass classification, which can fully exploit the relationships between classes (labels), and reduce domain difference in data distributions for transfer learning. More specifically, we aim to embed both labels (outputs) and high-dimensional features (inputs) from different domains (e.g., a source domain and a target domain) into a unified low-dimensional latent space, where 1) each label is represented by a prototype and the intrinsic relationships between labels can be measured by Euclidean distance; 2) the distance in data distributions between the source and target domains can be reduced; 3) the source domain labeled data are closer to their corresponding label-prototypes than others. After the latent space is learned, classification on the target domain data can be done with the simple nearest neighbor rule in the latent space. Furthermore, in order to scale up TJE, we propose an efficient algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Finally, we apply the proposed TJE method for NER across different domains on the ACE 2005 dataset, which is a benchmark in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TJE and show that TJE can outperform state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches to NER.},

In this article, a novel framework is proposed that models reformulation as a distribution of actual queries, where each query is a variation of the original query. This approach considers an actual query as the basic unit and thus captures important query-level dependencies between words and phrases. An implementation of this framework that only uses publicly available resources is proposed, which makes fair comparisons with other methods using TREC collections possible. Specifically, this implementation consists of a query generation step that analyzes the passages containing query words to generate reformulated queries and a probability estimation step that learns a distribution for reformulated queries by optimizing the retrieval performance. Experiments on TREC collections show that the proposed model can significantly outperform previous reformulation models.},

abstract = {Topic modeling provides a powerful way to analyze the content of a collection of documents. It has become a popular tool in many research areas, such as text mining, information retrieval, natural language processing, and other related fields. In real-world applications, however, the usefulness of topic modeling is limited due to scalability issues. Scaling to larger document collections via parallelization is an active area of research, but most solutions require drastic steps, such as vastly reducing input vocabulary. In this article we introduce Regularized Latent Semantic Indexing (RLSI)---including a batch version and an online version, referred to as batch RLSI and online RLSI, respectively---to scale up topic modeling. Batch RLSI and online RLSI are as effective as existing topic modeling techniques and can scale to larger datasets without reducing input vocabulary. Moreover, online RLSI can be applied to stream data and can capture the dynamic evolution of topics. Both versions of RLSI formalize topic modeling as a problem of minimizing a quadratic loss function regularized by ℓ1 and/or ℓ2 norm. This formulation allows the learning process to be decomposed into multiple suboptimization problems which can be optimized in parallel, for example, via MapReduce. We particularly propose adopting ℓ1 norm on topics and ℓ2 norm on document representations to create a model with compact and readable topics and which is useful for retrieval. In learning, batch RLSI processes all the documents in the collection as a whole, while online RLSI processes the documents in the collection one by one. We also prove the convergence of the learning of online RLSI. Relevance ranking experiments on three TREC datasets show that batch RLSI and online RLSI perform better than LSI, PLSI, LDA, and NMF, and the improvements are sometimes statistically significant. Experiments on a Web dataset containing about 1.6 million documents and 7 million terms, demonstrate a similar boost in performance.},

In this article, we investigate how the information need of users, as expressed by their queries, is affected by their physical detachment, as estimated by their physical location in relation to that of the event, and by their social detachment, as quantified by the number of their acquaintances who may be affected by the event. Drawing on large-scale data from ten major events, we show that social and physical detachment levels of users are a major influence on their search engine queries. We demonstrate how knowing social and physical detachment levels can assist in improving retrieval for two applications: identifying search queries related to events and ranking results in response to event-related queries. We find that the average precision in identifying relevant search queries improves by approximately 18%, and that the average precision of ranking that uses detachment information improves by 10%. Using both types of detachment achieved a larger gain in performance than each of them separately.},

abstract = {The supervised classification of XML documents by structure involves learning predictive models in which certain structural regularities discriminate the individual document classes. Hitherto, research has focused on the adoption of prespecified substructures. This is detrimental for classification effectiveness, since the a priori chosen substructures may not accord with the structural properties of the XML documents. Therein, an unexplored question is how to choose the type of structural regularity that best adapts to the structures of the available XML documents.We tackle this problem through X-Class, an approach that handles all types of tree-like substructures and allows for choosing the most discriminatory one. Algorithms are designed to learn compact rule-based classifiers in which the chosen substructures discriminate the classes of XML documents.X-Class is studied across various domains and types of substructures. Its classification performance is compared against several rule-based and SVM-based competitors. Empirical evidence reveals that the classifiers induced by X-Class are compact, scalable, and at least as effective as the established competitors. In particular, certain substructures allow the induction of very compact classifiers that generally outperform the rule-based competitors in terms of effectiveness over all chosen corpora of XML data. Furthermore, such classifiers are substantially as effective as the SVM-based competitor, with the additional advantage of a high-degree of interpretability.},

abstract = {Recall, the proportion of relevant documents retrieved, is an important measure of effectiveness in information retrieval, particularly in the legal, patent, and medical domains. Where document sets are too large for exhaustive relevance assessment, recall can be estimated by assessing a random sample of documents, but an indication of the reliability of this estimate is also required. In this article, we examine several methods for estimating two-tailed recall confidence intervals. We find that the normal approximation in current use provides poor coverage in many circumstances, even when adjusted to correct its inappropriate symmetry. Analytic and Bayesian methods based on the ratio of binomials are generally more accurate but are inaccurate on small populations. The method we recommend derives beta-binomial posteriors on retrieved and unretrieved yield, with fixed hyperparameters, and a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution of recall. We demonstrate that this method gives mean coverage at or near the nominal level, across several scenarios, while being balanced and stable. We offer advice on sampling design, including the allocation of assessments to the retrieved and unretrieved segments, and compare the proposed beta-binomial with the officially reported normal intervals for recent TREC Legal Track iterations.},

Traditional Information Retrieval methods consider the relevance of documents to a topic but are unable to differentiate between subjective and objective documents. Opinion retrieval is a retrieval task in which not only the relevance of a document to the topic is important but also the amount of opinion expressed in the document about the topic. In this article, we address the blog post opinion retrieval task and propose methods that rank blog posts according to their relevance and opinionatedness toward a topic. We propose estimating the opinion density at each position in a document using a general opinion lexicon and kernel density functions. We propose and investigate different models for aggregating the opinion density at query terms positions to estimate the opinion score of every document. We then combine the opinion score with the relevance score based on a probabilistic justification. Experimental results on the BLOG06 dataset show that the proposed method provides significant improvement over the standard TREC baselines. The proposed models also achieve much higher performance compared to all state of the art methods.},

Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) transliteration-based approaches that leverage phonetic similarity and (b) corpus-based approaches that exploit bilingual cooccurrences. These approaches suffer from inaccuracy and scarcity, respectively. In clear contrast, we use under-leveraged resources of monolingual entity cooccurrences crawled from entity search engines, which are represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora, respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach to exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual cooccurrences. This approach, which builds upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work requiring scarce resources of parallel or comparable corpus while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. In addition, by parallelizing the mapping process on multicore architectures, we speed up the computation by more than 10 times per unit accuracy. We validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach using real-life datasets.},

The graph-based sentiment (GBS) crawler uses a text classifier that employs both topic and sentiment categorization modules to assess the relevance of candidate pages. This information is also used to label nodes in web graphs that are employed by the tunneling mechanism to improve collection recall. Experimental results on two test beds revealed that GBS was able to provide better precision and recall than seven comparison crawlers. Moreover, GBS was able to collect a large proportion of the relevant content after traversing far fewer pages than comparison methods. GBS outperformed comparison methods on various categories of Web pages in the test beds, including collection of blogs, Web forums, and social networking Web site content. Further analysis revealed that both the sentiment classification module and graph-based tunneling mechanism played an integral role in the overall effectiveness of the GBS crawler.},

Stability is defined to measure the extent to which a recommendation algorithm provides predictions that are consistent with each other. Specifically, for a stable algorithm, adding some of the algorithm’s own predictions to the algorithm’s training data (for example, if these predictions were confirmed as accurate by users) would not invalidate or change the other predictions. While stability is an interesting theoretical property that can provide additional understanding about recommendation algorithms, we believe stability to be a desired practical property for recommender systems designers as well, because unstable recommendations can potentially decrease users’ trust in recommender systems and, as a result, reduce users’ acceptance of recommendations. In this article, we also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of stability for six popular recommendation algorithms on four real-world datasets. Our results suggest that stability performance of individual recommendation algorithms is consistent across a variety of datasets and settings. In particular, we find that model-based recommendation algorithms consistently demonstrate higher stability than neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques. In addition, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis of many important factors (e.g., the sparsity of original rating data, normalization of input data, the number of new incoming ratings, the distribution of incoming ratings, the distribution of evaluation data, etc.) and report the impact they have on recommendation stability.},

abstract = {Fake medical Web sites have become increasingly prevalent. Consequently, much of the health-related information and advice available online is inaccurate and/or misleading. Scores of medical institution Web sites are for organizations that do not exist and more than 90% of online pharmacy Web sites are fraudulent. In addition to monetary losses exacted on unsuspecting users, these fake medical Web sites have severe public safety ramifications. According to a World Health Organization report, approximately half the drugs sold on the Web are counterfeit, resulting in thousands of deaths. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm called recursive trust labeling (RTL). RTL uses underlying content and graph-based classifiers, coupled with a recursive labeling mechanism, for enhanced detection of fake medical Web sites. The proposed method was evaluated on a test bed encompassing nearly 100 million links between 930,000 Web sites, including 1,000 known legitimate and fake medical sites. The experimental results revealed that RTL was able to significantly improve fake medical Web site detection performance over 19 comparison content and graph-based methods, various meta-learning techniques, and existing adaptive learning approaches, with an overall accuracy of over 94%. Moreover, RTL was able to attain high performance levels even when the training dataset composed of as little as 30 Web sites. With the increased popularity of eHealth and Health 2.0, the results have important implications for online trust, security, and public safety.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed increased efforts on detecting topics and events from Web search logs, since this kind of data not only capture web content but also reflect the users’ activities. However, the majority of existing work is focused on exploiting clustering techniques for topic and event detection. Due to the huge size and the evolving nature of Web data, existing clustering approaches are limited to meet the real-time demand. To that end, in this article, we propose a method called LETD to detect evolving topics in a timely manner. Also, we design the techniques to extract events from topics and to infer the evolving relationship among the events. For topic detection, we first provide a measurement to select the important URLs, which are most likely to describe a real-life topic. Then, starting from these selected URLs, we exploit the local expansion method to find other topic-related URLs. Moreover, in the LETD framework, we design algorithms based on Random Walk and Markov Random Fields (MRF), respectively. Because the LETD method exploits a divide-and-conquer strategy to process the data, it is more efficient than existing methods based on clustering techniques. To better illustrate the LETD framework, we develop a demo system StoryTeller which can discover hot topics and events, infer the evolving relationships among events, and visualize information in a storytelling way. This demo system can provide a global view of the topic development and help users target the interesting events more conveniently. Finally, experimental results on real-world Microsoft click-through data have shown that StoryTeller can find real-life hot topics and meaningful evolving relationships among events, and has also demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the LETD method.},

In recency search, for instance, the relevance of documents to a query on breaking news often changes significantly over time, requiring effective adaptation to user intention. In this article, we focus on recency search and study a number of algorithms to improve ranking results by leveraging user click feedback. Our contributions are threefold. First, we use commercial search engine sessions collected in a random exploration bucket for reliable offline evaluation of these algorithms, which provides an unbiased comparison across algorithms without online bucket tests. Second, we propose an online learning approach that reranks and improves the search results for recency queries near real-time based on user clicks. This approach is very general and can be combined with sophisticated click models. Third, our empirical comparison of a dozen algorithms on real-world search data suggests importance of a few algorithmic choices in these applications, including generalization across different query-document pairs, specialization to popular queries, and near real-time adaptation of user clicks for reranking.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a factoid question-answering system, Sibyl, specifically tailored for question answering (QA) on spoken-word documents. This work explores, for the first time, which techniques can be robustly adapted from the usual QA on written documents to the more difficult spoken document scenario. More specifically, we study new information retrieval (IR) techniques designed or speech, and utilize several levels of linguistic information for the speech-based QA task. These include named-entity detection with phonetic information, syntactic parsing applied to speech transcripts, and the use of coreference resolution. Sibyl is largely based on supervised machine-learning techniques, with special focus on the answer extraction step, and makes little use of handcrafted knowledge. Consequently, it should be easily adaptable to other domains and languages. Sibyl and all its modules are extensively evaluated on the European Parliament Plenary Sessions English corpus, comparing manual with automatic transcripts obtained by three different automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems that exhibit significantly different word error rates. This data belongs to the CLEF 2009 track for QA on speech transcripts. The main results confirm that syntactic information is very useful for learning to rank question candidates, improving results on both manual and automatic transcripts, unless the ASR quality is very low. At the same time, our experiments on coreference resolution reveal that the state-of-the-art technology is not mature enough to be effectively exploited for QA with spoken documents. Overall, the performance of Sibyl is comparable or better than the state-of-the-art on this corpus, confirming the validity of our approach.},

Two feature extractors based on neural networks (NN) are introduced: the first producing phone-state posteriors and the second making use of a compressive NN layer. They are combined with three different QbE detectors: while the Gaussian mixture model/hidden Markov model (GMM/HMM) and dynamic time warping (DTW) both work on continuous feature vectors, the third one, based on weighted finite-state transducers (WFST), processes phone lattices. QbE STD is compared to two standard STD systems with text queries: acoustic keyword spotting and WFST-based search of phone strings in phone lattices. The results are reported on four languages (Czech, English, Hungarian, and Levantine Arabic) using standard metrics: equal error rate (EER) and two versions of popular figure-of-merit (FOM). Language-dependent and language-independent cases are investigated; the latter being particularly interesting for scenarios lacking standard resources to train speech recognition systems. While the DTW and GMM/HMM approaches produce the best results for a language-dependent setup depending on the target language, the GMM/HMM approach performs the best dealing with a language-independent setup. As far as WFSTs are concerned, they are promising as they allow for indexing and fast search.},

More recently, a good deal of research has focused on the issues of indexing and browsing multimedia records of meetings. Most research in this area, however, is still based on data collected in laboratories, under somewhat artificial conditions. This article presents an analysis of the discourse structure and spontaneous interactions at real-life multidisciplinary medical team meetings held as part of the work routine in a major hospital. It is hypothesized that the conversational structure of these meetings, as indicated by sequencing and duration of vocalizations, enables segmentation into individual patient case discussions. The task of segmenting audio-visual records of multidisciplinary medical team meetings is described as a topic segmentation task, and a method for automatic segmentation is proposed. An empirical evaluation based on hand labelled data is presented, which determines the optimal length of vocalization sequences for segmentation, and establishes the competitiveness of the method with approaches based on more complex knowledge sources. The effectiveness of Bayesian classification as a segmentation method, and its applicability to meeting segmentation in other domains are discussed.},

abstract = {Spoken term detection (STD) is a key technology for spoken information retrieval. As compared to the conventional speech transcription and keyword spotting, STD is an open-vocabulary task and has to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms. Approaches based on subword units, for example phones, are widely used to solve the OOV issue; however, performance on OOV terms is still substantially inferior to that of in-vocabulary (INV) terms. The performance degradation on OOV terms can be attributed to a multitude of factors. One particular factor we address in this article is the unreliable confidence estimation caused by weak acoustic and language modeling due to the absence of OOV terms in the training corpora. We propose a direct posterior confidence derived from a discriminative model, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP). The new confidence considers a wide-range acoustic context which is usually important for speech recognition and retrieval; moreover, it localizes on detected speech segments and therefore avoids the impact of long-span word context which is usually unreliable for OOV term detection.In this article, we first develop an extensive discussion about the modeling weakness problem associated with OOV terms, and then propose our approach to address this problem based on direct poster confidence. Our experiments carried out on spontaneous and conversational multiparty meeting speech, demonstrate that the proposed technique provides a significant improvement in STD performance as compared to conventional lattice-based confidence, in particular for OOV terms. Furthermore, the new confidence estimation approach is fused with other advanced techniques for OOV treatment, such as stochastic pronunciation modeling and discriminative confidence normalization. This leads to an integrated solution for OOV term detection that results in a large performance improvement.},

abstract = {Accessible emulation is often the method of choice for maintaining digital objects, specifically complex ones such as applications, business processes, or electronic art. However, validating the emulator’s ability to faithfully reproduce the original behavior of digital objects is complicated.This article presents an evaluation framework and a set of tests that allow assessment of the degree to which system emulation preserves original characteristics and thus significant properties of digital artifacts. The original system, hardware, and software properties are described. Identical environment is then recreated via emulation. Automated user input is used to eliminate potential confounders. The properties of a rendered form of the object are then extracted automatically or manually either in a target state, a series of states, or as a continuous stream. The concepts described in this article enable preservation planners to evaluate how emulation affects the behavior of digital objects compared to their behavior in the original environment. We also review how these principles can and should be applied to the evaluation of migration and other preservation strategies as a general principle of evaluating the invocation and faithful rendering of digital objects and systems. The article concludes with design requirements for emulators developed for digital preservation tasks.},

abstract = {This article studies a novel problem in image search. Given a text query and the image ranking list returned by an image search system, we propose an approach to automatically predict the search performance. We demonstrate that, in order to estimate the mathematical expectations of Average Precision (AP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), we only need to predict the relevance probability of each image. We accomplish the task with a query-adaptive graph-based learning based on the images’ ranking order and visual content. We validate our approach with a large-scale dataset that contains the image search results of 1,165 queries from 4 popular image search engines. Empirical studies demonstrate that our approach is able to generate predictions that are highly correlated with the real search performance. Based on the proposed image search performance prediction scheme, we introduce three applications: image metasearch, multilingual image search, and Boolean image search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate our approach.},

Assuming that the term occurrence follows a binomial distribution, this method is then applied to weight terms (words and punctuation symbols in the current study), representing the lexical specificity of the underlying text. In a final stage, to define an author profile we suggest averaging these text representations and then applying them along with a distance measure to derive a simple and efficient authorship attribution scheme. To evaluate this algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop two experiments, the first based on 5,408 newspaper articles (Glasgow Herald) written in English by 20 distinct authors and the second on 4,326 newspaper articles (La Stampa) written in Italian by 20 distinct authors. These experiments demonstrate that the suggested classification scheme tends to perform better than the Delta rule method based on the most frequent words, better than the chi-square distance based on word profiles and punctuation marks, better than the KLD scheme based on a predefined set of words, and better than the na\"{\i}ve Bayes approach.},

We argue that for retrieval methods that are based on document-query surface-level similarities, the standard deviation can serve as a surrogate for estimating the presumed amount of query drift in the result list, that is, the presence (and dominance) of aspects or topics not related to the query in documents in the list. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the prediction effectiveness of our approach for several retrieval models.

These communities thrive as a result of a small number of highly active users, typically called experts, who provide a large number of high-quality useful answers. Expert identification techniques enable community managers to take measures to retain the experts in the community. There is further value in identifying the experts during the first few weeks of their participation as it would allow measures to nurture and retain them. In this article we address two problems: (a) How to identify current experts in CQA? and (b) How to identify users who have potential of becoming experts in future (potential experts)? In particular, we propose a probabilistic model that captures the selection preferences of users based on the questions they choose for answering. The probabilistic model allows us to run machine learning methods for identifying experts and potential experts. Our results over several popular CQA datasets indicate that experts differ considerably from ordinary users in their selection preferences; enabling us to predict experts with higher accuracy over several baseline models. We show that selection preferences can be combined with baseline measures to improve the predictive performance even further.},

As a consequence, current online music collections store millions of songs and are constantly being enriched with new content. This has created a need for music technologies that allow users to interact with these extensive collections efficiently and effectively. Music search and discovery may be carried out using tags, matching user interests and exploiting content-based acoustic similarity. One major issue in music information retrieval is how to combine such noisy and heterogeneous information sources in order to improve retrieval effectiveness. With this aim in mind, the article explores a novel music retrieval framework based on combining tags and acoustic similarity through a probabilistic graph-based representation of a collection of songs. The retrieval function highlights the path across the graph that most likely observes a user query and is used to improve state-of-the-art music search and discovery engines by delivering more relevant ranking lists. Indeed, by means of an empirical evaluation, we show how the proposed approach leads to better performances than retrieval strategies which rank songs according to individual information sources alone or which use a combination of them.},

In particular, we analyze the agreement of interleaving with manual relevance judgments and observational implicit feedback measures, estimate the statistical efficiency of interleaving, and explore the relative performance of different interleaving variants.

Integrating such proximity scores into efficient query processing, however, has not been equally well studied. Existing methods make use of precomputed lists of documents where tuples of terms, usually pairs, occur together, usually incurring a huge index size compared to term-only indexes. This article introduces a joint framework for trading off index size and result quality, and provides optimization techniques for tuning precomputed indexes towards either maximal result quality or maximal query processing performance under controlled result quality, given an upper bound for the index size. The framework allows to selectively materialize lists for pairs based on a query log to further reduce index size. Extensive experiments with two large text collections demonstrate runtime improvements of more than one order of magnitude over existing text-based processing techniques with reasonable index sizes.},

But as Armstrong et al. [2009b] recently argued, global analysis of experiments suggests that there has actually been little real improvement in ad hoc retrieval effectiveness over time. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of simultaneous testing of many hypotheses using a fixed set of data. We argue that the most common approaches to significance testing ignore a great deal of information about the world. Taking into account even a fairly small amount of this information can lead to very different conclusions about systems than those that have appeared in published literature. We demonstrate how to model a set of IR experiments for analysis both mathematically and practically, and show that doing so can cause p-values from statistical hypothesis tests to increase by orders of magnitude. This has major consequences on the interpretation of experimental results using reusable test collections: it is very difficult to conclude that anything is significant once we have modeled many of the sources of randomness in experimental design and analysis.},

abstract = {Increasingly, special-purpose search engines are being built to enable the retrieval of document-elements like tables, figures, and algorithms [Bhatia et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2007; Hearst et al. 2007]. These search engines present a thumbnail view of document-elements, some document metadata such as the title of the papers and their authors, and the caption of the document-element. While some authors in some disciplines write carefully tailored captions, generally, the author of a document assumes that the caption will be read in the context of the text in the document. When the caption is presented out of context as in a document-element-search-engine result, it may not contain enough information to help the end-user understand what the content of the document-element is. Consequently, end-users examining document-element search results would want a short “synopsis” of this information presented along with the document-element. Having access to the synopsis allows the end-user to quickly understand the content of the document-element without having to download and read the entire document as examining the synopsis takes a shorter time than finding information about a document element by downloading, opening and reading the file. Furthermore, it may allow the end-user to examine more results than they would otherwise. In this paper, we present the first set of methods to extract this useful information (synopsis) related to document-elements automatically. We use Na\"{\i}ve Bayes and support vector machine classifiers to identify relevant sentences from the document text based on the similarity and the proximity of the sentences with the caption and the sentences in the document text that refer to the document-element. We compare the two classification methods and study the effects of different features used. We also investigate the problem of choosing the optimum synopsis-size that strikes a balance between the information content and the size of the generated synopses. A user study is also performed to measure how the synopses generated by our proposed method compare with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Static index pruning techniques permanently remove a presumably redundant part of an inverted file, to reduce the file size and query processing time. These techniques differ in deciding which parts of an index can be removed safely; that is, without changing the top-ranked query results. As defined in the literature, the query view of a document is the set of query terms that access to this particular document, that is, retrieves this document among its top results. In this paper, we first propose using query views to improve the quality of the top results compared against the original results. We incorporate query views in a number of static pruning strategies, namely term-centric, document-centric, term popularity based and document access popularity based approaches, and show that the new strategies considerably outperform their counterparts especially for the higher levels of pruning and for both disjunctive and conjunctive query processing. Additionally, we combine the notions of term and document access popularity to form new pruning strategies, and further extend these strategies with the query views. The new strategies improve the result quality especially for the conjunctive query processing, which is the default and most common search mode of a search engine.},

It is usually fast for single-word searches, yet phrase searches require more expensive intersections. In this article we introduce a different kind of index. It replaces the text using essentially the same space required by the compressed text alone (compression ratio around 35%). Within this space it supports not only decompression of arbitrary passages, but efficient word and phrase searches. Searches are orders of magnitude faster than those over inverted indexes when looking for phrases, and still faster on single-word searches when little space is available. Our new indexes are particularly fast at counting the occurrences of words or phrases. This is useful for computing relevance of words or phrases.We adapt self-indexes that succeeded in indexing arbitrary strings within compressed space to deal with large alphabets. Natural language texts are then regarded as sequences of words, not characters, to achieve word-based self-indexes. We design an architecture that separates the searchable sequence from its presentation aspects. This permits applying case folding, stemming, removing stopwords, etc. as is usual on inverted indexes.},

Very often, some near-duplicate videos exhibit great content changes, while the user perceives little information change, for example, color features change significantly when transforming a color video with a blue filter. These feature changes contribute to low-level video similarity computations, making conventional similarity-based near-duplicate video retrieval techniques incapable of accurately capturing the implicit relationship between two near-duplicate videos with fairly large content modifications. In this paper, we introduce a new dimension for near-duplicate video retrieval. Different from existing near-duplicate video retrieval approaches which are based on video-content similarity, we explore the correlation between two videos. The intuition is that near-duplicate videos should preserve strong information correlation in spite of intensive content changes. More effective retrieval with stronger tolerance is achieved by replacing video-content similarity measures with information correlation analysis. Theoretical justification and experimental results prove the effectiveness of correlation-based near-duplicate retrieval.},

Our goal is to recommend to these students courses that not only help satisfy constraints, but that are also desirable (e.g., popular or taken by similar students). We develop increasingly expressive models for course requirements, and present a variety of schemes for both checking if the requirements are satisfied, and for making recommendations that take into account the requirements. We show that some types of requirements are inherently expensive to check, and we present exact, as well as heuristic techniques, for those cases. Although our work is specific to course requirements, it provides insights into the design of recommendation systems in the presence of complex constraints found in other applications.},

abstract = {Machine-learned ranking functions have shown successes in Web search engines. With the increasing demands on developing effective ranking functions for different search domains, we have seen a big bottleneck, that is, the problem of insufficient labeled training data, which has significantly slowed the development and deployment of machine-learned ranking functions for different domains. There are two possible approaches to address this problem: (1) combining labeled training data from similar domains with the small target-domain labeled data for training or (2) using pairwise preference data extracted from user clickthrough log for the target domain for training. In this article, we propose a new approach called tree-based ranking function adaptation (Trada) to effectively utilize these data sources for training cross-domain ranking functions. Tree adaptation assumes that ranking functions are trained with the Stochastic Gradient Boosting Trees method—a gradient boosting method on regression trees. It takes such a ranking function from one domain and tunes its tree-based structure with a small amount of training data from the target domain. The unique features include (1) automatic identification of the part of the model that needs adjustment for the new domain and (2) appropriate weighing of training examples considering both local and global distributions. Based on a novel pairwise loss function that we developed for pairwise learning, the basic tree adaptation algorithm is also extended (Pairwise Trada) to utilize the pairwise preference data from the target domain to further improve the effectiveness of adaptation. Experiments are performed on real datasets to show that tree adaptation can provide better-quality ranking functions for a new domain than other methods.},

abstract = {Dynamic pruning strategies for information retrieval systems can increase querying efficiency without decreasing effectiveness by using upper bounds to safely omit scoring documents that are unlikely to make the final retrieved set. Often, such upper bounds are pre-calculated at indexing time for a given weighting model. However, this precludes changing, adapting or training the weighting model without recalculating the upper bounds. Instead, upper bounds should be approximated at querying time from various statistics of each term to allow on-the-fly adaptation of the applied retrieval strategy. This article, by using uniform notation, formulates the problem of determining a term upper-bound given a weighting model and discusses the limitations of existing approximations. Moreover, we propose an upper-bound approximation using a constrained nonlinear maximization problem. We prove that our proposed upper-bound approximation does not impact the retrieval effectiveness of several modern weighting models from various different families. We also show the applicability of the approximation for the Markov Random Field proximity model. Finally, we empirically examine how the accuracy of the upper-bound approximation impacts the number of postings scored and the resulting efficiency in the context of several large Web test collections.},

In this work we show that HYB can be constructed at least as fast as INV, and often up to twice as fast. This is because HYB, by its nature, requires only a half-inversion of the data and allows an efficient in-place instead of the traditional merge-based index construction. We also pay particular attention to the cache efficiency of the in-memory posting accumulation, an issue that has not been addressed in previous work, and show that our simple multilevel posting accumulation scheme yields much fewer cache misses compared to related approaches. Finally, we show that HYB supports fast dynamic index updates more easily than INV.},

However, the dimension of semantic granularity also should be considered for effective retrieval. In this article, we propose a semantic granularity-based IR model that takes into account the three dimensions, namely similarity, popularity, and semantic granularity, to improve domain-specific search. In particular, a concept-based computational model is developed to estimate the semantic granularity of documents with reference to a domain ontology. Semantic granularity refers to the levels of semantic detail carried by an information item. The results of our benchmark experiments confirm that the proposed semantic granularity based IR model performs significantly better than the similarity-based baseline in both a bio-medical and an agricultural domain. In addition, a series of user-oriented studies reveal that the proposed document ranking functions resemble the implicit ranking functions exercised by humans. The perceived relevance of the documents delivered by the granularity-based IR system is significantly higher than that produced by a popular search engine for a number of domain-specific search tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the application of semantic granularity to enhance domain-specific IR.},

Chemical search engines identify and index chemical formulae and chemical names appearing in text documents to support efficient search and retrieval in the future. Identifying chemical formulae and chemical names in text automatically has been a hard problem that has met with varying degrees of success in the past. We propose algorithms for chemical formula and chemical name tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that achieve higher accuracy than existing (published) methods. After chemical entities have been identified in text documents, they must be indexed. In order to support user-provided search queries that require a partial match between the chemical name segment used as a keyword or a partial chemical formula, all possible (or a significant number of) subformulae of formulae that appear in any document and all possible subterms (e.g., “methyl”) of chemical names (e.g., “methylethyl ketone”) must be indexed. Indexing all possible subformulae and subterms results in an exponential increase in the storage and memory requirements as well as the time taken to process the indices. We propose techniques to prune the indices significantly without reducing the quality of the returned results significantly. Finally, we propose multiple query semantics to allow users to pose different types of partial search queries for chemical entities. We demonstrate empirically that our search engines improve the relevance of the returned results for search queries involving chemical entities.},

This article presents a novel contextual video recommendation system, called VideoReach, based on multimodal content relevance and user feedback. We consider an online video usually consists of different modalities (i.e., visual and audio track, as well as associated texts such as query, keywords, and surrounding text). Therefore, the recommended videos should be relevant to current viewing in terms of multimodal relevance. We also consider that different parts of videos are with different degrees of interest to a user, as well as different features and modalities have different contributions to the overall relevance. As a result, the recommended videos should also be relevant to current users in terms of user feedback (i.e., user click-through). We then design a unified framework for VideoReach which can seamlessly integrate both multimodal relevance and user feedback by relevance feedback and attention fusion. VideoReach represents one of the first attempts toward contextual recommendation driven by video content and user click-through, without assuming a sufficient collection of user profiles available. We conducted experiments over a large-scale real-world video data and reported the effectiveness of VideoReach.},

abstract = {Information retrieval systems traditionally rely on textual keywords to index and retrieve documents. Keyword-based retrieval may return inaccurate and incomplete results when different keywords are used to describe the same concept in the documents and in the queries. Furthermore, the relationship between these related keywords may be semantic rather than syntactic, and capturing it thus requires access to comprehensive human world knowledge. Concept-based retrieval methods have attempted to tackle these difficulties by using manually built thesauri, by relying on term cooccurrence data, or by extracting latent word relationships and concepts from a corpus. In this article we introduce a new concept-based retrieval approach based on Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a recently proposed method that augments keyword-based text representation with concept-based features, automatically extracted from massive human knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia. Our approach generates new text features automatically, and we have found that high-quality feature selection becomes crucial in this setting to make the retrieval more focused. However, due to the lack of labeled data, traditional feature selection methods cannot be used, hence we propose new methods that use self-generated labeled training data. The resulting system is evaluated on several TREC datasets, showing superior performance over previous state-of-the-art results.},

In order to develop more effective models, it is necessary to understand the deficiencies of the current retrieval models and the relative strengths of each of them. In this article, we propose a general methodology to analytically and experimentally diagnose the weaknesses of a retrieval function, which provides guidance on how to further improve its performance. Our methodology is motivated by the empirical observation that good retrieval performance is closely related to the use of various retrieval heuristics. We connect the weaknesses and strengths of a retrieval function with its implementations of these retrieval heuristics, and propose two strategies to check how well a retrieval function implements the desired retrieval heuristics. The first strategy is to formalize heuristics as constraints, and use constraint analysis to analytically check the implementation of retrieval heuristics. The second strategy is to define a set of relevance-preserving perturbations and perform diagnostic tests to empirically evaluate how well a retrieval function implements retrieval heuristics. Experiments show that both strategies are effective to identify the potential problems in implementations of the retrieval heuristics. The performance of retrieval functions can be improved after we fix these problems.},

abstract = {This article analyzes communication within a set of individuals to extract the representative prototypical groups and provides a novel framework to establish the utility of such groups. Corporations may want to identify representative groups (which are indicative of the overall communication set) because it is easier to track the prototypical groups rather than the entire set. This can be useful for advertising, identifying “hot” spots of resource consumption as well as in mining representative moods or temperature of a community. Our framework has three parts: extraction, characterization, and utility of prototypical groups. First, we extract groups by developing features representing communication dynamics of the individuals. Second, to characterize the overall communication set, we identify a subset of groups within the community as the prototypical groups. Third, we justify the utility of these prototypical groups by using them as predictors of related external phenomena; specifically, stock market movement of technology companies and political polls of Presidential candidates in the 2008 U.S. elections.We have conducted extensive experiments on two popular blogs, Engadget and Huffington Post. We observe that the prototypical groups can predict stock market movement/political polls satisfactorily with mean error rate of 20.32%. Further, our method outperforms baseline methods based on alternative group extraction and prototypical group identification methods. We evaluate the quality of the extracted groups based on their conductance and coverage measures and develop metrics: predictivity and resilience to evaluate their ability to predict a related external time-series variable (stock market movement/political polls). This implies that communication dynamics of individuals are essential in extracting groups in a community, and the prototypical groups extracted by our method are meaningful in characterizing the overall communication sets.},

abstract = {Digital content production and distribution has radically changed our business models. An unprecedented volume of supply is now on offer, whetted by the demand of millions of users from all over the world. Since users cannot be expected to browse through millions of different items to find what they might like, filtering has become a popular technique to connect supply and demand: trusted users are first identified, and their opinions are then used to create recommendations. In this domain, users' trustworthiness has been measured according to one of the following two criteria: taste similarity (i.e., “I trust those who agree with me”), or social ties (i.e., “I trust my friends, and the people that my friends trust”). The former criterion aims at identifying concordant users, but is subject to abuse by malicious behaviors. The latter aims at detecting well-intentioned users, but fails to capture the natural subjectivity of tastes. In this article, we propose a new definition of trusted recommenders, addressing those users that are both well-intentioned and concordant. Based on this characterisation, we propose a novel approach to information filtering that we call dependable filtering. We describe alternative algorithms realizing this approach, and demonstrate, by means of extensive performance evaluation on a variety of real large-scale datasets, the high degree of both accuracy and robustness they entail.},

abstract = {Relational or semistructured data is naturally represented by a graph, where nodes denote entities and directed typed edges represent the relations between them. Such graphs are heterogeneous, describing different types of objects and links. We represent personal information as a graph that includes messages, terms, persons, dates, and other object types, and relations like sent-to and has-term. Given the graph, we apply finite random graph walks to induce a measure of entity similarity, which can be viewed as a tool for performing search in the graph. Experiments conducted using personal email collections derived from the Enron corpus and other corpora show how the different tasks of alias finding, threading, and person name disambiguation can be all addressed as search queries in this framework, where the graph-walk-based similarity metric is preferable to alternative approaches, and further improvements are achieved with learning. While researchers have suggested to tune edge weight parameters to optimize the graph walk performance per task, we apply reranking to improve the graph walk results, using features that describe high-level information such as the paths traversed in the walk. High performance, together with practical runtimes, suggest that the described framework is a useful search system in the PIM domain, as well as in other semistructured domains.},

Furthermore, the performance is substantially better than that of a commonly used passage-based document ranking method that does not exploit inter-item similarities. Our model also generalizes and outperforms a recently proposed reranking method that utilizes inter-document similarities, but which does not exploit passage-based information.

We first investigate one of the predominant operation on inverted indexes, which asks for intersecting two sorted lists of document IDs of different lengths. We explore compression and performance of different inverted list data structures. In particular, we present Lookup, a new data structure that allows intersection in expected time linear in the smaller list.Based on this result, we present the algorithmic core of a full text data base that allows fast Boolean queries, phrase queries, and document reporting using less space than the input text. The system uses a carefully choreographed combination of classical data compression techniques and inverted-index-based search data structures. Our experiments show that inverted indexes are preferable over purely suffix-array-based techniques for in-memory (English) text search engines.A similar system is now running in practice in each core of the distributed data base engine TREX of SAP.},

abstract = {Conjunctive Boolean queries are a key component of modern information retrieval systems, especially when Web-scale repositories are being searched. A conjunctive query q is equivalent to a |q|-way intersection over ordered sets of integers, where each set represents the documents containing one of the terms, and each integer in each set is an ordinal document identifier. As is the case with many computing applications, there is tension between the way in which the data is represented, and the ways in which it is to be manipulated. In particular, the sets representing index data for typical document collections are highly compressible, but are processed using random access techniques, meaning that methods for carrying out set intersections must be alert to issues to do with access patterns and data representation. Our purpose in this article is to explore these trade-offs, by investigating intersection techniques that make use of both uncompressed “integer” representations, as well as compressed arrangements. We also propose a simple hybrid method that provides both compact storage, and also faster intersection computations for conjunctive querying than is possible even with uncompressed representations.},

abstract = {Recently, video search reranking has been an effective mechanism to improve the initial text-based ranking list by incorporating visual consistency among the result videos. While existing methods attempt to rerank all the individual result videos, they suffer from several drawbacks. In this article, we propose a new video reranking paradigm called cluster-based video reranking (CVR). The idea is to first construct a video near-duplicate graph representing the visual similarity relationship among videos, followed by identifying the near-duplicate clusters from the video near-duplicate graph, then ranking the obtained near-duplicate clusters based on cluster properties and intercluster links, and finally for each ranked cluster, a representative video is selected and returned. Compared to existing methods, the new CVR ranks clusters and exhibits several advantages, including superior reranking by utilizing more reliable cluster properties, fast reranking on a small number of clusters, diverse and representative results. Particularly, we formulate the near-duplicate cluster identification as a novel maximally cohesive subgraph mining problem. By leveraging the designed cluster scoring properties indicating the cluster's importance and quality, random walk is applied over the near-duplicate cluster graph to rank clusters. An extensive evaluation study proves the novelty and superiority of our proposals over existing methods.},

These systems often provide the possibility to annotate the content with tags and ratings.Using a random walk through the social annotation graph, we have combined these annotations into a retrieval model that effectively balances the personal preferences and opinions of like-minded users into a single relevance ranking for either content, tags, or people. We use this model to identify the influence of different annotation methods and system design aspects on common ranking tasks in social content systems.Our results show that a combination of rating and tagging information can improve tasks like search and recommendation. The optimal influence of both sources on the ranking is highly dependent on the retrieval task and system design. Results on content search and tag suggestion indicate that the profile created by a user's annotations can be used effectively to adapt the ranking to personal preferences. The random walk reduces sparsity problems by smoothly integrating indirectly related concepts in the relevance ranking, which is especially valuable for cold-start users or individual tagging systems like YouTube and Flickr.},

abstract = {Ranked lists are encountered in research and daily life and it is often of interest to compare these lists even when they are incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.},

We reorder the documents in an initially retrieved set by exploiting implicit asymmetric relationships among them. We consider generation links, which indicate that the language model induced from one document assigns high probability to the text of another. We study a number of reranking criteria based on measures of centrality in the graphs formed by generation links, and show that integrating centrality into standard language-model-based retrieval is quite effective at improving precision at top ranks; the best resultant performance is comparable, and often superior, to that of a state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback-based retrieval approach. In addition, we demonstrate the merits of our language-model-based method for inducing interdocument links by comparing it to previously suggested notions of interdocument similarities (e.g., cosines within the vector-space model).We also show that ourmethods for inducing centrality are substantially more effective than approaches based on document-specific characteristics, several of which are novel to this study.},

Ideally, crawlers should request only those Web pages that have changed since the last crawl; in practice, a crawler may not know whether a Web page has changed before downloading it. In this article, we identify features of Web pages that are correlated to their change frequency. We design a crawling algorithm that clusters Web pages based on features that correlate to their change frequencies obtained by examining past history. The crawler downloads a sample of Web pages from each cluster, and depending upon whether a significant number of these Web pages have changed in the last crawl cycle, it decides whether to recrawl the entire cluster. To evaluate the performance of our incremental crawler, we develop an evaluation framework that measures which crawling policy results in the best search results for the end-user. We run experiments on a real Web data set of about 300,000 distinct URLs distributed among 210 Web sites. The results demonstrate that the clustering-based sampling algorithm effectively clusters the pages with similar change patterns, and our clustering-based crawling algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in that it can improve the quality of the user experience for those who query the search engine.},

This article first describes a probabilistic model that predicts the probabilities of correctness for individual answers in an independent way. It then proposes a novel probabilistic method to jointly predict the correctness of answers by considering both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations. As far as we know, this is the first probabilistic framework that proposes to model the correctness and correlation of answer candidates in multilingual question-answering and provide a novel approach to design a flexible and extensible system architecture for answer selection in multilingual QA. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic methods in English-to-Chinese and English-to-Japanese cross-lingual QA, as well as English, Chinese, and Japanese monolingual QA using TREC and NTCIR questions.},

Therefore, combining relations is the key to effective information extraction (IE) on free text datasets with a small set of training samples. Previous approaches to bootstrapping for IE used different types of relations, such as dependency or co-occurrence, and faced the problems of paraphrasing and misalignment of instances. To cope with these problems, we propose a framework that integrates several types of relations. After extracting candidate entities, our framework evaluates relations between them at the phrasal, dependency, semantic frame, and discourse levels. For each of these levels, we build a classifier that outputs a score for relation instances. In order to integrate these scores, we propose three strategies: (1) integrate evaluation scores from each relation classifier; (2) incorporate the elimination of negatively labeled instances in a previous strategy; and (3) add cascading of extracted relations into strategy (2). Our framework improves the state-of-art results for supervised systems by 8%, 15%, 3%, and 5% on MUC4 (terrorism); MUC6 (management succession); ACE RDC 2003 (news, general types); and ACE RDC 2003 (news, specific types) domains respectively.},

Previous works on this subject primarily focused on enrichment of query features, for example, by augmenting queries with search engine results. In this work, we investigate a completely orthogonal approach—instead of improving feature representation, we aim at drastically increasing the amount of training data. To this end, we propose two semisupervised learning methods that exploit user click-through data. In one approach, we infer class memberships of unlabeled queries from those of labeled ones according to their proximities in a click graph; and then use these automatically labeled queries to train classifiers using query terms as features. In a second approach, click graph learning and query classifier training are conducted jointly with an integrated objective. Our methods are evaluated in two applications, product intent and job intent classification. In both cases, we expand the training data by over two orders of magnitude, leading to significant improvements in classification performance. An additional finding is that with a large amount of training data obtained in this fashion, a classifier based on simple query term features can outperform those using state-of-the-art, augmented features.},

This is a novelty in two senses: it breaks the usual compressor/decompressor symmetry typical of adaptive schemes, and it contradicts the long-standing assumption that only semistatic codes could be searched more efficiently than the uncompressed text. Our novel compression methods are preferable in several aspects over the existing adaptive and semistatic compressors for natural language texts.},

abstract = {Information retrieval research has demonstrated that system performance does not always correlate positively with user performance, and that users often assign positive evaluation scores to search systems even when they are unable to complete tasks successfully. This research investigated the relationship between objective measures of system performance and users' perceptions of that performance. In this study, subjects evaluated the performance of four search systems whose search results were manipulated systematically to produce different orderings and numbers of relevant documents. Three laboratory studies were conducted with a total of eighty-one subjects. The first two studies investigated the effect of the order of five relevant and five nonrelevant documents in a search results list containing ten results on subjects' evaluations. The third study investigated the effect of varying the number of relevant documents in a search results list containing ten results on subjects' evaluations. Results demonstrate linear relationships between subjects' evaluations and the position of relevant documents in a search results list and the total number of relevant documents retrieved. Of the two, number of relevant documents retrieved was a stronger predictor of subjects' evaluation ratings and resulted in subjects using a greater range of evaluation scores.},

abstract = {Document summarization and keyphrase extraction are two related tasks in the IR and NLP fields, and both of them aim at extracting condensed representations from a single text document. Existing methods for single document summarization and keyphrase extraction usually make use of only the information contained in the specified document. This article proposes using a small number of nearest neighbor documents to improve document summarization and keyphrase extraction for the specified document, under the assumption that the neighbor documents could provide additional knowledge and more clues. The specified document is expanded to a small document set by adding a few neighbor documents close to the document, and the graph-based ranking algorithm is then applied on the expanded document set to make use of both the local information in the specified document and the global information in the neighbor documents. Experimental results on the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approaches. The cross-document sentence relationships in the expanded document set are validated to be beneficial to single document summarization, and the word cooccurrence relationships in the neighbor documents are validated to be very helpful to single document keyphrase extraction.},

abstract = {Numerous techniques have been proposed in the past for supporting efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries in continuous data spaces. Limited work has been reported in the literature for k-NN queries in a nonordered discrete data space (NDDS). Performing k-NN queries in an NDDS raises new challenges. The Hamming distance is usually used to measure the distance between two vectors (objects) in an NDDS. Due to the coarse granularity of the Hamming distance, a k-NN query in an NDDS may lead to a high degree of nondeterminism for the query result. We propose a new distance measure, called Granularity-Enhanced Hamming (GEH) distance, which effectively reduces the number of candidate solutions for a query. We have also implemented k-NN queries using multidimensional database indexing in NDDSs. Further, we use the properties of our multidimensional NDDS index to derive the probability of encountering valid neighbors within specific regions of the index. This probability is used to develop a new search ordering heuristic. Our experiments on synthetic and genomic data sets demonstrate that our index-based k-NN algorithm is efficient in finding k-NNs in both uniform and nonuniform data sets in NDDSs and that our heuristics are effective in improving the performance of such queries.},

Previous work on query suggestion has been limited to the same language. In this article, we extend it to cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS): for a query in one language, we suggest similar or relevant queries in other languages. This is very important to the scenarios of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and other related cross-lingual applications. Instead of relying on existing query translation technologies for CLQS, we present an effective means to map the input query of one language to queries of the other language in the query log. Important monolingual and cross-lingual information such as word translation relations and word co-occurrence statistics, and so on, are used to estimate the cross-lingual query similarity with a discriminative model. Benchmarks show that the resulting CLQS system significantly outperforms a baseline system that uses dictionary-based query translation. Besides, we evaluate CLQS with French-English and Chinese-English CLIR tasks on TREC-6 and NTCIR-4 collections, respectively. The CLIR experiments using typical retrieval models demonstrate that the CLQS-based approach has significantly higher effectiveness than several traditional query translation methods. We find that when combined with pseudo-relevance feedback, the effectiveness of CLIR using CLQS is enhanced for different pairs of languages.},

abstract = {This article introduces an architecture for a document-partitioned search engine, based on a novel approach combining collection selection and load balancing, called load-driven routing. By exploiting the query-vector document model, and the incremental caching technique, our architecture can compute very high quality results for any query, with only a fraction of the computational load used in a typical document-partitioned architecture. By trading off a small fraction of the results, our technique allows us to strongly reduce the computing pressure to a search engine back-end; we are able to retrieve more than 2/3 of the top-5 results for a given query with only 10% the computing load needed by a configuration where the query is processed by each index partition. Alternatively, we can slightly increase the load up to 25% to improve precision and get more than 80% of the top-5 results. In fact, the flexibility of our system allows a wide range of different configurations, so as to easily respond to different needs in result quality or restrictions in computing power. More important, the system configuration can be adjusted dynamically in order to fit unexpected query peaks or unpredictable failures. This article wraps up some recent works by the authors, showing the results obtained by tests conducted on 6 million documents, 2,800,000 queries and real query cost timing as measured on an actual index.},

The probability distribution over topics in a multi-author paper is a mixture of the distributions associated with the authors. The topic-word and author-topic distributions are learned from data in an unsupervised manner using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply the methodology to three large text corpora: 150,000 abstracts from the CiteSeer digital library, 1740 papers from the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Conferences, and 121,000 emails from the Enron corporation. We discuss in detail the interpretation of the results discovered by the system including specific topic and author models, ranking of authors by topic and topics by author, parsing of abstracts by topics and authors, and detection of unusual papers by specific authors. Experiments based on perplexity scores for test documents and precision-recall for document retrieval are used to illustrate systematic differences between the proposed author-topic model and a number of alternatives. Extensions to the model, allowing for example, generalizations of the notion of an author, are also briefly discussed.},

The backbone of the proposed framework for the semantic clustering of XML documents is a data representation model that exploits the notion of tree tuple to identify semantically cohesive substructures in XML documents and represent them as transactional data. This framework is equipped with two clustering algorithms based on different paradigms, namely centroid-based partitional clustering and frequent-itemset-based hierarchical clustering. An extensive experimental evaluation was conducted on real data sets from various domains, showing the significance of our approach as a solution for the semantic clustering of XML documents.},

In this statistical lattice-based retrieval (SLBR) method, a smoothed statistical model is estimated for each document from the expected counts of words given the information in a lattice, and the relevance of each document to a query is measured as a probability under such a model. We investigate the efficacy of our method under various parameter settings of the speech recognition and lattice processing engines, using the Fisher English Corpus of conversational telephone speech. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves better retrieval performance than using only the 1-best transcripts in statistical retrieval, outperforms a recently proposed lattice-based vector space retrieval method, and also compares favorably with a lattice-based retrieval method based on the Okapi BM25 model.},

abstract = {Information retrieval (IR) systems typically compress their indexes in order to increase their efficiency. Static pruning is a form of lossy data compression: it removes from the index, data that is estimated to be the least important to retrieval performance, according to some criterion. Generally, pruning criteria are derived from term weighting functions, which assign weights to terms according to their contribution to a document's contents. Usually, document-term occurrences that are assigned a low weight are ruled out from the index. The main assumption is that those entries contribute little to the document content.We present a novel pruning technique that is based on a probabilistic model of IR. We employ the Probability Ranking Principle as a decision criterion over which posting list entries are to be pruned. The proposed approach requires the estimation of three probabilities, combining them in such a way that we gather all the necessary information to apply the aforementioned criterion.We evaluate our proposed pruning technique on five TREC collections and various retrieval tasks, and show that in almost every situation it outperforms the state of the art in index pruning. The main contribution of this work is proposing a pruning technique that stems directly from the same source as probabilistic retrieval models, and hence is independent of the final model used for retrieval.},

abstract = {Web recommender systems are Web applications capable of generating useful suggestions for visitors of Internet sites. However, in the case of large user communities and in presence of a high number of Web sites, these tasks are computationally onerous, even more if the client software runs on devices with limited resources. Moreover, the quality of the recommendations strictly depends on how the recommendation algorithm takes into account the currently used device. Some approaches proposed in the literature provide multidimensional recommendations considering, besides items and users, also the exploited device. However, these systems do not efficiently perform, since they assign to either the client or the server the arduous cost of computing recommendations. In this article, we argue that a fully distributed organization is a suitable solution to improve the efficiency of multidimensional recommender systems. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel distributed architecture, called MUADDIB, where each user's device is provided with a device assistant that autonomously retrieves information about the user's behavior. Moreover, a single profiler, associated with the user, periodically collects information coming from the different user's device assistants to construct a global user's profile. In order to generate recommendations, a recommender precomputes data provided by the profilers. This way, the site manager has only the task of suitably presenting the content of the site, while the computation of the recommendations is assigned to the other distributed components. Some experiments conducted on real data and using some well-known metrics show that the system works more effectively and efficiently than other device-based distributed recommenders.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web provides an abundant source of medical information. This information can assist people who are not healthcare professionals to better understand health and illness, and to provide them with feasible explanations for symptoms. However, the Web has the potential to increase the anxieties of people who have little or no medical training, especially when Web search is employed as a diagnostic procedure. We use the term cyberchondria to refer to the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomatology, based on the review of search results and literature on the Web. We performed a large-scale, longitudinal, log-based study of how people search for medical information online, supported by a survey of 515 individuals' health-related search experiences. We focused on the extent to which common, likely innocuous symptoms can escalate into the review of content on serious, rare conditions that are linked to the common symptoms. Our results show that Web search engines have the potential to escalate medical concerns. We show that escalation is associated with the amount and distribution of medical content viewed by users, the presence of escalatory terminology in pages visited, and a user's predisposition to escalate versus to seek more reasonable explanations for ailments. We also demonstrate the persistence of postsession anxiety following escalations and the effect that such anxieties can have on interrupting user's activities across multiple sessions. Our findings underscore the potential costs and challenges of cyberchondria and suggest actionable design implications that hold opportunity for improving the search and navigation experience for people turning to the Web to interpret common symptoms.},

abstract = {A new principles framework is presented for retrieval evaluation of ranked outputs. It applies decision theory to model relevance decision preferences and shows that the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) specifies optimal ranking. It has two new components, namely a probabilistic evaluation model and a general measure of retrieval effectiveness. Its probabilities may be interpreted as subjective or objective ones. Its performance measure is the expected weighted rank which is the weighted average rank of a retrieval list. Starting from this measure, the expected forward rank and some existing retrieval effectiveness measures (e.g., top n precision and discounted cumulative gain) are instantiated using suitable weighting schemes after making certain assumptions. The significance of these instantiations is that the ranking prescribed by PRP is shown to be optimal simultaneously for all these existing performance measures. In addition, the optimal expected weighted rank may be used to normalize the expected weighted rank of retrieval systems for (summary) performance comparison (across different topics) between systems. The framework also extends PRP and our evaluation model to handle graded relevance, thereby generalizing the discussed, existing measures (e.g., top n precision) and probabilistic retrieval models for graded relevance.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been explosive growth in the availability of multimedia data, particularly image, video, and music. Because of this, content-based music retrieval has attracted attention from the multimedia database and information retrieval communities. Content-based music retrieval requires us to be able to automatically identify particular characteristics of music data. One such characteristic, useful in a range of applications, is the identification of the singer in a musical piece. Unfortunately, existing approaches to this problem suffer from either low accuracy or poor scalability. In this article, we propose a novel scheme, called Hybrid Singer Identifier (HSI), for efficient automated singer recognition. HSI uses multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal and nonvocal music segments to enhance the identification process; it achieves this via a hybrid architecture that builds profiles of individual singer characteristics based on statistical mixture models. An extensive experimental study on a large music database demonstrates the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and robustness.},

abstract = {Recently, video clips have become very popular online. The massive influx of video clips has created an urgent need for video search engines to facilitate retrieving relevant clips. Different from traditional long videos, a video clip is a short video often expressing a moment of significance. Due to the high complexity of video data, efficient video clip search from large databases turns out to be very challenging. We propose a novel video clip representation model called the Bounded Coordinate System (BCS), which is the first single representative capturing the dominating content and content—changing trends of a video clip. It summarizes a video clip by a coordinate system, where each of its coordinate axes is identified by principal component analysis (PCA) and bounded by the range of data projections along the axis. The similarity measure of BCS considers the operations of translation, rotation, and scaling for coordinate system matching. Particularly, rotation and scaling reflect the difference of content tendencies. Compared with the quadratic time complexity of existing methods, the time complexity of measuring BCS similarity is linear. The compact video representation together with its linear similarity measure makes real-time search from video clip collections feasible. To further improve the retrieval efficiency for large video databases, a two-dimensional transformation method called Bidistance Transformation (BDT) is introduced to utilize a pair of optimal reference points with respect to bidirectional axes in BCS. Our extensive performance study on a large database of more than 30,000 video clips demonstrates that BCS achieves very high search accuracy according to human judgment. This indicates that content tendencies are important in determining the meanings of video clips and confirms that BCS can capture the inherent moment of video clip to some extent that better resembles human perception. In addition, BDT outperforms existing indexing methods greatly. Integration of the BCS model and BDT indexing can achieve real-time search from large video clip databases.},

abstract = {Support vector machine (SVM) active learning is one popular and successful technique for relevance feedback in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Despite the success, conventional SVM active learning has two main drawbacks. First, the performance of SVM is usually limited by the number of labeled examples. It often suffers a poor performance for the small-sized labeled examples, which is the case in relevance feedback. Second, conventional approaches do not take into account the redundancy among examples, and could select multiple examples that are similar (or even identical). In this work, we propose a novel scheme for explicitly addressing the drawbacks. It first learns a kernel function from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data, and therefore alleviates the problem of small-sized training data. The kernel will then be used for a batch mode active learning method to identify the most informative and diverse examples via a min-max framework. Two novel algorithms are proposed to solve the related combinatorial optimization: the first approach approximates the problem into a quadratic program, and the second solves the combinatorial optimization approximately by a greedy algorithm that exploits the merits of submodular functions. Extensive experiments with image retrieval using both natural photo images and medical images show that the proposed algorithms are significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches.

abstract = {While navigation within complex information spaces is a problem for all users, the problem is most evident with individuals who are blind who cannot simply locate, point, and click on a link in hypertext documents with a mouse. Users who are blind have to listen searching for the link in the document using only the keyboard and a screen reader program, which may be particularly inefficient in large documents with many links or deep hierarchies that are hard to navigate. Consequently, they are especially penalized when the information being searched is hidden under multiple layers of indirections. In this article, we introduce a segment-enrich-annotate (SEA) paradigm for adapting digital content with deep structures for improved accessibility. In particular, we instantiate and evaluate this paradigm through the iCare-Assistant, an assistive system for helping students who are blind in accessing Web and electronic course materials. Our evaluations, involving the participation of students who are blind, showed that the iCare-Assistant system, built based on the SEA paradigm, reduces the navigational overhead significantly and enables user who are blind access complex online course servers effectively.},

Such metasearch provides a mechanism for locating documents on the hidden Web and, by use of sampling, can proceed even when the collections are uncooperative. However, the similarity scores for documents returned from different collections are not comparable, and, in uncooperative environments, document scores are unlikely to be reported. We introduce a new merging method for uncooperative environments, in which similarity scores for the sampled documents held for each collection are used to estimate global scores for the documents returned per query. This method requires no assumptions about properties such as the retrieval models used. Using experiments on a wide range of collections, we show that in many cases our merging methods are significantly more effective than previous techniques.},

However, most previous work on language models for information retrieval focused on document-specific characteristics, and therefore did not take into account the structure of the surrounding corpus, a potentially rich source of additional information. We propose a novel algorithmic framework in which information provided by document-based language models is enhanced by the incorporation of information drawn from clusters of similar documents. Using this framework, we develop a suite of new algorithms. Even the simplest typically outperforms the standard language-modeling approach in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and recall, and our new interpolation algorithm posts statistically significant performance improvements for both metrics over all six corpora tested. An important aspect of our work is the way we model corpus structure. In contrast to most previous work on cluster-based retrieval that partitions the corpus, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple strategy based on a nearest-neighbors approach that produces overlapping clusters.},

abstract = {Traditional personalized search approaches rely solely on individual profiles to construct a user model. They are often confronted by two major problems: data sparseness and cold-start for new individuals. Data sparseness refers to the fact that most users only visit a small portion of Web pages and hence a very sparse user-term relationship matrix is generated, while cold-start for new individuals means that the system cannot conduct any personalization without previous browsing history. Recently, community-based approaches were proposed to use the group's social behaviors as a supplement to personalization. However, these approaches only consider the commonality of a group of users and still cannot satisfy the diverse information needs of different users. In this article, we present a new approach, called collaborative personalized search. It considers not only the commonality factor among users for defining group user profiles and global user profiles, but also the specialties of individuals. Then, a statistical user language model is proposed to integrate the individual model, group user model and global user model together. In this way, the probability that a user will like a Web page is calculated through a two-step smoothing mechanism. First, a global user model is used to smooth the probability of unseen terms in the individual profiles and provide aggregated behavior of global users. Then, in order to precisely describe individual interests by looking at the behaviors of similar users, users are clustered into groups and group-user models are constructed. The group-user models are integrated into an overall model through a cluster-based language model. The behaviors of the group users can be utilized to enhance the performance of personalized search. This model can alleviate the two aforementioned problems and provide a more effective personalized search than previous approaches. Large-scale experimental evaluations are conducted to show that the proposed approach substantially improves the relevance of a search over several competitive methods.},

abstract = {When an event occurs, it attracts attention of information sources to publish related documents along its lifespan. The task of event detection is to automatically identify events and their related documents from a document stream, which is a set of chronologically ordered documents collected from various information sources. Generally, each event has a distinct activeness development so that its status changes continuously during its lifespan. When an event is active, there are a lot of related documents from various information sources. In contrast when it is inactive, there are very few documents, but they are focused. Previous works on event detection did not consider the characteristics of the event's activeness, and used rigid thresholds for event detection. We propose a concept called life profile, modeled by a hidden Markov model, to model the activeness trends of events. In addition, a general event detection framework, LIPED, which utilizes the learned life profiles and the burst-and-diverse characteristic to adjust the event detection thresholds adaptively, can be incorporated into existing event detection methods. Based on the official TDT corpus and contest rules, the evaluation results show that existing detection methods that incorporate LIPED achieve better performance in the cost and F1 metrics, than without.},

Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and cooccurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.},

This facilitates the creative process of information discovery, in which humans develop new ideas while finding and collecting information. To provoke the user to think about the large space of potentially relevant information resources, a generative agent proactively engages in collecting information resources, forming image and text surrogates, and composing them visually. The agent develops the collection and its visual representation over time, enabling the user to see ideas and relationships. To keep the human in control, we develop interactive mechanisms for authoring the composition and directing the agent.

We evaluate our proposed framework, using actual complaint feedback from a large population of users, and validate its spam-filtering performance on a collection of real email traffic over several weeks.

abstract = {A range of methods for measuring the effectiveness of information retrieval systems has been proposed. These are typically intended to provide a quantitative single-value summary of a document ranking relative to a query. However, many of these measures have failings. For example, recall is not well founded as a measure of satisfaction, since the user of an actual system cannot judge recall. Average precision is derived from recall, and suffers from the same problem. In addition, average precision lacks key stability properties that are needed for robust experiments. In this article, we introduce a new effectiveness metric, rank-biased precision, that avoids these problems. Rank-biased pre-cision is derived from a simple model of user behavior, is robust if answer rankings are extended to greater depths, and allows accurate quantification of experimental uncertainty, even when only partial relevance judgments are available.},

abstract = {In information retrieval research, comparing retrieval approaches requires test collections consisting of documents, user requests and relevance assessments. Obtaining relevance assessments that are as sound and complete as possible is crucial for the comparison of retrieval approaches. In XML retrieval, the problem of obtaining sound and complete relevance assessments is further complicated by the structural relationships between retrieval results.A major difference between XML retrieval and flat document retrieval is that the relevance of elements (the retrievable units) is not independent of that of related elements. This has major consequences for the gathering of relevance assessments. This article describes investigations into the creation of sound and complete relevance assessments for the evaluation of content-oriented XML retrieval as carried out at INEX, the evaluation campaign for XML retrieval. The campaign, now in its seventh year, has had three substantially different approaches to gather assessments and has finally settled on a highlighting method for marking relevant passages within documents—even though the objective is to collect assessments at element level. The different methods of gathering assessments at INEX are discussed and contrasted. The highlighting method is shown to be the most reliable of the methods.},

abstract = {In this article we investigate information scraps—personal information where content has been scribbled on Post-it notes, scrawled on the corners of sheets of paper, stuck in our pockets, sent in email messages to ourselves, and stashed in miscellaneous digital text files. Information scraps encode information ranging from ideas and sketches to notes, reminders, shipment tracking numbers, driving directions, and even poetry. Although information scraps are ubiquitous, we have much still to learn about these loose forms of information practice. Why do we keep information scraps outside of our traditional PIM applications? What role do information scraps play in our overall information practice? How might PIM applications be better designed to accommodate and support information scraps' creation, manipulation and retrieval?We pursued these questions by studying the information scrap practices of 27 knowledge workers at five organizations. Our observations shed light on information scraps' content, form, media, and location. From this data, we elaborate on the typical information scrap lifecycle, and identify common roles that information scraps play: temporary storage, archiving, work-in-progress, reminding, and management of unusual data. These roles suggest a set of unmet design needs in current PIM tools: lightweight entry, unconstrained content, flexible use and adaptability, visibility, and mobility.},

abstract = {This article deals with the organization and management of the computer files handled by mechanical engineers on their personal computers. In engineering organizations, a wide variety of electronic files (documents) are necessary to support both business processes and the activities of design and manufacture. Whilst a large number of files and hence information is formally archived, a significant amount of additional information and knowledge resides in electronic files on personal computers. The widespread use of these personal information stores means that all information is retained. However, its reuse is problematic for all but the individual as a result of the naming and organization of the files. To begin to address this issue, a study of the use and current practices for managing personal electronic files is described. The study considers the fundamental classes of files handled by engineers and analyses the organization of these files across the personal computers of 40 participants. The study involves a questionnaire and an electronic audit. The results of these qualitative and quantitative elements are used to elicit an understanding of the practices and requirements of engineers for managing personal electronic files. A potential scheme for naming and organizing personal electronic files is discussed as one possible way to satisfy these requirements. The aim of the scheme is to balance the personal nature of data storage with the need for personal records to be shared with others to support knowledge reuse in engineering organizations. Although this article is concerned with mechanical engineers, the issues dealt with are relevant to knowledge-based industries and, in particular, teams of knowledge workers.},

High accuracy of the corresponding supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) methods is achieved by restrictively leaving out uncertain documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate topics or clusters with low confidence. We introduce a formal probabilistic model for the resulting ensemble based meta methods and explain how it can be used for constructing estimators and for goal-oriented tuning.

abstract = {When a person issues a query, that person has expectations about the search results that will be returned. These expectations can be based on the current information need, but are also influenced by how the searcher believes the search engine works, where relevant results are expected to be ranked, and any previous searches the individual has run on the topic. This paper looks in depth at how the expectations people develop about search result lists during an initial query affect their perceptions of and interactions with future repeat search result lists. Three studies are presented that give insight into how people recall, recognize, and reuse results. The first study (a study of recall) explores what people recall about previously viewed search result lists. The second study (a study of recognition) builds on the first to reveal that people often recognize a result list as one they have seen before even when it is quite different. As long as those aspects that the searcher remembers about the initial list remain the same, other aspects can change significantly. This is advantageous because, as the third study (a study of reuse) shows, when a result list appears to have changed, people have trouble re-using the previously viewed content in the list. They are less likely to find what they are looking for, less happy with the result quality, more likely to find the task hard, and more likely to take a long time searching. Although apparent consistency is important for reuse, people's inability to recognize change makes consistency without stagnation possible. New relevant results can be presented where old results have been forgotten, making both old and new content easy to find.},

abstract = {Although the seminal proposal to introduce language modeling in information retrieval was based on a multivariate Bernoulli model, the predominant modeling approach is now centered on multinomial models. Language modeling for retrieval based on multivariate Bernoulli distributions is seen inefficient and believed less effective than the multinomial model. In this article, we examine the multivariate Bernoulli model with respect to its successor and examine its role in future retrieval systems. In the context of Bayesian learning, these two modeling approaches are described, contrasted, and compared both theoretically and computationally. We show that the query likelihood following a multivariate Bernoulli distribution introduces interesting retrieval features which may be useful for specific retrieval tasks such as sentence retrieval. Then, we address the efficiency aspect and show that algorithms can be designed to perform retrieval efficiently for multivariate Bernoulli models, before performing an empirical comparison to study the behaviorial aspects of the models. A series of comparisons is then conducted on a number of test collections and retrieval tasks to determine the empirical and practical differences between the different models. Our results indicate that for sentence retrieval the multivariate Bernoulli model can significantly outperform the multinomial model. However, for the other tasks the multinomial model provides consistently better performance (and in most cases significantly so). An analysis of the various retrieval characteristics reveals that the multivariate Bernoulli model tends to promote long documents whose nonquery terms are informative. While this is detrimental to the task of document retrieval (documents tend to contain considerable nonquery content), it is valuable for other tasks such as sentence retrieval, where the retrieved elements are very short and focused.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering aims at predicting a user's interest for a given item based on a collection of user profiles. This article views collaborative filtering as a problem highly related to information retrieval, drawing an analogy between the concepts of users and items in recommender systems and queries and documents in text retrieval.We present a probabilistic user-to-item relevance framework that introduces the concept of relevance into the related problem of collaborative filtering. Three different models are derived, namely, a user-based, an item-based, and a unified relevance model, and we estimate their rating predictions from three sources: the user's own ratings for different items, other users' ratings for the same item, and ratings from different but similar users for other but similar items.To reduce the data sparsity encountered when estimating the probability density function of the relevance variable, we apply the nonparametric (data-driven) density estimation technique known as the Parzen-window method (or kernel-based density estimation). Using a Gaussian window function, the similarity between users and/or items would, however, be based on Euclidean distance. Because the collaborative filtering literature has reported improved prediction accuracy when using cosine similarity, we generalize the Parzen-window method by introducing a projection kernel.Existing user-based and item-based approaches correspond to two simplified instantiations of our framework. User-based and item-based collaborative filterings represent only a partial view of the prediction problem, where the unified relevance model brings these partial views together under the same umbrella. Experimental results complement the theoretical insights with improved recommendation accuracy. The unified model is more robust to data sparsity because the different types of ratings are used in concert.},

The new inverted file incorporates cluster membership and centroid information along with the usual document information into a single structure. In our incremental-CBR strategy, during query evaluation, both best(-matching) clusters and the best(-matching) documents of such clusters are computed together with a single posting-list access per query term. As we switch from term to term, the best clusters are recomputed and can dynamically change. During query-document matching, only relevant portions of the posting lists corresponding to the best clusters are considered and the rest are skipped. The proposed approach is essentially tailored for environments where inverted files are compressed, and provides substantial efficiency improvement while yielding comparable, or sometimes better, effectiveness figures. Our experiments with various collections show that the incremental-CBR strategy using a compressed cluster-skipping inverted file significantly improves CPU time efficiency, regardless of query length. The new compressed inverted file imposes an acceptable storage overhead in comparison to a typical inverted file. We also show that our approach scales well with the collection size.},

abstract = {A novel probabilistic retrieval model is presented. It forms a basis to interpret the TF-IDF term weights as making relevance decisions. It simulates the local relevance decision-making for every location of a document, and combines all of these “local” relevance decisions as the “document-wide” relevance decision for the document. The significance of interpreting TF-IDF in this way is the potential to: (1) establish a unifying perspective about information retrieval as relevance decision-making; and (2) develop advanced TF-IDF-related term weights for future elaborate retrieval models. Our novel retrieval model is simplified to a basic ranking formula that directly corresponds to the TF-IDF term weights. In general, we show that the term-frequency factor of the ranking formula can be rendered into different term-frequency factors of existing retrieval systems. In the basic ranking formula, the remaining quantity - log p(r¯|t ∈ d) is interpreted as the probability of randomly picking a nonrelevant usage (denoted by r¯) of term t. Mathematically, we show that this quantity can be approximated by the inverse document-frequency (IDF). Empirically, we show that this quantity is related to IDF, using four reference TREC ad hoc retrieval data collections.},

First, basic ranking techniques, which are based on various file features (e.g., file name, access date, file size, etc.), are considered and their effectiveness is empirically analyzed. Next, two learning-based ranking schemes are presented, and are shown to be significantly more effective than the basic ranking methods. Finally, a novel ranking technique, based on query selectiveness, is considered for use during the cold-start period of the system. This method is also shown to be empirically effective, even though it does not involve any learning.},

abstract = {Link-based ranking algorithms are among the most important techniques to improve web search. In particular, the PageRank algorithm has been successfully used in the Google search engine and has been attracting much attention recently. However, we find that PageRank has a “zero-one gap” problem which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed in any previous work. This problem can be potentially exploited to spam PageRank results and make the state-of-the-art link-based antispamming techniques ineffective. The zero-one gap problem arises as a result of the current ad hoc way of computing transition probabilities in the random surfing model. We therefore propose a novel DirichletRank algorithm which calculates these probabilities using Bayesian estimation with a Dirichlet prior. DirichletRank is a variant of PageRank, but does not have the problem of zero-one gap and can be analytically shown substantially more resistant to some link spams than PageRank. Experiment results on TREC data show that DirichletRank can achieve better retrieval accuracy than PageRank due to its more reasonable allocation of transition probabilities. More importantly, experiments on the TREC dataset and another real web dataset from the Webgraph project show that, compared with the original PageRank, DirichletRank is more stable under link perturbation and is significantly more robust against both manually identified web spams and several simulated link spams. DirichletRank can be computed as efficiently as PageRank, and thus is scalable to large-scale web applications.},

We use this new approach to propose and experiment on simple and effective pruning methods that allow a fast construction of the pruned index. The methods proposed here are especially useful for pruning in environments where the document database changes continuously, such as large-scale web search engines. Extensive experiments are presented showing that the proposed methods can achieve high compression rates while maintaining the quality of results for the most common query types present in modern search engines, namely, conjunctive and phrase queries. In the experiments, our locality-based pruning approach allowed reducing search engine indices to 30% of their original size, with almost no reduction in precision at the top answers. Furthermore, we conclude that even an extremely simple locality-based pruning method can be competitive when compared to complex methods that do not rely on locality information.},

abstract = {In an adaptive information retrieval (IR) setting, the information seekers' beliefs about which terms are relevant or nonrelevant will naturally fluctuate. This article investigates how the theory of belief revision can be used to model adaptive IR. More specifically, belief revision logic provides a rich representation scheme to formalize retrieval contexts so as to disambiguate vague user queries. In addition, belief revision theory underpins the development of an effective mechanism to revise user profiles in accordance with information seekers' changing information needs. It is argued that information retrieval contexts can be extracted by means of the information-flow text mining method so as to realize a highly autonomous adaptive IR system. The extra bonus of a belief-based IR model is that its retrieval behavior is more predictable and explanatory. Our initial experiments show that the belief-based adaptive IR system is as effective as a classical adaptive IR system. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful implementation and evaluation of a logic-based adaptive IR model which can efficiently process large IR collections.},

abstract = {One of the problems often associated with online anonymity is that it hinders social accountability, as substantiated by the high levels of cybercrime. Although identity cues are scarce in cyberspace, individuals often leave behind textual identity traces. In this study we proposed the use of stylometric analysis techniques to help identify individuals based on writing style. We incorporated a rich set of stylistic features, including lexical, syntactic, structural, content-specific, and idiosyncratic attributes. We also developed the Writeprints technique for identification and similarity detection of anonymous identities. Writeprints is a Karhunen-Loeve transforms-based technique that uses a sliding window and pattern disruption algorithm with individual author-level feature sets. The Writeprints technique and extended feature set were evaluated on a testbed encompassing four online datasets spanning different domains: email, instant messaging, feedback comments, and program code. Writeprints outperformed benchmark techniques, including SVM, Ensemble SVM, PCA, and standard Karhunen-Loeve transforms, on the identification and similarity detection tasks with accuracy as high as 94% when differentiating between 100 authors. The extended feature set also significantly outperformed a baseline set of features commonly used in previous research. Furthermore, individual-author-level feature sets generally outperformed use of a single group of attributes.},

abstract = {Many valuable text databases on the web have noncrawlable contents that are “hidden” behind search interfaces. Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over multiple such “hidden-web” text databases at once through a unified query interface. An important step in the metasearching process is database selection, or determining which databases are the most relevant for a given user query. The state-of-the-art database selection techniques rely on statistical summaries of the database contents, generally including the database vocabulary and associated word frequencies. Unfortunately, hidden-web text databases typically do not export such summaries, so previous research has developed algorithms for constructing approximate content summaries from document samples extracted from the databases via querying. We present a novel “focused-probing” sampling algorithm that detects the topics covered in a database and adaptively extracts documents that are representative of the topic coverage of the database. Our algorithm is the first to construct content summaries that include the frequencies of the words in the database. Unfortunately, Zipf's law practically guarantees that for any relatively large database, content summaries built from moderately sized document samples will fail to cover many low-frequency words; in turn, incomplete content summaries might negatively affect the database selection process, especially for short queries with infrequent words. To enhance the sparse document samples and improve the database selection decisions, we exploit the fact that topically similar databases tend to have similar vocabularies, so samples extracted from databases with a similar topical focus can complement each other. We have developed two database selection algorithms that exploit this observation. The first algorithm proceeds hierarchically and selects the best categories for a query, and then sends the query to the appropriate databases in the chosen categories. The second algorithm uses “shrinkage,” a statistical technique for improving parameter estimation in the face of sparse data, to enhance the database content summaries with category-specific words. We describe how to modify existing database selection algorithms to adaptively decide (at runtime) whether shrinkage is beneficial for a query. A thorough evaluation over a variety of databases, including 315 real web databases as well as TREC data, suggests that the proposed sampling methods generate high-quality content summaries and that the database selection algorithms produce significantly more relevant database selection decisions and overall search results than existing algorithms.},

The results suggest that moderate error correction does not yield statistically significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness when indexing and searching using n-grams.

CF is used by numerous e-commerce Web sites for providing personalized recommendations. Although much research has focused on refining collaborative filtering algorithms, little is known about the effects of user and domain characteristics on the accuracy of collaborative filtering systems. In this study, the effects of two factors—product domain and users' search mode—on the accuracy of CF are investigated. The effects of those factors are tested using data collected from two experiments in two different product domains, and from two large CF datasets, EachMovie and Book-Crossing. The study shows that the search mode of the users strongly influences the accuracy of the recommendations. CF works better when users look for specific information than when they search for general information. The accuracy drops significantly when data from different modes are mixed. The study also shows that CF is more accurate for knowledge domains than for consumer product domains. The results of this study imply that for more accurate recommendations, collaborative filtering systems should be able to identify and handle users' mode of search, even within the same domain and user group.},

These digital contents are automatically managed by different kinds of digital library management systems and more generally by different kinds of information management systems.Even though this topic has already been partially studied by other researchers, the previous research work on annotations has left many open issues. These issues concern the lack of clarity about what an annotation is, what its features are, and how it is used. These issues are mainly due to the fact that models and systems for annotations have only been developed for specific purposes. As a result, there is only a fragmentary picture of the annotation and its management, and this is tied to specific contexts of use and lacks-general validity.The aim of the article is to provide a unified and integrated picture of the annotation, ranging from defining what an annotation is to providing a formal model. The key ideas of the model are: the distinction between the meaning and the sign of the annotation, which represent the semantics and the materialization of an annotation, respectively; the clear formalization of the temporal dimension involved with annotations; and the introduction of a distributed hypertext between digital contents and annotations. Therefore, the proposed formal model captures both syntactic and semantic aspects of the annotations. Furthermore, it is built on previously existing models and may be seen as an extension of them.},

The effectiveness of the technique called frequency-based identification of translation equivalents (FITE) was tested using biological and medical cross-lingual spelling variants and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in Spanish-English and Finnish-English TRT. The results showed that, depending on the source language and frequency corpus, FITE-TRT (the identification of translation equivalents from TRT's translation set by means of the FITE technique) may achieve high translation recall. In the case of the Web as the frequency corpus, translation recall was 89.2%--91.0% for Spanish-English FITE-TRT. For both language pairs FITE-TRT achieved high translation precision: 95.0%--98.8%. The technique also reliably identified native source language words: source words that cannot be correctly translated by TRT. Dictionary-based CLIR augmented with FITE-TRT performed substantially better than basic dictionary-based CLIR where OOV keys were kept intact. FITE-TRT with Web document frequencies was the best technique among several fuzzy translation/matching approaches tested in cross-language retrieval experiments. We also discuss the application of FITE-TRT in the automatic construction of multilingual dictionaries.},

abstract = {In dynamic environments, such as the World Wide Web, a changing document collection, query population, and set of search services demands frequent repetition of search effectiveness (relevance) evaluations. Reconstructing static test collections, such as in TREC, requires considerable human effort, as large collection sizes demand judgments deep into retrieved pools. In practice it is common to perform shallow evaluations over small numbers of live engines (often pairwise, engine A vs. engine B) without system pooling. Although these evaluations are not intended to construct reusable test collections, their utility depends on conclusions generalizing to the query population as a whole. We leverage the bootstrap estimate of the reproducibility probability of hypothesis tests in determining the query sample sizes required to ensure this, finding they are much larger than those required for static collections. We propose a semiautomatic evaluation framework to reduce this effort. We validate this framework against a manual evaluation of the top ten results of ten Web search engines across 896 queries in navigational and informational tasks. Augmenting manual judgments with pseudo-relevance judgments mined from Web taxonomies reduces both the chances of missing a correct pairwise conclusion, and those of finding an errant conclusion, by approximately 50%.},

Each page is associated with a weight representing the frequency with which that page is accessed by users. In the tree hierarchy representation, accessing each page requires the user to travel along the path leading to it from the root. By enhancing the index tree with additional edges (hotlinks) one may reduce the access cost of the system. In other words, the hotlinks reduce the expected number of steps needed to reach a leaf page from the tree root, assuming that the user knows which hotlinks to take. The hotlink enhancement problem involves finding a set of hotlinks minimizing this cost.This article proposes the first exact algorithm for the hotlink enhancement problem. This algorithm runs in polynomial time for trees with logarithmic depth. Experiments conducted with real data show that significant improvement in the expected number of accesses per search can be achieved in websites using this algorithm. These experiments also suggest that the simple and much faster heuristic proposed previously by Czyzowicz et al. [2003] creates hotlinks that are nearly optimal in the time savings they provide to the user.The version of the hotlink enhancement problem in which the weight distribution on the leaves is unknown is discussed as well.

On the model side, common music information retrieval methods do not take into account the inner structure of melodic themes and the metric relationships between notes.In this article we deal with two main topics: a novel architecture based on a new XML language for music and a new model of melodic themes based on graph theory.This model takes advantage of particular graph invariants that can be linked to melodic themes as metadata in order to characterize all their possible modifications through specific transformations and that can be exploited in filtering algorithms. We provide a similarity function and show through an evaluation stage how it improves existing methods, particularly in the case of same-structured themes.},

In the absence of extensive linguistic resources for certain languages, statistical language processing tools have been successfully used to improve the performance of IR systems. In this article, we describe a clustering-based approach to discover equivalence classes of root words and their morphological variants. A set of string distance measures are defined, and the lexicon for a given text collection is clustered using the distance measures to identify these equivalence classes. The proposed approach is compared with Porter's and Lovin's stemmers on the AP and WSJ subcollections of the Tipster dataset using 200 queries. Its performance is comparable to that of Porter's and Lovin's stemmers, both in terms of average precision and the total number of relevant documents retrieved.

With hundreds of online services provided through a web portal, it is critical to design web portals, namely service portals, through which online services can be easily accessed by their consumers. This article addresses this critical issue from the perspective of service selection, that is, how to select a small number of service-links (i.e., hyperlinks pointing to online services) to be featured in the homepage of a service portal such that users can be directed to find the online services they seek most effectively. We propose a mathematically formulated metric to measure the effectiveness of the selected service-links in directing users to locate their desired online services and formally define the service selection problem. A solution method, ServiceFinder, is then proposed. Using real-world data obtained from the Utah State Government service portal, we show that ServiceFinder outperforms both the current practice of service selection and previous algorithms for adaptive website design. We also show that the performance of ServiceFinder is close to that of the optimal solution resulting from exhaustive search.},

We believe that a wide range of AH techniques can be supported with a small number of OH structures, which can be combined together to create more complex effects, possibly simplifying the development of new AH systems.In this work we reexamine Brusilovsky's taxonomy of AH techniques from a structural OH perspective. We also show that it is possible to identify and model common structures across the taxonomy of adaptive techniques. An agent-based adaptive hypermedia system called HA3L is presented, which uses these OH structures to provide a straightforward implementation of a variety of adaptive hypermedia techniques. This enables us to reflect on the structural equivalence of many of the techniques, demonstrates the advantages of the OH approach, and can inform the design of future adaptive hypermedia systems.},

The timeline for a set of documents returned in response to a query gives an indication of how documents relevant to that query are distributed in time. Examining the timeline of a query result set allows us to characterize both how temporally dependent the topic is, as well as how relevant the results are likely to be. We outline characteristic patterns in query result set timelines, and show experimentally that we can automatically classify documents into these classes. We also show that properties of the query result set timeline can help predict the mean average precision of a query. These results show that meta-features associated with a query can be combined with text retrieval techniques to improve our understanding and treatment of text search on documents with timestamps.},

abstract = {The discovery of a person's meaningful places involves obtaining the physical locations and their labels for a person's places that matter to his daily life and routines. This problem is driven by the requirements from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example, “home”, “work” or “Northwest Health Club”. It is a challenge to map from physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware applications in the dark about their choices.Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale experiment that collected real users' location data and personally meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence that shapes more complex than “points” are required to represent the full range of people's everyday places.},

The physical representation of instance patterns exploits itemsets or association rules to summarize the content of XML datasets. Instance patterns may be used for (possibly partially) answering queries, either when fast and approximate answers are required, or when the actual dataset is not available, for example, it is currently unreachable. Experiments on large XML documents show that instance patterns allow a significant reduction in storage space, while preserving almost entirely the completeness of the query result. Furthermore, they provide fast query answers and show good scalability on the size of the dataset, thus overcoming the document size limitation of most current XQuery engines.},

abstract = {Accurate topical classification of user queries allows for increased effectiveness and efficiency in general-purpose Web search systems. Such classification becomes critical if the system must route queries to a subset of topic-specific and resource-constrained back-end databases. Successful query classification poses a challenging problem, as Web queries are short, thus providing few features. This feature sparseness, coupled with the constantly changing distribution and vocabulary of queries, hinders traditional text classification. We attack this problem by combining multiple classifiers, including exact lookup and partial matching in databases of manually classified frequent queries, linear models trained by supervised learning, and a novel approach based on mining selectional preferences from a large unlabeled query log. Our approach classifies queries without using external sources of information, such as online Web directories or the contents of retrieved pages, making it viable for use in demanding operational environments, such as large-scale Web search services. We evaluate our approach using a large sample of queries from an operational Web search engine and show that our combined method increases recall by nearly 40% over the best single method while maintaining adequate precision. Additionally, we compare our results to those from the 2005 KDD Cup and find that we perform competitively despite our operational restrictions. This suggests it is possible to topically classify a significant portion of the query stream without requiring external sources of information, allowing for deployment in operationally restricted environments.},

Most current systems use regular expression-based hard matching patterns to identify definition sentences. Such rigid surface matching often fares poorly when faced with language variations. We propose two soft matching models to address this problem: one based on bigrams and the other on the Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models provide a theoretically sound method to model pattern matching as a probabilistic process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We show that both models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art manually constructed hard matching patterns on recent TREC data.A critical difference between the two models is that the PHMM has a more complex topology. We experimentally show that the PHMM can handle language variations more effectively but requires more training data to converge.While we evaluate soft pattern models only on definitional question answering, we believe that both models are generic and can be extended to other areas where lexico-syntactic pattern matching can be applied.},

In two sets of controlled experiments, we compare our personalized categorization system (PCAT) with a list interface system (LIST) that mimics a typical search engine and with a nonpersonalized categorization system (CAT). In both experiments, we analyze system performances on the basis of the type of task and query length. We find that PCAT is preferable to LIST for information gathering types of tasks and for searches with short queries, and PCAT outperforms CAT in both information gathering and finding types of tasks, and for searches associated with free-form queries. From the subjects' answers to a questionnaire, we find that PCAT is perceived as a system that can find relevant Web pages quicker and easier than LIST and CAT.},

abstract = {Text queries are natural and intuitive for users to describe their information needs. However, text-based image retrieval faces many challenges. Traditional text retrieval techniques on image descriptions have not been very successful. This is mainly due to the inconsistent textual descriptions and the discrepancies between user queries and terms in the descriptions. To investigate strategies to alleviate this vocabulary problem, this article examines the role of user term feedback in targeted image search that is based on text-based image retrieval. Term feedback refers to the feedback from a user on specific terms regarding their relevance to a target image. Previous studies have indicated the effectiveness of term feedback in interactive text retrieval. However, in our experiments on text-based image retrieval, the term feedback has not been shown to be effective. Our results indicate that, although term feedback has a positive effect by allowing users to identify more relevant terms, it also has a strong negative effect by providing more opportunities for users to specify irrelevant terms. To understand these different effects and their implications, this article further analyzes important factors that contribute to the utility of term feedback and discusses the outlook of term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval.},

Two learning algorithms for learning the similarity information of basic phonemic matching units based on training examples are investigated. By applying the proposed named entity matching model, a mining system is developed for discovering new named entity translations from daily Web news.

Our aim is to provide an evaluation framework that allows the consideration of dependency among XML document components. In particular, two aspects of dependency are considered: (1) near-misses, which are document components that are structurally related to relevant components, such as a neighboring paragraph or container section, and (2) overlap, which regards the situation wherein the same text fragment is referenced multiple times, for example, when a paragraph and its container section are both retrieved. A further consideration is that the measures should be flexible enough so that different models of user behavior may be instantiated within. Both system- and user-oriented aspects are investigated and both recall and precision-like qualities are measured. We evaluate the reliability of the proposed measures based on the INEX 2004 test collection. For example, the effects of assessment variation and topic set size on evaluation stability are investigated, and the upper and lower bounds of expected error rates are established. The evaluation demonstrates that the XCG measures are stable and reliable, and in particular, that the novel measures of effort-precision and gain-recall (ep/gr) show comparable behavior to established IR measures like precision and recall.},

abstract = {XML retrieval is facing new challenges when applied to heterogeneous XML documents, where next to nothing about the document structure can be taken for granted. We have developed solutions where some of the heterogeneity issues are addressed. Our fragment selection algorithm selectively divides a heterogeneous document collection into equi-sized fragments with full-text content. If the content is considered too data-oriented, it is not accepted. The algorithm needs no information about element names. In addition, three techniques for fragment expansion are presented, all of which yield a 13--17% average improvement in average precision. These techniques and algorithms are among the first steps in developing document-type-independent indexing methods for the full text in heterogeneous XML collections.},

abstract = {This research examines the feasibility of dynamic element retrieval in a structured environment. Structured documents and queries are represented in extended vector form, based on a modification of the basic vector space model suggested by Fox [1983]. A method for the dynamic retrieval of XML elements, which requires only a single indexing of the documents at the level of the basic indexing node, is presented. This method, which we refer to as flexible retrieval, produces a rank ordered list of retrieved elements that is equivalent to the result produced by the same retrieval against an all-element index of the collection. Flexible retrieval obviates the need for storing either an all-element index or multiple indices of the collection.},

abstract = {Document-centric XML is a mixture of text and structure. With the increased availability of document-centric XML documents comes a need for query facilities in which both structural constraints and constraints on the content of the documents can be expressed. How does the expressiveness of languages for querying XML documents help users to express their information needs? We address this question from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. Our experimental analysis compares a structure-ignorant with a structure-aware retrieval approach using the test suite of the INEX XML Retrieval Evaluation Initiative. Theoretically, we create two mathematical models of users' knowledge of a set of documents and define query languages which exactly fit these models. One of these languages corresponds to an XML version of fielded search, the other to the INEX query language.Our main experimental findings are: First, while structure is used in varying degrees of complexity, two-thirds of the queries can be expressed in a fielded-search-like format which does not use the hierarchical structure of the documents. Second, three-quarters of the queries use constraints on the context of the elements to be returned; these contextual constraints cannot be captured by ordinary keyword queries. Third, structure is used as a search hint, and not as a strict requirement, when judged against the underlying information need. Fourth, the use of structure in queries functions as a precision enhancing device.},

abstract = {Abbreviations and acronyms are widely used in the biomedical literature and many of them represent important biomedical concepts. Because many abbreviations are ambiguous (e.g., CAT denotes both chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and computed axial tomography, depending on the context), recognizing the full form associated with each abbreviation is in most cases equivalent to identifying the meaning of the abbreviation. This, in turn, allows us to perform more accurate natural language processing, information extraction, and retrieval. In this study, we have developed supervised approaches to identifying the full forms of ambiguous abbreviations within the context they appear. We first automatically assigned multiple possible full forms for each abbreviation; we then treated the in-context full-form prediction for each specific abbreviation occurrence as a case of word-sense disambiguation. We generated automatically a dictionary of all possible full forms for each abbreviation. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms for disambiguation. Because some of the links between abbreviations and their corresponding full forms are explicitly given in the text and can be recovered automatically, we can use these explicit links to automatically provide training data for disambiguating the abbreviations that are not linked to a full form within a text. We evaluated our methods on over 150 thousand abstracts and obtain for coverage and precision results of 82% and 92%, respectively, when performed as tenfold cross-validation, and 79% and 80%, respectively, when evaluated against an external set of abstracts in which the abbreviations are not defined.},

Therefore, a content-based image retrieval system which can automatically assign keywords to images would be very attractive. Unfortunately, it has proved very challenging to build such systems, except where either the image domain is restricted or the keywords relate only to low-level concepts such as color. This article presents a novel image indexing and classification system, called CLAIRE (CLAssifying Images for REtrieval), composed of one image processing module and three modules of support vector machines for color, texture, and high-level concept classification for keyword assignment. The experimental prototype system described here assigns up to five keywords selected from a controlled vocabulary of 60 terms to each image. The system is trained offline by 1639 examples from the Corel stock photo library. For evaluation, five judges reviewed a sample of 800 unknown images to identify which automatically assigned keywords were actually relevant to the image. The system proved to have an 80% probability to assign at least one relevant keyword to an image.},

In this article, we present a new technique called query enrichment, which takes a short query and maps it to intermediate objects. Based on the collected intermediate objects, the query is then mapped to target categories. To build the necessary mapping functions, we use an ensemble of search engines to produce an enrichment of the queries. Our technique was applied to the ACM Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining competition (ACM KDDCUP) in 2005, where we won the championship on all three evaluation metrics (precision, F1 measure, which combines precision and recall, and creativity, which is judged by the organizers) among a total of 33 teams worldwide. In this article, we show that, despite the difficulty of an abundance of ambiguous queries and lack of training data, our query-enrichment technique can solve the problem satisfactorily through a two-phase classification framework. We present a detailed description of our algorithm and experimental evaluation. Our best result for F1 and precision is 42.4% and 44.4%, respectively, which is 9.6% and 24.3% higher than those from the runner-ups, respectively.},

abstract = {In information retrieval, retrieving relevant passages, as opposed to whole documents, not only directly benefits the end user by filtering out the irrelevant information within a long relevant document, but also improves retrieval accuracy in general. A critical problem in passage retrieval is to extract coherent relevant passages accurately from a document, which we refer to as passage extraction. While much work has been done on passage retrieval, the passage extraction problem has not been seriously studied. Most existing work tends to rely on presegmenting documents into fixed-length passages which are unlikely optimal because the length of a relevant passage is presumably highly sensitive to both the query and document.In this article, we present a new method for accurately detecting coherent relevant passages of variable lengths using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM-based method naturally captures the topical boundaries between passages relevant and nonrelevant to the query. Pseudo-feedback mechanisms can be naturally incorporated into such an HMM-based framework to improve parameter estimation. We show that with appropriate parameter estimation, the HMM method outperforms a number of strong baseline methods on two datasets. We further show how the HMM method can be applied on top of any basic passage extraction method to improve passage boundaries.},

abstract = {With continued advances in communication network technology and sensing technology, there is astounding growth in the amount of data produced and made available through cyberspace. Efficient and high-quality clustering of large datasets continues to be one of the most important problems in large-scale data analysis. A commonly used methodology for cluster analysis on large datasets is the three-phase framework of sampling/summarization, iterative cluster analysis, and disk-labeling. There are three known problems with this framework which demand effective solutions. The first problem is how to effectively define and validate irregularly shaped clusters, especially in large datasets. Automated algorithms and statistical methods are typically not effective in handling these particular clusters. The second problem is how to effectively label the entire data on disk (disk-labeling) without introducing additional errors, including the solutions for dealing with outliers, irregular clusters, and cluster boundary extension. The third obstacle is the lack of research about issues related to effectively integrating the three phases. In this article, we describe iVIBRATE---an interactive visualization-based three-phase framework for clustering large datasets. The two main components of iVIBRATE are its VISTA visual cluster-rendering subsystem which invites human interplay into the large-scale iterative clustering process through interactive visualization, and its adaptive ClusterMap labeling subsystem which offers visualization-guided disk-labeling solutions that are effective in dealing with outliers, irregular clusters, and cluster boundary extension. Another important contribution of iVIBRATE development is the identification of the special issues presented in integrating the two components and the sampling approach into a coherent framework, as well as the solutions for improving the reliability of the framework and for minimizing the amount of errors generated within the cluster analysis process. We study the effectiveness of the iVIBRATE framework through a walkthrough example dataset of a million records and we experimentally evaluate the iVIBRATE approach using both real-life and synthetic datasets. Our results show that iVIBRATE can efficiently involve the user in the clustering process and generate high-quality clustering results for large datasets.},

In contrast to previous methods which rely on labeled images provided by the user, this article attempts to enhance the performance of relevance feedback by exploiting unlabeled images existing in the database. Concretely, this article integrates the merits of semisupervised learning and active learning into the relevance feedback process. In detail, in each round of relevance feedback two simple learners are trained from the labeled data, that is, images from user query and user feedback. Each learner then labels some unlabeled images in the database for the other learner. After retraining with the additional labeled data, the learners reclassify the images in the database and then their classifications are merged. Images judged to be positive with high confidence are returned as the retrieval result, while those judged with low confidence are put into the pool which is used in the next round of relevance feedback. Experiments show that using semisupervised learning and active learning simultaneously in CBIR is beneficial, and the proposed method achieves better performance than some existing methods.},

The proposed approach, embedding the decision functions of classifiers and performance metrics into an overall training objective, learns the parameters of classifiers in a decision-feedback manner to effectively take into account both positive and negative training samples, thereby reducing the required size of positive training data. It has three desirable properties: (a) it is a performance metric, oriented learning; (b) the optimized metric is consistent in both training and evaluation sets; and (c) it is more robust and less sensitive to data variation, and can handle insufficient training data scenarios. We evaluate it on a text categorization task using the Reuters-21578 dataset. Training an F1-based binary tree classifier using MFoM, we observed significantly improved performance and enhanced robustness compared to the baseline and SVM, especially for categories with insufficient training samples. The generality for designing other metrics-based classifiers is also demonstrated by comparing precision, recall, and F1-based classifiers. The results clearly show consistency of performance between the training and evaluation stages for each classifier, and MFoM optimizes the chosen metric.},

The system incorporates a number of state-of-the-art research components, some of which are not yet considered mature technology, yet it has been built to be robust enough to be deployed to users who are interested in access to daily news throughout a university campus. In this article we report and discuss a user-evaluation study conducted with 16 users, each of whom utilized the system freely for a one month period. Results from a detailed qualitative analysis are presented, looking at collected questionnaires, incident diaries, and interaction-log data. The findings suggest that our users employed the system in conjunction with their other news update methods, such as watching TV news at home and browsing online news websites at their workplace, their major concerns being up-to-dateness and coverage of the news content. They tried to accommodate the system to fit their established web browsing habits, and they found local news content and the ability to play self-contained news stories on their desktop as major values of the system. Our study also resulted in a detailed wishlist of new features which will help in the further development of both our and others' systems.},

Extracting content that resembles the query alone, however, ignores the greater context of the document. Such context may be central to the purpose and meaning of the document. We developed a generic, a query-based, and a hybrid summarizer, each with differing amounts of document context. The generic summarizer used a blend of discourse information and information obtained through traditional surface-level analysis. The query-based summarizer used only query-term information, and the hybrid summarizer used some discourse information along with query-term information. The validity of the generic summarizer was shown through an intrinsic evaluation using a well-established corpus of human-generated summaries. All three summarizers were then compared in an information-seeking experiment involving 297 subjects. Results from the information-seeking experiment showed that the generic summaries outperformed all others in the browse tasks, while the query-based and hybrid summaries outperformed the generic summary in the search tasks. Thus, the document context of generic summaries helped users browse, while such context was not helpful in search tasks. Such results are interesting given that generic summaries have not been studied in search tasks and the that majority of Internet search engines rely solely on query-based summaries.},

abstract = {There is an increasing demand for similarity searches in a multidimensional non-ordered discrete data space (NDDS) from application areas such as bioinformatics and data mining. The non-ordered and discrete nature of an NDDS raises new challenges for developing efficient indexing methods for similarity searches. In this article, we propose a new indexing technique, called the NSP-tree, to support efficient similarity searches in an NDDS. As we know, overlap causes a performance degradation for indexing methods (e.g., the R-tree) for a continuous data space. In an NDDS, this problem is even worse due to the limited number of elements available on each dimension of an NDDS. The key idea of the NSP-tree is to use a novel discrete space-partitioning (SP) scheme to ensure no overlap at each level in the tree. A number of heuristics and strategies are incorporated into the tree construction algorithms to deal with the challenges for developing an SP-based index tree for an NDDS. Our experiments demonstrate that the NSP-tree is quite promising in supporting efficient similarity searches in NDDSs. We have compared the NSP-tree with the ND-tree, a data-partitioning-based indexing technique for NDDSs that was proposed recently, and the linear scan using different NDDSs. It was found that the search performance of the NSP-tree was better than those of both methods.},

We propose SDC (Static Dynamic Cache), a new caching strategy aimed to efficiently exploit the temporal and spatial locality present in the stream of processed queries. SDC extracts from historical usage data the results of the most frequently submitted queries and stores them in a static, read-only portion of the cache. The remaining entries of the cache are dynamically managed according to a given replacement policy and are used for those queries that cannot be satisfied by the static portion. Moreover, we improve the hit ratio of SDC by using an adaptive prefetching strategy, which anticipates future requests by introducing a limited overhead over the back-end WSE. We experimentally demonstrate the superiority of SDC over purely static and dynamic policies by measuring the hit ratio achieved on three large query logs by varying the cache parameters and the replacement policy used for managing the dynamic part of the cache. Finally, we deploy and measure the throughput achieved by a concurrent version of our caching system. Our tests show how the SDC cache can be efficiently exploited by many threads that concurrently serve the queries of different users.},

abstract = {Digital representations are widely used for audiovisual content, enabling the creation of large online repositories of video, allowing access such as video on demand. However, the ease of copying and distribution of digital video makes piracy a growing concern for content owners. We investigate methods for identifying coderivative video content---that is, video clips that are derived from the same original source. By using dynamic programming to identify regions of similarity in video signatures, it is possible to efficiently and accurately identify coderivatives, even when these regions constitute only a small section of the clip being searched. We propose four new methods for producing compact video signatures, based on the way in which the video changes over time. The intuition is that such properties are likely to be preserved even when the video is badly degraded. We demonstrate that these signatures are insensitive to dramatic changes in video bitrate and resolution, two parameters that are often altered when reencoding. In the presence of mild degradations, our methods can accurately identify copies of clips that are as short as 5 s within a dataset 140 min long. These methods are much faster than previously proposed techniques; using a more compact signature, this query can be completed in a few milliseconds.},

We present a longitudinal study of web site design from 2000 to 2003. We analyze over 150 quantitative measures of interface aspects (e.g., amount of text on pages, numbers and types of links, consistency, accessibility, etc.) for 22,000 pages and over 1,500 sites that received ratings from Internet professionals. We examine characteristics of highly rated sites and provide three perspectives on the evolution of web site design patterns: (1) descriptions of design patterns during each time period; (2) changes in design patterns across the three time periods; and (3) comparisons of design patterns to those that are recommended in the relevant literature (i.e., texts by recognized experts and user studies). We illustrate how design practices conform to or deviate from recommended practices and the consequent implications. We show that the most glaring deficiency of web sites, even for sites that are highly rated, is their inadequate accessibility, in particular for browser scripts, tables, and form elements.},

abstract = {Topical crawling is a young and creative area of research that holds the promise of benefiting from several sophisticated data mining techniques. The use of classification algorithms to guide topical crawlers has been sporadically suggested in the literature. No systematic study, however, has been done on their relative merits. Using the lessons learned from our previous crawler evaluation studies, we experiment with multiple versions of different classification schemes. The crawling process is modeled as a parallel best-first search over a graph defined by the Web. The classifiers provide heuristics to the crawler thus biasing it towards certain portions of the Web graph. Our results show that Naive Bayes is a weak choice for guiding a topical crawler when compared with Support Vector Machine or Neural Network. Further, the weak performance of Naive Bayes can be partly explained by extreme skewness of posterior probabilities generated by it. We also observe that despite similar performances, different topical crawlers cover subspaces on the Web with low overlap.},

abstract = {This work presents a new approach for ranking documents in the vector space model. The novelty lies in two fronts. First, patterns of term co-occurrence are taken into account and are processed efficiently. Second, term weights are generated using a data mining technique called association rules. This leads to a new ranking mechanism called the set-based vector model. The components of our model are no longer index terms but index termsets, where a termset is a set of index terms. Termsets capture the intuition that semantically related terms appear close to each other in a document. They can be efficiently obtained by limiting the computation to small passages of text. Once termsets have been computed, the ranking is calculated as a function of the termset frequency in the document and its scarcity in the document collection. Experimental results show that the set-based vector model improves average precision for all collections and query types evaluated, while keeping computational costs small. For the 2-gigabyte TREC-8 collection, the set-based vector model leads to a gain in average precision figures of 14.7% and 16.4% for disjunctive and conjunctive queries, respectively, with respect to the standard vector space model. These gains increase to 24.9% and 30.0%, respectively, when proximity information is taken into account. Query processing times are larger but, on average, still comparable to those obtained with the standard vector model (increases in processing time varied from 30% to 300%). Our results suggest that the set-based vector model provides a correlation-based ranking formula that is effective with general collections and computationally practical.},

In this article, we address the problem of taxonomy generation for diverse text segments with a general and practical approach that uses the Web as an additional knowledge source. Unlike long documents, short text segments typically do not contain enough information to extract reliable features. This work investigates the possibilities of using highly ranked search-result snippets to enrich the representation of text segments. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is then designed for creating the hierarchical topic structure of text segments. Text segments with close concepts can be grouped together in a cluster, and relevant clusters linked at the same or near levels. Different from traditional clustering algorithms, which tend to produce cluster hierarchies with a very unnatural shape, the algorithm tries to produce a more natural and comprehensive tree hierarchy. Extensive experiments were conducted on different domains of text segments, including subject terms, people names, paper titles, and natural language questions. The obtained experimental results have shown the potential of the proposed approach, which provides a basis for the in-depth analysis of text segments on a larger scale and is believed able to benefit many information systems.},

abstract = {In this article we describe an evaluation of relevance feedback (RF) algorithms using searcher simulations. Since these algorithms select additional terms for query modification based on inferences made from searcher interaction, not on relevance information searchers explicitly provide (as in traditional RF), we refer to them as implicit feedback models. We introduce six different models that base their decisions on the interactions of searchers and use different approaches to rank query modification terms. The aim of this article is to determine which of these models should be used to assist searchers in the systems we develop. To evaluate these models we used searcher simulations that afforded us more control over the experimental conditions than experiments with human subjects and allowed complex interaction to be modeled without the need for costly human experimentation. The simulation-based evaluation methodology measures how well the models learn the distribution of terms across relevant documents (i.e., learn what information is relevant) and how well they improve search effectiveness (i.e., create effective search queries). Our findings show that an implicit feedback model based on Jeffrey's rule of conditioning outperformed other models under investigation.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been widely advocated as a way of coping with the problem of information overload for knowledge workers. Given this, multiple recommendation methods have been developed. However, it has been shown that no one technique is best for all users in all situations. Thus we believe that effective recommender systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and that some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate the various recommendations so that only the best of them (from whatever source) are presented to the user. To this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role. Specifically, this article presents the principled design of such a marketplace (including the auction protocol, the reward mechanism, and the bidding strategies of the individual recommendation agents) and evaluates the market's capability to effectively coordinate multiple methods. Through analysis and simulation, we show that our market is capable of shortlisting recommendations in decreasing order of user perceived quality and of correlating the individual agent's internal quality rating to the user's perceived quality.},

abstract = {Knowledge about the structure and organization of criminal networks is important for both crime investigation and the development of effective strategies to prevent crimes. However, except for network visualization, criminal network analysis remains primarily a manual process. Existing tools do not provide advanced structural analysis techniques that allow extraction of network knowledge from large volumes of criminal-justice data. To help law enforcement and intelligence agencies discover criminal network knowledge efficiently and effectively, in this research we proposed a framework for automated network analysis and visualization. The framework included four stages: network creation, network partition, structural analysis, and network visualization. Based upon it, we have developed a system called CrimeNet Explorer that incorporates several advanced techniques: a concept space approach, hierarchical clustering, social network analysis methods, and multidimensional scaling. Results from controlled experiments involving student subjects demonstrated that our system could achieve higher clustering recall and precision than did untrained subjects when detecting subgroups from criminal networks. Moreover, subjects identified central members and interaction patterns between groups significantly faster with the help of structural analysis functionality than with only visualization functionality. No significant gain in effectiveness was present, however. Our domain experts also reported that they believed CrimeNet Explorer could be very useful in crime investigation.},

Unfortunately, as such networks grow, peers may become overloaded processing messages from other peers. This article examines how to reduce the load on nodes in P2P networks by allowing them to self-organize into a relatively efficient network, and then self-tune to make the network even more efficient. Two local operations used by a peer are introduced: connect(), in which the peer forms an ad hoc search or index link to another peer, and break(), in which the peer breaks a link that is producing too much load. By replacing fixed rules with dynamic local decision-making, such “self-supervising” networks can better adjust to network conditions. Different ways to implement connect() and break() are described, and the network structures that form under different configurations are examined. Simulation results indicate that the ad hoc networks formed using the described techniques are more efficient than popular supernode topologies for several important scenarios. Results for the fault tolerance and search latency of such ad hoc networks are also presented.},

Rather than having to submit explicit user feedback, which can be costly in time and resources and alter the pattern of use within the search experience, some research has explored the collection of implicit measures as an efficient and useful alternative to collecting explicit measure of interest from users.This research article describes a recent study with two main objectives. The first was to test whether there is an association between explicit ratings of user satisfaction and implicit measures of user interest. The second was to understand what implicit measures were most strongly associated with user satisfaction. The domain of interest was Web search. We developed an instrumented browser to collect a variety of measures of user activity and also to ask for explicit judgments of the relevance of individual pages visited and entire search sessions. The data was collected in a workplace setting to improve the generalizability of the results.Results were analyzed using traditional methods (e.g., Bayesian modeling and decision trees) as well as a new usage behavior pattern analysis (“gene analysis”). We found that there was an association between implicit measures of user activity and the user's explicit satisfaction ratings. The best models for individual pages combined clickthrough, time spent on the search result page, and how a user exited a result or ended a search session (exit type/end action). Behavioral patterns (through the gene analysis) can also be used to predict user satisfaction for search sessions.},

We have also used subspace selection using the Wilcoxon rank sum test to exclude tags that have similar expression levels regardless of source. Using these methodologies we have clustered, using the OPTICS algorithm, 88 SAGE libraries derived from cancerous and normal tissues as well as cell line material. Our results produced eight dense clusters representing ovarian cancer cell line, brain cancer cell line, brain cancer bulk tissue, prostate tissue, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer cell line, normal brain, and normal breast bulk tissue. The ovarian cancer and brain cancer cell lines clustered closely together, leading to a further investigation on possible associations between these two cancer types. We also investigated the utility of gene expression data in the classification between normal and cancerous tissues. Our results indicate that brain and breast cancer libraries have strong identities allowing robust discrimination from their normal counterparts. However, the SAGE expression data provide poor predictive accuracy in discriminating between prostate and ovarian cancers and their respective normal tissues.},

The algorithm introduces many refinements to a compression method that combines: (1) encoding by a simple normalized maximum likelihood (NML) model for discrete regression, through reference to preceding approximate matching blocks, (2) encoding by a first order context coding and (3) representing strings in clear, to make efficient use of the redundancy sources in DNA data, under fast execution times. One of the main algorithmic features is the constraint on the matching blocks to include reasonably long contiguous matches, which not only reduces significantly the search time, but also can be used to modify the NML model to exploit the constraint for getting smaller code lengths. The algorithm handles the changing statistics of DNA data in an adaptive way and by predictively encoding the matching pointers it is successful in compressing long approximate matches. Apart from comparison with previous DNA encoding methods, we present compression results for the recently published human genome data.},

abstract = {Interoperability is the most critical issue facing businesses that need to access information from multiple information systems. Our objective in this research is to develop a comprehensive framework and methodology to facilitate semantic interoperability among distributed and heterogeneous information systems. A comprehensive framework for managing various semantic conflicts is proposed. Our proposed framework provides a unified view of the underlying representational and reasoning formalism for the semantic mediation process. This framework is then used as a basis for automating the detection and resolution of semantic conflicts among heterogeneous information sources. We define several types of semantic mediators to achieve semantic interoperability. A domain-independent ontology is used to capture various semantic conflicts. A mediation-based query processing technique is developed to provide uniform and integrated access to the multiple heterogeneous databases. A usable prototype is implemented as a proof-of-concept for this work. Finally, the usefulness of our approach is evaluated using three cases in different application domains. Various heterogeneous datasets are used during the evaluation phase. The results of the evaluation suggest that correct identification and construction of both schema and ontology-schema mapping knowledge play very important roles in achieving interoperability at both the data and schema levels.},

A significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases. In this article we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads. Our previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes, but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files. Alternatively, special-purpose phrase indexes can be used, but it is not feasible to index all phrases. We propose combinations of nextword indexes and phrase indexes with inverted files as a solution to this problem. Our experiments show that combined use of a partial nextword, partial phrase, and conventional inverted index allows evaluation of phrase queries in a quarter the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone; the additional space overhead is only 26% of the size of the inverted file.},

abstract = {A <i>lexical signature</i> (LS) consisting of several key words from a Web document is often sufficient information for finding the document later, even if its URL has changed. We conduct a large-scale empirical study of nine methods for generating lexical signatures, including Phelps and Wilensky's original proposal (PW), seven of our own static variations, and one new dynamic method. We examine their performance on the Web over a 10-month period, and on a TREC data set, evaluating their ability to both (1) uniquely identify the original (possibly modified) document, and (2) locate other relevant documents if the original is lost. Lexical signatures chosen to minimize document frequency (DF) are good at unique identification but poor at finding relevant documents. PW works well on the relatively small TREC data set, but acts almost identically to DF on the Web, which contains billions of documents. Term-frequency-based lexical signatures (TF) are very easy to compute and often perform well, but are highly dependent on the ranking system of the search engine used. The term-frequency inverse-document-frequency- (TFIDF-) based method and hybrid methods (which combine DF with TF or TFIDF) seem to be the most promising candidates among static methods for generating effective lexical signatures. We propose a dynamic LS generator called <i>Test &amp; Select</i> (TS) to mitigate LS conflict. TS outperforms all eight static methods in terms of both extracting the desired document and finding relevant information, over three different search engines. All LS methods show significant performance degradation as documents in the corpus are edited.},

abstract = {Recommender systems using collaborative filtering are a popular technique for reducing information overload and finding products to purchase. One limitation of current recommenders is that they are not portable. They can only run on large computers connected to the Internet. A second limitation is that they require the user to trust the owner of the recommender with personal preference data. Personal recommenders hold the promise of delivering high quality recommendations on palmtop computers, even when disconnected from the Internet. Further, they can protect the user's privacy by storing personal information locally, or by sharing it in encrypted form. In this article we present the new PocketLens collaborative filtering algorithm along with five peer-to-peer architectures for finding neighbors. We evaluate the architectures and algorithms in a series of offline experiments. These experiments show that Pocketlens can run on connected servers, on usually connected workstations, or on occasionally connected portable devices, and produce recommendations that are as good as the best published algorithms to date.},

If a digital object is sealed together with its own audit trail, each user can examine this evidence to decide whether to trust the content---no matter how distant this user is in time, space, and social affiliation from the document's source.We propose an architecture and design that accomplish this: encapsulation of digital object content with metadata describing its origins, cryptographic sealing, webs of trust for public keys rooted in a forest of respected institutions, and a certain way of managing information identifiers. These means will satisfy emerging needs in civilian and military record management, including medical patient records, regulatory records for aircraft and pharmaceuticals, business records for financial audit, legislative and legal briefs, and scholarly works.This is true for any kind of digital object, independent of its purposes and of most data type and representation details, and provides every kind of user---information authors and editors, librarians and collection managers, and information consumers---with autonomy for implied tasks. Our prototype will conform to applicable standards, will be interoperable over most computing bases, and will be compatible with existing digital library software.The proposed architecture integrates software that is mostly available and widely accepted.},

The key new idea of this paper is to model that a relevance judgment is also generated stochastically, and that its data generating function is also governed by those same document and query parameters. The result of this addition is that any available relevance judgments are easily incorporated as additional evidence about the true document and query model parameters. An additional aspect of this approach is that it also resolves the long-standing problem of document-oriented versus query-oriented probabilities. The general approach can be used with a wide variety of hypothesized distributions for documents, queries, and relevance. We test the approach on Reuters Corpus Volume 1, using one set of possible distributions. Experimental results show that the approach does succeed in incorporating relevance data to improve estimates of both document and query parameters, but on this data and for the specific distributions we hypothesized, performance was no better than two separate one-sided models. We conclude that the model's theoretical contribution is its integration of relevance models, document models, and query models, and that the potential for additional performance improvement over one-sided methods requires refinements.},

abstract = {Digital libraries (DLs) are complex information systems and therefore demand formal foundations lest development efforts diverge and interoperability suffers. In this article, we propose the fundamental abstractions of Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies (5S), which allow us to define digital libraries rigorously and usefully. Streams are sequences of arbitrary items used to describe both static and dynamic (e.g., video) content. Structures can be viewed as labeled directed graphs, which impose organization. Spaces are sets with operations on those sets that obey certain constraints. Scenarios consist of sequences of events or actions that modify states of a computation in order to accomplish a functional requirement. Societies are sets of entities and activities and the relationships among them. Together these abstractions provide a formal foundation to define, relate, and unify concepts---among others, of digital objects, metadata, collections, and services---required to formalize and elucidate "digital libraries". The applicability, versatility, and unifying power of the 5S model are demonstrated through its use in three distinct applications: building and interpretation of a DL taxonomy, informal and formal analysis of case studies of digital libraries (NDLTD and OAI), and utilization as a formal basis for a DL description language.},

Although Web anchor texts are wide-scoped hypertext resources, not every particular pair of languages contains sufficient anchor texts for effective extraction of translations for Web queries. For more generalized applications, the approach is designed based on a transitive translation model. The translation equivalents of a query term can be extracted via its translation in an intermediate language. To reduce interference from translation errors, the approach further integrates a competitive linking algorithm into the process of determining the most probable translation. A series of experiments has been conducted, including performance tests on term translation extraction, cross-language information retrieval, and translation suggestions for practical Web search services, respectively. The obtained experimental results have shown that the proposed approach is effective in extracting translations of unknown queries, is easy to combine with the probabilistic retrieval model to improve the cross-language retrieval performance, and is very useful when the considered language pairs lack a sufficient number of anchor texts. Based on the approach, an experimental system called LiveTrans has been developed for English--Chinese cross-language Web search.},

In this article, we propose in addition to the classification capacity of clustering techniques, the possibility of offering a indicative extract about the contents of several sources by means of multidocument summarization techniques. Two kinds of summaries are provided. The first one covers the similarities of each cluster of documents retrieved. The second one shows the particularities of each document with respect to the common topic in the cluster. The document multitopic structure has been used in order to determine similarities and differences of topics in the cluster of documents. The system is independent of document domain and genre.

abstract = {Language modeling approaches to information retrieval are attractive and promising because they connect the problem of retrieval with that of language model estimation, which has been studied extensively in other application areas such as speech recognition. The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and to then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A central issue in language model estimation is smoothing, the problem of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to compensate for data sparseness. In this article, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections. Experimental results show that not only is the retrieval performance generally sensitive to the smoothing parameters, but also the sensitivity pattern is affected by the query type, with performance being more sensitive to smoothing for verbose queries than for keyword queries. Verbose queries also generally require more aggressive smoothing to achieve optimal performance. This suggests that smoothing plays two different role---to make the estimated document language model more accurate and to "explain" the noninformative words in the query. In order to decouple these two distinct roles of smoothing, we propose a two-stage smoothing strategy, which yields better sensitivity patterns and facilitates the setting of smoothing parameters automatically. We further propose methods for estimating the smoothing parameters automatically. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality.},

A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback. Such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore. We experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained Leaky Capacitor algorithm, a branch-and-bound serial symbolic search algorithm, and a Hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm. These algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach, two variations of the user-based approach, and an item-based approach. Our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision, recall, the F-measure, and the rank score. We also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach, that is, incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may "dilute" the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance.},

In this article, we describe a new family of model-based algorithms designed for this task. These algorithms rely on a statistical modelling technique that introduces latent class variables in a mixture model setting to discover user communities and prototypical interest profiles. We investigate several variations to deal with discrete and continuous response variables as well as with different objective functions. The main advantages of this technique over standard memory-based methods are higher accuracy, constant time prediction, and an explicit and compact model representation. The latter can also be used to mine for user communitites. The experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accucracy over existing methods and published results can be obtained.},

A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.},

abstract = {The proliferation of searchable text databases on local area networks and the Internet causes the problem of finding information that may be distributed among many disjoint text databases (distributed information retrieval). How to merge the results returned by selected databases is an important subproblem of the distributed information retrieval task. Previous research assumed that either resource providers cooperate to provide normalizing statistics or search clients download all retrieved documents and compute normalized scores without cooperation from resource providers.This article presents a semisupervised learning solution to the result merging problem. The key contribution is the observation that information used to create resource descriptions for resource selection can also be used to create a centralized sample database to guide the normalization of document scores returned by different databases. At retrieval time, the query is sent to the selected databases, which return database-specific document scores, and to a centralized sample database, which returns database-independent document scores. Documents that have both a database-specific score and a database-independent score serve as training data for learning to normalize the scores of other documents. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that this method is more effective than the well-known CORI result-merging algorithm under a variety of conditions.},

It is often assumed that the use of query operators, such as Boolean operators and phrase searching, improves the effectiveness of Web searching. We test this assumption by examining the effects of query operators on the performance of three major Web search engines. We selected one hundred queries from the transaction log of a Web search service. Each of these original queries contained query operators such as AND, OR, MUST APPEAR (+), or PHRASE (" "). We then removed the operators from these one hundred advanced queries. We submitted both the original and modified queries to three major Web search engines; a total of 600 queries were submitted and 5,748 documents evaluated. We compared the results from the original queries with the operators to the results from the modified queries without the operators. We examined the results for changes in coverage, relative precision, and ranking of relevant documents. The use of most query operators had no significant effect on coverage, relative precision, or ranking, although the effect varied depending on the search engine. We discuss implications for the effectiveness of searching techniques as currently taught, for future information retrieval system design, and for future research.},

abstract = {Specifying exact query concepts has become increasingly challenging to end-users. This is because many query concepts (e.g., those for looking up a multimedia object) can be hard to articulate, and articulation can be subjective. In this study, we propose a query-concept learner that learns query criteria through an intelligent sampling process. Our concept learner aims to fulfill two primary design objectives: (1) it has to be expressive in order to model most practical query concepts and (2) it must learn a concept quickly and with a small number of labeled data since online users tend to be too impatient to provide much feedback. To fulfill the first goal, we model query concepts in k-CNF, which can express almost all practical query concepts. To fulfill the second design goal, we propose our maximizing expected generalization algorithm (MEGA), which converges to target concepts quickly by its two complementary steps: sample selection and concept refinement. We also propose a divide-and-conquer method that divides the concept-learning task into G subtasks to achieve speedup. We notice that a task must be divided carefully, or search accuracy may suffer. Through analysis and mining results, we observe that organizing image features in a multiresolution manner, and minimizing intragroup feature correlation, can speed up query-concept learning substantially while maintaining high search accuracy. Through examples, analysis, experiments, and a prototype implementation, we show that MEGA converges to query concepts significantly faster than traditional methods.},

An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This article introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95% when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.},

We compared the usefulness of these types of evidence on the home page finding task, combined with both content and anchor text baselines. Our experiments made use of five query sets spanning three corpora---one enterprise crawl, and the WT10g and VLC2 Web test collections.We found that, in optimal conditions, all of the query-independent methods studied (in-degree, URL-type, and two variants of PageRank) offered a better than random improvement on a content-only baseline. However, only URL-type offered a better than random improvement on an anchor text baseline. In realistic settings, for either baseline, only URL-type offered consistent gains. In combination with URL-type the anchor text baseline was more useful for finding popular home pages, but URL-type with content was more useful for finding randomly selected home pages. We conclude that a general home page finding system should combine evidence from document content, anchor text, and URL-type classification.},

Positive expansion adds terms to a user's keywords with a Boolean "and," negative expansion adds terms to the user's keywords with a Boolean "not." Each algorithm was examined for three user groups, high, middle, and low achievers, who were classified according to their overall performance. The interactions of users with different levels of expertise with different expansion types or algorithms were evaluated.

Since regions can overlap, a relevant issue is to estimate the proximity of regions in order to predict the number of objects in the regions' intersection. This paper analyzes the problem using a probabilistic approach and provides a solution that effectively computes the proximity through realistic heuristics that only require small amounts of auxiliary data. An extensive simulation to validate the technique is provided. An application is developed to demonstrate how the proximity measure can be successfully applied to the approximate similarity search. Search speedup is achieved by ignoring data regions whose proximity to the query region is smaller than a user-defined threshold. This idea is implemented in a metric tree environment for the similarity range and "nearest neighbors" queries. Several measures of efficiency and effectiveness are applied to evaluate proposed approximate search algorithms on real-life data sets. An analytical model is developed to relate proximity parameters and the quality of search. Improvements of two orders of magnitude are achieved for moderately approximated search results. We demonstrate that the precision of proximity measures can significantly influence the quality of approximated algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to support multilevel access control in video databases. Our access control technique combines a video database indexing mechanism with a hierarchical organization of visual concepts (i.e., video database indexing units), so that different classes of users can access different video elements or even the same video element with different quality levels according to their permissions. These video elements, which, in our access control mechanism, are used for specifying the authorization objects, can be a semantic cluster, a subcluster, a video scene, a video shot, a video frame, or even a salient object (i.e., region of interest). In the paper, we first introduce our techniques for obtaining these multilevel video access units. We also propose a hierarchical video database indexing technique to support our multilevel video access control mechanism. Then, we present an innovative access control model which is able to support flexible multilevel access control to video elements. Moreover, the application of our multilevel video database modeling, representation, and indexing for MPEG-7 is discussed.},

Current research focuses largely on completely autonomous and automatic selection, searching, and results merging in distributed environments. This fully automatic approach has significant deficiencies, including reliance upon thresholds below which databases with relevant documents are not searched (compromised recall). It also merges documents, often from disparate data sources that users may have discarded before their source selection task proceeded (diluted precision). We examine the impact that early user interaction can have on the process of database selection. After analyzing thousands of real user queries, we show that precision can be significantly increased when queries are categorized by the users themselves, then handled effectively by the system. Such query categorization strategies may eliminate limitations of fully automated query processing approaches. Our system harnesses the WIN search engine, a sibling to INQUERY, run against one or more authority sources when search is required. We compare our approach to one that does not recognize or utilize distinct features associated with user queries. We show that by avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach that restricts the role users can play in information discovery, database selection effectiveness can be appreciably improved.},

abstract = {The notion of similarity between objects finds use in many contexts, for example, in search engines, collaborative filtering, and clustering. Objects being compared often are modeled as sets, with their similarity traditionally determined based on set intersection. Intersection-based measures do not accurately capture similarity in certain domains, such as when the data is sparse or when there are known relationships between items within sets. We propose new measures that exploit a hierarchical domain structure in order to produce more intuitive similarity scores. We extend our similarity measures to provide appropriate results in the presence of multisets (also handled unsatisfactorily by traditional measures), for example, to correctly compute the similarity between customers who buy several instances of the same product (say milk), or who buy several products in the same category (say dairy products). We also provide an experimental comparison of our measures against traditional similarity measures, and report on a user study that evaluated how well our measures match human intuition.},

abstract = {Information derived from the cross-references among the documents
in a hyperlinked environment, usually referred to as link
information, is considered important since it can be used to
effectively improve document retrieval. Depending on the retrieval
strategy, link information can be local or global. Local link
information is derived from the set of documents returned as
answers to the current user query. Global link information is
derived from all the documents in the collection. In this work, we
investigate how the use of local link information compares to the
use of global link information. For the comparison, we run a series
of experiments using a large document collection extracted from the
Web. For our reference collection, the results indicate that the
use of local link information improves precision by 74%.
When global link information is used, precision improves by
35%. However, when only the first 10 documents in the
ranking are considered, the average gain in precision obtained with
the use of global link information is higher than the gain obtained
with the use of local link information. This is an interesting
result since it provides insight and justification for the use of
global link information in major Web search engines, where users
are mostly interested in the first 10 answers. Furthermore, global
information can be computed in the background, which allows
speeding up query processing.},

abstract = {The contents of many valuable Web-accessible databases are only available through search interfaces and are hence invisible to traditional Web "crawlers." Recently, commercial Web sites have started to manually organize Web-accessible databases into Yahoo!-like hierarchical classification schemes. Here we introduce QProber, a modular system that automates this classification process by using a small number of query probes, generated by document classifiers. QProber can use a variety of types of classifiers to generate the probes. To classify a database, QProber does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of QProber over collections of real documents, experimenting with different types of document classifiers and retrieval models. We have also tested our system with over one hundred Web-accessible databases. Our experiments show that our system has low overhead and achieves high classification accuracy across a variety of databases.},

abstract = {Modern large retrieval environments tend to overwhelm their users by their large output. Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.},

abstract = {The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is fast emerging as the dominant standard for describing and interchanging data among various systems and databases on the Internet. It offers the Document Type Definition (DTD) as a formalism for defining the syntax and structure of XML documents. The XML Schema definition language, as a replacement for the DTD, provides more rich facilities for defining and constraining the content of XML documents. However, it does not concentrate on the semantics that underlies these documents, representing a logical data model rather than a conceptual model. To enable efficient business application development in large-scale electronic commerce environments, it is necessary to describe and model real-world data semantics and their complex interrelationships. In this article, we describe a design methodology for XML documents. The aim is to enforce XML conceptual modeling power and bridge the gap between software development and XML document structures. The proposed methodology is comprised of two design levels: the semantic level and the schema level. The first level is based on a semantic network, which provides semantic modeling of XML through four major components: a set of atomic and complex nodes, representing real-world objects; a set of directed edges, representing semantic relationships between the objects; a set of labels denoting different types of semantic relationships, including aggregation, generalization, association, and of-property relationships; and finally a set of constraints defined over nodes and edges to constrain semantic relationships and object domains. The other level of the proposed methodology is concerned with detailed XML schema design, including element/attribute declarations and simple/complex type definitions. The mapping between the two design levels is proposed to transform the XML semantic model into the XML Schema, based on which XML documents can be systematically created, managed, and validated.},

Among the random processes we study the binomial distribution and Bose--Einstein statistics. We define two types of term frequency normalization for tuning term weights in the document--query matching process. The first normalization assumes that documents have the same length and measures the information gain with the observed term once it has been accepted as a good descriptor of the observed document. The second normalization is related to the document length and to other statistics. These two normalization methods are applied to the basic models in succession to obtain weighting formulae. Results show that our framework produces different nonparametric models forming baseline alternatives to the standard tf-idf model.},

abstract = {Compression of large collections can lead to improvements in retrieval times by offsetting the CPU decompression costs with the cost of seeking and retrieving data from disk. We propose a semistatic phrase-based approach called xray that builds a model offline using sample training data extracted from a collection, and then compresses the entire collection online in a single pass. The particular benefits of xray are that it can be used in applications where individual records or documents must be decompressed, and that decompression is fast. The xray scheme also allows new data to be added to a collection without modifying the semistatic model. Moreover, xray can be used to compress general-purpose data such as genomic, scientific, image, and geographic collections without prior knowledge of the structure of the data. We show that xray is effective on both text and general-purpose collections. In general, xray is more effective than the popular gzip and compress schemes, while being marginally less effective than bzip2. We also show that xray is efficient: of the popular schemes we tested, it is typically only slower than gzip in decompression. Moreover, the query evaluation costs of retrieval of documents from a large collection with our search engine is improved by more than 30% when xray is incorporated compared to an uncompressed approach. We use simple techniques for obtaining the training data from the collection to be compressed and show that with just over 4% of data the entire collection can be effectively compressed. We also propose four schemes for phrase-match selection during the single pass compression of the collection. We conclude that with these novel approaches xray is a fast and effective scheme for compression and decompression of large general-purpose collections.},

An analytical comparison shows that the retrieval performance of methods based on distinct term-scoring functions is comparable on the whole query set but differs considerably on single queries, consistent with the fact that the ordered sets of expansion terms suggested for each query by the different functions are largely uncorrelated. Motivated by these findings, we argue that the results of multiple functions can be merged, by analogy with ensembling classifiers, and present a simple combination technique based on the rank values of the suggested terms. The combined retrieval feedback method is effective not only with respect to unexpanded queries but also to any individual method, with notable improvements on the system's precision. Furthermore, the combined method is robust with respect to variation of experimental parameters and it is beneficial even when the same information needs are expressed with shorter queries.},

abstract = {The success of text-based retrieval motivates us to investigate analogous techniques which can support the querying and browsing of image data. However, images differ significantly from text both syntactically and semantically in their mode of representing and expressing information. Thus, the generalization of information retrieval from the text domain to the image domain is non-trivial. This paper presents a framework for information retrieval in the image domain which supports content-based querying and browsing of images. A critical first step to establishing such a framework is to construct a codebook of "keywords" for images which is analogous to the dictionary for text documents. We refer to such "keywords" in the image domain as "keyblocks." In this paper, we first present various approaches to generating a codebook containing keyblocks at different resolutions. Then we present a keyblock-based approach to content-based image retrieval. In this approach, each image is encoded as a set of one-dimensional index codes linked to the keyblocks in the codebook, analogous to considering a text document as a linear list of keywords. Generalizing upon text-based information retrieval methods, we then offer various techniques for image-based information retrieval. By comparing the performance of this approach with conventional techniques using color and texture features, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the keyblock-based approach to content-based image retrieval.},

In this paper we describe burst tries and explore the parameters that govern their performance. We experimentally determine good choices of parameters, and compare burst tries to other structures used for the same task, with a variety of data sets. These experiments show that the burst trie is particularly effective for the skewed frequency distributions common in text collections, and dramatically outperforms all other data structures for the task of managing strings while maintaining sort order.},

This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document ("the context"). The context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context. Experimental results testify that using context to guide search, effectively offers even inexperienced users an advanced search tool on the Web.},
