abstract = {We present the experiences from building a web-scale user modeling platform for optimizing display advertising targeting at Yahoo!. The platform described in this paper allows for per-campaign maximization of conversions representing purchase activities or transactions. Conversions directly translate to advertiser's revenue, and thus provide the most relevant metrics of return on advertising investment. We focus on two major challenges: how to efficiently process histories of billions of users on a daily basis, and how to build per-campaign conversion models given the extremely low conversion rates (compared to click rates in a traditional setting). We first present mechanisms for building web-scale user profiles in a daily incremental fashion. Second, we show how to reduce the latency through in-memory processing of billions of user records. Finally, we discuss a technique for scaling the number of handled campaigns/models by introducing an efficient labeling technique that allows for sharing negative training examples across multiple campaigns.},

abstract = {E-commerce has emerged as a popular channel for Web users to conduct transaction over Internet. In e-commerce services, users usually prefer to discover information via querying over category browsing, since the hierarchical structure supported by category browsing can provide them a more effective and efficient way to find their interested properties. However, in many emerging e-commerce services, well-defined hierarchical structures are not always available; moreover, in some other e-commerce services, the pre-defined hierarchical structures are too coarse and less intuitive to distinguish properties according to users interests. This will lead to very bad user experience. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose a hierarchical clustering method to build the query taxonomy based on users' exploration behavior automatically, and further propose an intuitive and light-weight approach to construct browsing list for each cluster to help users discover interested items. The advantage of our approach is four folded. First, we build a hierarchical taxonomy automatically, which saves tedious human effort. Second, we provide a fine-grained structure, which can help user reach their interested items efficiently. Third, our hierarchical structure is derived from users' interaction logs, and thus is intuitive to users. Fourth, given the hierarchical structures, for each cluster, we present both frequently clicked items and retrieved results of queries in the category, which provides more intuitive items to users. We evaluate our work by applying it to the exploration task of a real-world e-commerce service, i.e. online shop for smart mobile phone's apps. Experimental results show that our clustering algorithm is efficient and effective to assist users to discover their interested properties, and further comparisons illustrate that the hierarchical topic browsing performs much better than existing category browsing approach (i.e. Android Market mobile apps category) in terms of information exploration.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present FoCUS (Forum Crawler Under Supervision), a supervised web-scale forum crawler. The goal of FoCUS is to only trawl relevant forum content from the web with minimal overhead. Forum threads contain information content that is the target of forum crawlers. Although forums have different layouts or styles and are powered by different forum software packages, they always have similar implicit navigation paths connected by specific URL types to lead users from entry pages to thread pages. Based on this observation, we reduce the web forum crawling problem to a URL type recognition problem and show how to learn accurate and effective regular expression patterns of implicit navigation paths from an automatically created training set using aggregated results from weak page type classifiers. Robust page type classifiers can be trained from as few as 5 annotated forums and applied to a large set of unseen forums. Our test results show that FoCUS achieved over 98% effectiveness and 97% coverage on a large set of test forums powered by over 150 different forum software packages.},

abstract = {Conventional search engines such as Bing and Google provide a user with a short answer to some queries as well as a ranked list of documents, in order to better meet her information needs. In this paper we study a class of such queries that we call math. Calculations (e.g. "12% of 24$ ", "square root of 120"), unit conversions (e.g. "convert 10 meter to feet"), and symbolic computations (e.g. "plot x^2+x+1") are examples of math queries. Among the queries that should be answered, math queries are special because of the infinite combinations of numbers and symbols, and rather few keywords that form them. Answering math queries must be done through real time computations rather than keyword searches or database look ups. The lack of a formal definition for the entire range of math queries makes it hard to automatically identify them all. We propose a novel approach for recognizing and classifying math queries using large scale search logs, and investigate its accuracy through empirical experiments and statistical analysis. It allows us to discover classes of math queries even if we do not know their structures in advance. It also helps to identify queries that are not math even though they might look like math queries.We also evaluate the usefulness of math answers based on the implicit feedback from users. Traditional approaches for evaluating the quality of search results mostly rely on the click information and interpret a click on a link as a sign of satisfaction. Answers to math queries do not contain links, therefore such metrics are not applicable to them. In this paper we describe two evaluation metrics that can be applied for math queries, and present the results on a large collection of math queries taken from Bing's search logs.},

abstract = {The process of creating modern Web media experiences is challenged by the need to adapt the content and presentation choices to dynamic real-time fluctuations of user interest across multiple audiences. We introduce FAME -- a Framework for Agile Media Experiences -- which addresses this scalability problem. FAME allows media creators to define abstract page models that are subsequently transformed into real experiences through algorithmic experimentation. FAME's page models are hierarchically composed of simple building blocks, mirroring the structure of most Web pages. They are resolved into concrete page instances by pluggable algorithms which optimize the pages for specific business goals. Our framework allows retrieving dynamic content from multiple sources, defining the experimentation's degrees of freedom, and constraining the algorithmic choices. It offers an effective separation of concerns in the media creation process, enabling multiple stakeholders with profoundly different skills to apply their crafts and perform their duties independently, composing and reusing each other's work in modular ways.},

In this paper we describe Delta-Reasoner, a key component of the Intelligent Mobile Platform (IMP), which was designed to support context-aware applications running on mobile devices. Context-aware applications and the mobile platform impose unusual requirements on the reasoner, which we have met by incorporating advanced features such as incremental reasoning and continuous query evaluation into our reasoner. Although we have so far been able to conduct only a very preliminary performance evaluation, our results are very encouraging: our reasoner exhibits sub-second response time on ontologies whose size significantly exceeds the size of the ontologies used in the IMP.},

E-Commerce search engines often have to deal with queries that cannot be easily matched to product inventory resulting in zero recall or null query situations. Null queries arise from differences in buyer and seller vocabulary or from the transient nature of products. In this paper, we describe a system that rewrites null e-commerce queries to find matching products as close to the original query as possible. The system uses query relaxation to rewrite null queries in order to match products. Using eBay as an example of a dynamic marketplace, we show how using temporal feedback that respects product category structure using the repository of expired products, we improve the quality of recommended results. The system is scalable and can be run in a high volume setting. We show through our experiments that high quality product recommendations for more than 25% of null queries are achievable.},

Even web content that is automatically generated from back-end databases is usually presented without the original structural information. In this paper, we present an automated information extraction algorithm that can extract the relevant attribute-value pairs from product descriptions across different sites. A notion, called structural-semantic entropy, is used to locate the data of interest on web pages, which measures the density of occurrence of relevant information on the DOM tree representation of web pages. Our approach is less labor-intensive and insensitive to changes in web-page format. Experimental results on a large number of real-life web page collections are encouraging and confirm the feasibility of the approach, which has been successfully applied to detect false drug advertisements on the web due to its capacity in associating the attributes of records with their respective values.},

Indeed, the criteria taken into account while reviewing a PhD Symposium paper are uncommon ones. Firstly, all the retained papers are introducing innovative scientific ideas. Moreover, they are presenting work in progress, sometimes difficult to be evaluated, and well suited for receiving feedback from experienced researchers as well as from other PhD students working in related research areas.The PhD Symposium is organized into six sessions split between Wednesday 4/18 and Friday 4/20. The first session, on Wednesday afternoon, will have an "annotation" flavor with three works introducing innovative ways of using user generated annotations. The second session, also on Wednesday afternoon, will host papers dealing with Information Retrieval issues in the context of the Web. The third one, on Thursday afternoon, is centered on works related to Social Networks approach applied to the Web. The fourth session, the same afternoon, includes papers aiming at extracting knowledge from the big Web graph. On the last day, the fifth session will be dedicated to works related to the Semantic Web. Finally, the last session, on Friday afternoon, will give us the opportunity of discovering works about innovative Web applications.We hope you enjoy the Symposium!},

State-of-the-art studies in cyberbullying detection have mainly focused on the content of the conversations while largely ignoring the users involved in cyberbullying. We propose that incorporation of the users' information, their characteristics, and post-harassing behaviour, for instance, posting a new status in another social network as a reaction to their bullying experience, will improve the accuracy of cyberbullying detection. Cross-system analyses of the users' behaviour - monitoring their reactions in different online environments - can facilitate this process and provide information that could lead to more accurate detection of cyberbullying.},

Tools used currently by Web archivists blindly crawl and store Web pages found while crawling, disregarding the kind of Web site currently accessed (which leads to suboptimal crawling strategies) and whatever structured content is contained in Web pages (which results in page-level archives whose content is hard to exploit). We focus in this PhD work on the crawling and archiving of publicly accessible Web applications, especially those of the social Web. A Web application is any application that uses Web standards such as HTML and HTTP to publish information on the Web, accessible by Web browsers. Examples include Web forums, social networks, geolocation services, etc. We claim that the best strategy to crawl these applications is to make the Web crawler aware of the kind of application currently processed, allowing it to refine the list of URLs to process, and to annotate the archive with information about the structure of crawled content. We add adaptive characteristics to an archival Web crawler: being able to identify when a Web page belongs to a given Web application and applying the appropriate crawling and content extraction methodology.},

The goal of this PhD research is to investigate the value of the user tags collected with this video labeling game. To this end, we address the following four issues. First, we perform a comparative analysis between user-generated tags and professional annotations in terms of what aspects of videos they describe. Second, we measure how well user tags are suited for fragment retrieval and compare it with fragment search based on other sources like transcripts and professional annotations. Third, as previous research suggested that user tags predominately refer to objects and rarely describe scenes, we will study whether user tags can be successfully exploited to generate scene-level descriptions. Finally, we investigate how tag quality can be characterized and potential methods to improve it.},

In practice, term-wise partitioning shows lacking scalability with increasing collection size and intra-query parallelism, which leads to long query latency and poor performance at low query loads. In our work, we have developed several techniques to deal with these problems. Our current results show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approach on a small distributed IR system, and our next objective is to evaluate the scalability of the improved approach on a large system. In this paper, we describe the relation between our work and the problem of scalability, summarize the results, limitations and challenges of our current work, and outline directions for further research.},

abstract = {Rule based information processing has traditionally been vital in many aspects of business, process manufacturing and information science. The need for rules gets even more magnified when limitations of ontology development in OWL are taken into account. In conjunction, the potent combination of ontology and rule based applications could be the future of information processing and knowledge representation on the web. However, semantic rules tend to be very dependent on multitudes of parameters and context data making it less flexible for use in applications where users could benefit from each other by socially sharing intelligence in the form of policies. This work aims to address this issue arising in rule based semantic applications in the use cases of smart home communities and privacy aware m-commerce setting for mobile users. In this paper, we propose a semantic policy sharing and adaptation infrastructure that enables a semantic rule created in one set of environmental, physical and contextual settings to be adapted for use in a situation when those settings/parameters/context variables change. The focus will mainly be on behavioural policies in the smart home use case and privacy enforcing and data filtering policies in the m-commerce scenario. Finally, we look into the possibility of making this solution application independent so that the benefits of such a policy adaptation infrastructure could be exploited in other application settings as well.},

abstract = {As the volume of information on the Web is explosively growing, recommender systems have become essential tools for helping users to find what they need or prefer. Most existing systems are two-dimensional in that they only exploit User and Item dimensions and perform a typical form of recommendation 'Recommending Item to User'. Yet, in many applications, the capabilities of dealing with multidimensional information and of adapting to various forms of recommendation requests are very important. In this paper, we take a graph-based approach to accomplishing such requirements in recommender systems and present a generic graph-based multidimensional recommendation framework. Based on the framework, we propose two homogeneous graph-based and one heterogeneous graph-based multidimensional recommendation methods. We expect our approach will be useful for increasing recommendation performance and enabling flexibility of recommender systems so that they can incorporate various user intentions into their recommendation process. We present our research result that we have reached and discuss remaining challenges and future work.},

abstract = {Many social media portals are featuring annotation functionality in order to integrate the end users' knowledge with existing digital curation processes. This facilitates extending existing metadata about digital resources. However, due to various levels of annotators' expertise, the quality of annotations can vary from excellent to vague. The evaluation and moderation of annotations (be they troll, vague, or helpful) have not been sufficiently analyzed automatically. Available approaches mostly attempt to solve the problem by using distributed moderation systems, which are influenced by factors affecting accuracy (such as imbalance voting). Despite this, we hypothesize that analyzing and exploiting both content and context dimensions of annotations may assist the automatic moderation process. In this research, we focus on leveraging the context and content features of social web annotations for semi-automatic semantic moderation. This paper describes the vision of our research, proposes an approach for semi-automatic semantic moderation, introduces an ongoing effort from which we collect data that can serve as a basis for evaluating our assumption, and report on lessons learned so far.},

abstract = {Media sharing applications such as Panoramio and Flickr contain a huge amount of pictures that need to be organized to facilitate browsing and retrieval. Such pictures are often surrounded by a set of metadata or image tags, constituting the image context. With the advent of the paradigm of Web 2.0 especially the past five years, the concept of image context has further evolved, allowing users to tag their own and other people's pictures. Focusing on tagging, we distinguish between static and dynamic features. The set of static features include textual and visual features, as well as the contextual information. Further, we may identify other features belonging to the social context as a result of the usage within the media sharing applications. Due to their dynamic nature, we call these the dynamic set of features. In this work, we assume that every media uploaded contains both static and dynamic features. In addition, a user may be linked with other users with whom he/she shares common interests. This has resulted in a new series of challenges within the research field of semantic understanding. One of the main goals of this work is to address these challenges.},

abstract = {Given the ubiquity of data on the web, and the lack of usage restriction enforcement mechanisms, stories of personal, creative and other kinds of data misuses are on the rise. There should be both sociological and technological mechanisms that facilitate accountability on the web that would prevent such data misuses. Sociological mechanisms appeal to the data consumer's self-interest in adhering to the data provider's desires. This involves a system of rewards such as recognition and financial incentives, and deterrents such as prohibitions by laws for any violations and social pressure. Bur there is no well-defined technological mechanism for the discovery of accountability or the lack of it on the web. As part of my PhD thesis I propose a solution to this problem by designing a web protocol called HTTPA (Accountable HTTP). This protocol will enable data consumers and data producers to agree to specific usage restrictions, preserve the provenance of data transferred from a web server to a client and back to another web server, and more importantly provide a mechanism to derive an `audit trail' for the data reuse with the help of a trusted intermediary called a `Provenance Tracker Network'.},

Unfortunately, the current systems extracting knowledge from result pages lack accuracy.In this proposal, we present AMBER, a system fully automated turning annotations to structured knowledge from any result page of a given domain. AMBER observes basic domain attributes on a page and leverages repeated occurrences of similar attributes to group related attributes into records. This contrasts to previous approaches that analyze the repeated structure only of the HTML, as no domain knowledge is available. Our multi-domain experimental evaluation on hundreds of sites demonstrates that AMBER achieves accuracy (&gt;98%) comparable to skilled human annotator.},

We first use a machine learning method to identify the key events from Chinese news stories. Then we extract event 5W1H elements by employing the combination of SRL, NER technique and rule-based method. At last we populate the extracted facts of news events to NOEM, an event ontology designed specifically for modeling semantic elements and relations of events.

This work proposes a semi-structured semantic overlay for information retrieval in large-scale self-organizing networks. With the autonomy to their own resources, the nodes are organized into a semantic overlay hosting topically discriminative communities. For information retrieval within a community, unstructured routing approach is employed for the sake of flexibility; While for joining new nodes and routing queries to a distant community, a structured mechanism is designed to save the traffic and time cost. Different from the semantic overlay in the literature, our proposal has three contributions: 1. we design topic-based indexing to form and maintain the semantic overlay, to guarantee both scalability and efficiency; 2. We introduce unstructured routing approach within the community, to allow flexible node joining and leaving; 3. We take advantage of the interaction among nodes to capture the overlay changes and make corresponding adaption in topic-based indexing.},

The prototype aims to provide a multilingual natural language interface for querying the content of patent documents. The developed system is focused on the biomedical and pharmaceutical domain and includes the translation of the patent claims and abstracts into English, French and German. Aiming at the best retrieval results of the patent information and text content, patent documents are preprocessed and semantically annotated. Then, the annotations are stored and indexed in an OWLIM semantic repository, which contains a patent specific ontology and others from different domains. The prototype, accessible online at http://molto-patents.ontotext.com, presents a multilingual natural language interface to query the retrieval system. In MOLTO, the multilingualism of the queries is addressed by means of the GF Tool, which provides an easy way to build and maintain controlled language grammars for interlingual translation in limited domains. The abstract representation obtained from the GF is used to retrieve both the matched RDF instances and the list of patents semantically related to the user's search criteria. The online interface allows to browse the retrieved patents and shows on the text the semantic annotations that explain the reason why any particular patent has matched the user's criteria.},

abstract = {With the success of Web 2.0 we are witnessing a growing number of services and APIs exposed by Telecom, IT and content providers. Targeting the Web community and, in particular, Web application developers, service providers expose capabilities of their infrastructures and applications in order to open new markets and to reach new customer groups. However, due to the complexity of the underlying technologies, the last step, i.e., the consumption and integration of the offered services, is a non-trivial and time-consuming task that is still a prerogative of expert developers. Although many approaches to lower the entry barriers for end users exist, little success has been achieved so far. In this paper, we introduce the OMELETTE project and show how it addresses end-user-oriented telco mashup development. We present the goals of the project, describe its contributions, summarize current results, and describe current and future work.},

The objective of the work is to build an ontology-based multilingual application for museum information on the Web. Our approach relies on the innovative idea of Reason-able View of the Web of linked data applied to the domain of cultural heritage. We have been developing a Web application that uses Semantic Web ontologies for generating coherent multilingual natural language descriptions about museum objects. We have been experimenting with museum data to test our approach and find that it performs well for the examined languages.},

Experiences show that they fail when confronted with agents that are new emerging like the agents causing the lung disease SARS in 2002. Further, due to slow reporting mechanisms, the time until health threats become visible to public health officials can be long. The M-Eco project provides an event-based approach to the early detection of emerging health threats. The developed technologies exploit content from social media and multimedia data as input and analyze it by sophisticated event-detection techniques to identify potential threats. Alerts for public health threats are provided to the user in a personalized way.},

abstract = {SocialSensor will develop a new framework for enabling real-time multimedia indexing and search in the Social Web. The project moves beyond conventional text-based indexing and retrieval models by mining and aggregating user inputs and content over multiple social networking sites. Social Indexing will incorporate information about the structure and activity of the users social network directly into the multimedia analysis and search process. Furthermore, it will enhance the multimedia consumption experience by developing novel user-centric media visualization and browsing paradigms. For example, SocialSensor will analyse the dynamic and massive user contributions in order to extract unbiased trending topics and events and will use social connections for improved recommendations. To achieve its objectives, SocialSensor introduces the concept of Dynamic Social COntainers (DySCOs), a new layer of online multimedia content organisation with particular emphasis on the real-time, social and contextual nature of content and information consumption. Through the proposed DySCOs-centered media search, SocialSensor will integrate social content mining, search and intelligent presentation in a personalized, context and network-aware way, based on aggregation and indexing of both UGC and multimedia Web content.},

abstract = {Search engines are the sinews of the web. These sinews have become strained, however: Where the web's function once was a mix of library and yellow pages, it has become the central marketplace for information of almost any kind. We search more and more for objects with specific characteristics, a car with a certain mileage, an affordable apartment close to a good school, or the latest accessory for our phones. Search engines all too often fail to provide reasonable answers, making us sift through dozens of websites with thousands of offers--never to be sure a better offer isn't just around the corner. What search engines are missing is understanding of the objects and their attributes published on websites.Automatically identifying and extracting these objects is akin to alchemy: transforming unstructured web information into highly structured data with near perfect accuracy. With DIADEM we present a formula for this transformation, but at a price: DIADEM identifies and extracts data from a website with high accuracy. The price is that for this task we need to provide DIADEM with extensive knowledge about the ontology and phenomenology of the domain, i.e., about entities (and relations) and about the representation of these entities in the textual, structural, and visual language of a website of this domain. In this demonstration, we demonstrate with a first prototype of DIADEM that, in contrast to alchemists, DIADEM has developed a viable formula.},

Harnessing the huge potential of the web together with open statistical machine translation (SMT) technologies LetsMT! has created an innovative online collaborative platform for data sharing and building MT. Users can upload their parallel corpora to an online repository and generate user-tailored SMT systems based on user selected data. FP7 Programme project ACCURAT researches new methods for accumulating more data from the Web to improve the quality of data-driven machine translation systems. ACCURAT has created techniques and tools to use comparable corpora such as news feeds and multinational web pages. Although the majority of these texts are not direct translations, they share a lot of common paragraphs, sentences, phrases, terms and named entities in different languages which are useful for machine translation.},

The growth and success of the Semantic Web is built upon a wide range of Semantic technologies from ontology engineering tools through to semantic web service discovery and semantic search. The evaluation of such technologies - and, indeed, assessments of their mutual compatibility - is critical for their sustained improvement and adoption. The SEALS project is creating an open and sustainable platform on which all aspects of an evaluation can be hosted and executed and has been designed to accommodate most technology types. It is envisaged that the platform will become the de facto repository of test datasets and will allow anyone to organise, execute and store the results of technology evaluations free of charge and without corporate bias. The demonstration will show how individual tools can be prepared for evaluation, uploaded to the platform, evaluated according to some criteria and the subsequent results viewed. In addition, the demonstration will show the flexibility and power of the SEALS Platform for evaluation organisers by highlighting some of the key technologies used.},

In our CFP we encouraged submitters to search for "the WOW! effect" -- something in their demonstration that would cause attendees to think to themselves and say to others, "this is really amazing! This is what the Web is for!" The submitters met our challenge and provided a collection of demonstrations that have something for everyone. Our Program Committee had the difficult task of choosing the few that we were able to fit into the program. Out of 79 submissions, we were able to accept 14 full demonstrations and 22 short demonstrations.The demonstrations have been organized into five logical sub-tracks: Web Culture and MediaSocial Networks and Personalized Access to InformationNew Paradigms for Searching and FindingHelping Developers to Tame the WebGovernment and the People on the WebWe are also fortunate to have 3 exceptional invited demonstrations. Piotr Adamczyk of the Google Art Project Team will demonstrate how Google has collaborated with some of the great art museums of the world to provide access to hundreds of artworks at incredible zoom levels. Such detail to art masterpieces has never before been possible except to museum curators. Curtis Wong, manager of Next Media Research for Microsoft, will reprise his immensely popular TED talk on the WorldWide Telescope. This powerful Webbased tool for exploring the universe compiles images from telescopes and satellites to build a comprehensive, interactive view of the cosmos. Our third invited demonstration is from the office of the Conseil G\'{e}n\'{e}ral de Sa\^{o}ne-et-Loire in France. The objectives of their Opendata71.fr project is to transform the relationship between citizens and local government by increasing the understanding of the missions, actions, and roles both of the administration and the elected representatives.We would like to invite WWW2012 registrants to attend as many sessions in the Demo Track as your schedule allows. Many of the demo presenters have also consented to repeat their presentations and host faceto- face discussions in an area specifically designated in the exhibition hall. In a joint experiment with the IW3C2, some of the demonstrations will even be available in the virtual world Second Life.},

abstract = {A novel method is demonstrated that allows semantic and well-structured knowledge bases (such as DBpedia) to be easily queried directly from Wikipedia's pages. Using Swipe, naive users with no knowledge of RDF triples and SPARQL can easily query DBpedia with powerful questions such as: "Who are the U.S. presidents who took office when they were 55-year old or younger, during the last 60 years", or "Find the town in California with less than 10 thousand people". This is accomplished by a novel Search by Example (SBE) approach where a user can enter the query conditions directly on the Infobox of a Wikipedia page. In fact, Swipe activates various fields of Wikipedia to allow users to enter query conditions, and then uses these conditions to generate equivalent SPARQL queries and execute them on DBpedia. Finally, Swipe returns the query results in a form that is conducive to query refinements and further explorations. Swipe's SBE approach makes semi-structured documents queryable in an intuitive and user-friendly way and, through Wikipedia, delivers the benefits of querying and exploring large knowledge bases to all Web users.},

Both integrity constraints and "access restrictions" can be of great use to web exploration tools. We demonstrate here a novel technique for discovering constraints that requires no form submissions whatsoever. We work via statically analyzing the JavaScript client-side code used to enforce the constraints, when such code is available. We combine custom recognizers for JavaScript functions relevant to constraint checking with a generic program analysis layer. Integrated with a web browser, our system shows the constraints detected on accessed web forms, and allows a user to see the corresponding JavaScript code fragment.},

abstract = {The last years there is an increasing interest on providing the top search results while the user types a query letter by letter. In this paper we present and demonstrate a family of instant search applications which apart from showing instantly only the top search results, they can show various other kinds of precomputed aggregated information. This paradigm is more helpful for the end user (in comparison to the classic search-as-you-type), since it can combine autocompletion, search-as-you-type, results clustering, faceted search, entity mining, etc. Furthermore, apart from being helpful for the end user, it is also beneficial for the server's side. However, the instant provision of such services for large number of queries, big amounts of precomputed information, and large number of concurrent users is challenging. We demonstrate how this can be achieved using very modest hardware. Our approach relies on (a) a partitioned trie-based index that exploits the available main memory and disk, and (b) dedicated caching techniques. We report performance results over a server running on a modest personal computer (with 3 GB main memory) that provides instant services for millions of distinct queries and terabytes of precomputed information. Furthermore these services are tolerant to user typos and the word order.},

abstract = {Many smartphones, nowadays, use GPS to detect the location of the user, and can use the Internet to interact with remote location-based services. These two capabilities support online navigation that incorporates search. In this demo we presents WISER---a system for Web-based Interactive Search en Route. In the system, users perform route search by providing (1) a target location, and (2) search terms that specify types of geographic entities to be visited.The task is to find a route that minimizes the travel distance from the initial location of the user to the target, via entities of the specified types. However, planning a route under conditions of uncertainty requires the system to take into account the possibility that some visited entities will not satisfy the search requirements, so that the route may need to go via several entities of the same type. In an interactive search, the user provides feedback regarding her satisfaction with entities she visits during the travel, and the system changes the route, in real time, accordingly. The goal is to use the interaction for computing a route that is more effective than a route that is computed in a non-interactive fashion.},

abstract = {Wrapper induction faces a dilemma: To reach web scale, it requires automatically generated examples, but to produce accurate results, these examples must have the quality of human annotations. We resolve this conflict with AMBER, a system for fully automated data extraction from result pages. In contrast to previous approaches, AMBER employs domain specific gazetteers to discern basic domain attributes on a page, and leverages repeated occurrences of similar attributes to group related attributes into records rather than relying on the noisy structure of the DOM. With this approach AMBER is able to identify records and their attributes with almost perfect accuracy (&gt;98%) on a large sample of websites. To make such an approach feasible at scale, AMBER automatically learns domain gazetteers from a small seed set. In this demonstration, we show how AMBER uses the repeated structure of records on deep web result pages to learn such gazetteers. This is only possible with a highly accurate extraction system. Depending on its parametrization, this learning process runs either fully automatically or with human interaction. We show how AMBER bootstraps a gazetteer for UK locations in 4 iterations: From a small seed sample we achieve 94.4% accuracy in recognizing UK locations in the $4th$ iteration.},

OPAL interprets this labeling and classifies the fields according to a given domain ontology. The combination of these two properties, allows OPAL to deal effectively with many forms outside of the grasp of existing form filling techniques.

ResEval Mash is a hosted mashup platform with a client-side editor and runtime engine, both running inside a common web browser. It supports the processing of also large amounts of data, a feature that is achieved via the sensible distribution of the respective computation steps over client and server. Our preliminary user study shows that ResEval Mash indeed has the power to enable domain experts to develop own mashups (research evaluation metrics); other mashup platforms rather support skilled developers.

To ease wrapper refinement, it offers a list of wrappers ranked by example similarity and robustness. Visual OXPath offers extensive visual feedback for this refinement which can be performed without any knowledge of the underlying wrapper language. Where further refinement by a human wrapper is needed, Visual OXPath profits from being based on OXPath, a declarative wrapper language that extends XPath with a thin layer of features necessary for extraction and page navigation.},

Although the set of (open) data sources is rapidly growing, the integration of multimedia in this Web of Data is still at a very early stage. This paper describes, how arbitrary video content and metadata can be processed to identify meaningful linking partners for video fragments - and thus create a web of linked media. The video test-set for our demonstrator is part of the Red Bull Content Pool and confined to the Cliff Diving domain. The candidate set of possible link targets is a combination of a Red Bull thesaurus, information about divers from www.redbull.com and concepts from DBPedia. The demo includes both a semantic search on videos and video fragments and a player for videos with semantic enhancements.},

abstract = {Processing web interaction data is known to be cumbersome and time-consuming. State-of-the-art web tracking systems usually allow replaying user interactions in the form of mouse tracks, a video-like visualization scheme, to engage practitioners in the analysis process. However, traditional online video inspection has not explored the full capabilities of hypermedia and interactive techniques. In this paper, we introduce a web-based tracking tool that generates interactive visualizations from users' activity. The system unobtrusively collects browser events derived from normal usage, offering a unified framework to inspect interaction data in several ways. We compare our approach to related work in the research community as well as in commercial systems, and describe how ours fits in a real-world scenario. This research shows that there is a wide range of applications where the proposed tool can assist the WWW community.},

abstract = {Online social networks like Facebook allow users to connect, communicate, and share content. The popularity of these services has lead to an information overload for their users; the task of simply keeping track of different interactions has become daunting. To reduce this burden, sites like Facebook allows the user to group friends into specific lists, known as friendlists, aggregating the interactions and content from all friends in each friendlist. While this approach greatly reduces the burden on the user, it still forces the user to create and populate the friendlists themselves and, worse, makes the user responsible for maintaining the membership of their friendlists over time. We show that friendlists often have a strong correspondence to the structure of the social network, implying that friendlists may be automatically inferred by leveraging the social network structure. We present a demonstration of Friendlist Manager, a Facebook application that proposes friendlists to the user based on the structure of their local social network, allows the user to tweak the proposed friendlists, and then automatically creates the friendlists for the user.},

Our system features two unique characteristics that enable efficient processing of both simple and multi-join SPARQL queries on virtually unlimited number of triples: Join algorithms that execute joins according to query selectivity to reduce processing; and adaptive choice among centralized and distributed (MapReduce-based) join execution for fast query responses. Our system efficiently answers both simple joins and complex multivariate queries and easily scales to 3 billion triples using a small cluster of 9 worker nodes. H2RDF outperforms state-of-the-art distributed solutions in multi-join and nonselective queries while achieving comparable performance to centralized solutions in selective queries. In this demonstration we showcase the system's functionality through an interactive GUI. Users will be able to execute predefined or custom-made SPARQL queries on datasets of different sizes, using different join algorithms. Moreover, they can repeat all queries utilizing a different number of cluster resources. Using real-time cluster monitoring and detailed statistics, participants will be able to understand the advantages of different execution schemes versus the input data as well as the scalability properties of H2RDF over both the data size and the available worker resources.},

Baya mines candidate patterns from pipe models available online and thereby leverages on the knowledge of the crowd, i.e., of other developers. Baya is an extension for the Firefox browser that seamlessly integrates with Pipes. It enhances Pipes with a powerful new feature for both expert developers and beginners, speeding up the former and enabling the latter.

We have applied S2S in three different scenarios: (1) the development of a faceted browse interface integrated with an interactive mapping and visualization tool for biological and chemical oceanographic data, (2) the development of a faceted browser for more than 700,000 open government datasets in over 100 catalogs worldwide, and (3) the development of a user interface for a virtual observatory in the field of solar-terrestrial physics. Throughout this paper, we discuss the architecture of the S2S framework, focusing on its extensibility and reusability, and also review the application scenarios.},

The initial Web 2.0 Social Network application was written by a group of students over a period of 4 months in the spring of 2011. It had all the bells and whistles of the well known Social Networks: walls to post on, circles of friends, etc. The students were very enthusiastic in building their social network, but the chances of it growing into a large community were close to non-existent unless a way could be found to tie it into a bigger social network. This is where linked data protected by the Web Access Control Ontology and WebID authentication could come to the rescue. The paper describes this transformation process, and we will demonstrate the full software version at the conference.},

We demonstrate Casis, a system for concept-aware social image search. Casis detects tag concepts based on the collective knowledge embedded in social tagging from the initial results to a query. A tag concept is a set of tags highly associated with each other and collectively conveys a semantic meaning. Images to a query are then organized by tag concepts. Casis provides intuitive and interactive browsing of search results through a tag concept graph, which visualizes the tags defining each tag concept and their relationships within and across concepts. Supporting multiple retrieval methods and multiple concept detection algorithms, Casis offers superior social image search experiences by choosing the most suitable retrieval methods and concept-aware image organizations.},

abstract = {Models of sentiment analysis in text require an understanding of what kinds of sentiment-bearing language are generally used to describe specific topics. Thus, fine-grained sentiment analysis requires both a topic lexicon and a sentiment lexicon, and an affective mapping between both. For instance, when one speaks disparagingly about a city (like London, say), what aspects of city does one generally focus on, and what words are used to disparage those aspects? As when we talk about the weather, our language obeys certain familiar patterns - what we might call clich\'{e}s and stereotypes - when we talk about familiar topics. In this paper we describe the construction of an affective stereotype lexicon, that is, a lexicon of stereotypes and their most salient affective qualities. We show, via a demonstration system called MOODfinger, how this lexicon can be used to underpin the processes of affective query expansion and summarization in a system for retrieving and organizing news content from the Web. Though we adopt a simple bipolar +/- view of sentiment, we show how this stereotype lexicon allows users to coin their own nuanced moods on demand.},

Notifying patients and physicians of potential drug effects is an important step in improving healthcare quality and delivery. With the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 applications, more and more patients start discussing drug side effects in many online sources. In this paper, we describe our efforts on building UDWarning, a novel early warning system for unrecognized drug side effects discovery based on the text information gathered from the Internet. The system can automatically build a knowledge base for drug side effects by integrating the information related to drug side effects from different sources. It can also monitor the online information about drugs and discover possible unrecognized drug side effects. Our demonstration will show that the system has the potentials to expedite the discovery process of unrecognized drug side effects and to improve the quality of healthcare.},

In Titan, two main technologies, i.e., web service clustering and tag recommendation, are employed to improve the effectiveness of web service discovery. Specifically, both WSDL (Web Service Description Language) documents and tags of web services are utilized for clustering, while tag recommendation is adopted to handle some inherent problems of tagging data, e.g., uneven tag distribution and noise tags.},

Given a natural language question, DEANNA translates questions into a structured SPARQL query that can be evaluated over knowledge bases such as Yago, Dbpedia, Freebase, or other Linked Data sources. DEANNA analyzes questions and maps verbal phrases to relations and noun phrases to either individual entities or semantic classes. Importantly, it judiciously generates variables for target entities or classes to express joins between multiple triple patterns. We leverage the semantic type system for entities and use constraints in jointly mapping the constituents of the question to relations, classes, and entities. We demonstrate the capabilities and interface of DEANNA, which allows advanced users to influence the translation process and to see how the different components interact to produce the final result.},

abstract = {We are very pleased to welcome the 100 posters of this WWW 2012 poster track. We wish to thank all Program Committee members for the quality (and the quantity) of their work. And naturally, we also congratulate authors of the selected contributions that reflect the variety of the WWW series conferences: all posters present high quality work in various domains, poster authors come from various countries and represent both academic and industrial research teams. The poster track provides an opportunity for authors and conference attendees to interact and exchange about innovative theoretical and technical work in progress around, about and on the Web.In addition to being displayed during three whole days from 4/18 to 4/20, WWW'2012 posters will also be shortly presented on Thursday 4/19 PM. Seven "spotlight events" are organized to give conference attendees a 5-minute glimpse on each poster content, in the following areas:1 - Web search / Web mining: WWW contains rich data, yet how to effectively use such rich data is challenging. Web search is mainly about searching information with a proper query, while web mining has a boarder scope of knowledge exaction from the Web.2 - Natural Language Processing / Information Search and Retrieval: NLP and IR are two major foundations of Web search. With more and more applications on the Web, the boundary between NLP and IR is getting smaller. How to efficiently and effectively handle large scale online data is a challenge for NLP and IR communities.3 - Web engineering / Performance / Security / Privacy: this session copes with the everyday challenges of Web development: how to improve contents and applications design processes, how to serve them efficiently and securely to users and how to face privacy issues.4 - Recommender Systems / Semantic Web: Recommender Systems allow Web communities access the best of users' opinions. Semantic Web and Linked Data rely on communities' data to harvest and process complex information. This session presents posters that cope with graph algorithms and semantic/social data.5 - Social Web / Human Factors / Accessibility: this session deals with human-oriented topics. The presented posters mainly concern analysis and prediction of social behavior and influence, as well as of individual behavior, affective computing and Web accessibility.6 - Microblogging / Social media / Catch up TV: social media and microblogging provide rich online information with a different perspective from traditional static Web page data. How to effectively search, mine and utilize such valuable information is a very stimulating research area.7 - Monetization: posters in this session explore efficient ways to spread ads on the Web or analyze the efficiency of existing algorithms on actual e-commerce activity.This year's edition aims at "augmenting posters" in several ways: poster views are also available in virtual worlds, and attendees can access poster metadata and additional information and even chat with authors using their smartphones and tabs. Numerous efforts have been made to encourage discussions about posters for the largest audience, inside and outside the conference. So come, see and participate!},

abstract = {We describe a framework for a micro-blogging social network implemented in an unstructured peer-to-peer network. A micro-blogging social network must provide capabilities for users to (i) publish, (ii) follow and (iii) search. Our retrieval mechanism is based on a probably approximately correct (PAC) search architecture in which a query is sent to a fixed number of nodes in the network. In PAC, the probability of attaining a particular accuracy is a function of the number of nodes queried (fixed) and the replication rate of documents (micro-blog). Publishing a micro-blog then becomes a matter of replicating the micro-blog to the required number of random nodes without any central coordination. To solve this, we use techniques from the field of rumour spreading (gossip protocols) to propagate new documents. Our document spreading algorithm is designed such that a document has a very high probability of being copied to only the required number of nodes. Results from simulations performed on networks of 10,000, 100,000 and 500,000 nodes verify our mathematical models. The framework is also applicable for indexing dynamic web pages in a distributed search engine or for a system which indexes newly created BitTorrents in a decentralized environment.},

abstract = {Display advertising has been a significant source of revenue for publishers and ad networks in the online advertising ecosystem. One of the main goals in display advertising is to maximize user response rate for advertising campaigns, such as click through rates (CTR) or conversion rates. Although %in the online advertising industry we believe that the visual appearance of ads (creatives) matters for propensity of user response, there is no published work so far to address this topic via a systematic data-driven approach. In this paper we quantitatively study the relationship between the visual appearance and performance of creatives using large scale data in the world's largest display ads exchange system, RightMedia. We designed a set of 43 visual features, some of which are novel and some are inspired by related work. We extracted these features from real creatives served on RightMedia. Then, we present recommendations of visual features that have the most important impact on CTR to the professional designers in order to optimize their creative design. We believe that the findings presented in this paper will be very useful for the online advertising industry in designing high-performance creatives. We have also designed and conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of visual features by themselves for CTR prediction.},

We provide three main results: 1) online consumption is more concentrated than off-line audience, contradicting the hypothesis of a long tail effect of catch up TV; 2) the temporality of replay TV consumption on the web is very close to the live broadcasting of the programs, thus softening rather than breaking the synchrony of traditional TV; 3) detailed data on online consumption of news reveals two patterns of consumption ("alternative TV ritual" vs. "\`{a} la carte").},

abstract = {The Social Semantic Web (SSW) refers to the mix of RDF data in web content, and social network data associated with those who posted that content. Applications to monitor the SSW are becoming increasingly popular. For instance, marketers want to look for semantic patterns relating to the content of tweets and Facebook posts relating to their products. Such applications allow multiple users to specify patterns of interest, and monitor them in real-time as new data gets added to the web or to a social network. In this paper, we develop the concept of SSW view servers in which all of these types of applications can be simultaneously monitored from such servers. The patterns of interest are views. We show that a given set of views can be compiled in multiple possible ways to take advantage of common substructures, and define the concept of an optimal merge. We develop a very fast MultiView algorithm that scalably and efficiently maintains multiple subgraph views. We show that our algorithm is correct, study its complexity, and experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm can scalably handle updates to hundreds of views on real-world SSW databases with up to 540M edges.},

The ad impression opportunity would materialize into revenue only if the ad network wins the impression and a user clicks on the ads, both as a rare event especially in an open exchange for contextual ads. Given a low revenue expectation and the elusive nature of predicting weak-signal click-through rates, the computational cost incurred by bid estimation shall be cautiously justified. We developed and deployed a novel impression valuation model, which is expected to reduce the computational cost by 95% and hence more than double the profit. Our approach is highly economized through a fast implementation of kNN regression that primarily leverages low-dimensional sell-side data (user and publisher). We also address the cold-start problem or the exploration vs. exploitation requirement by Bayesian smoothing using a beta prior, and adapt to the temporal dynamics using an autoregressive model.},

However several studies suggested that there are so called good abandonments, i.e. situations when search engine result page (SERP) contains enough details to satisfy the user information need without necessity to click on search results. In those papers only editorial metrics of SERP were used, and one cannot be sure that situations marked as good abandonments by assessors actually imply user satisfaction. In present work we propose some real-world evidences for good abandonments by calculating correlation between editorial and click metrics.},

We show, that we can train a classifier which is able to distinguish between potential good and bad abandonments with rather good results compared to our baseline. As a case study we show how to apply these ideas to IR evaluation and introduce a new metric for A/B-testing -- Bad Abandonment Rate.},

Starting with a set of important metrics, we identify query segments that are "interesting" with respect to these metrics using a distributed frequent itemset mining algorithm.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end user development, i.e., on enabling end users without programming skills to compose own applications. Yet, similar to what happened with analogous promises in web service composition and business process management, research has mostly focused on technology and, as a consequence, has failed its objective. Plain technology (e.g., SOAP/WSDL web services) or simple modeling languages (e.g., Yahoo! Pipes) don't convey enough meaning to non-programmers. We propose a domain-specific approach to mashups that "speaks the language of the user", i.e., that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with. We show what developing a domain-specific mashup tool means, which role the mashup meta-model and the domain model play and how these can be merged into a domain-specific mashup meta-model. We apply the approach implementing a mashup tool for the research evaluation domain. Our user study confirms that domain-specific mashup tools indeed lower the entry barrier to mashup development.},

Pipes or JackBe Presto Wires, developing mashups is still non-trivial and requires intimate knowledge about the functionality of web APIs and services, their interfaces, parameter settings, data mappings, and so on. We aim to assist the mashup process and to turn it into an interactive co-creation process, in which one part of the solution comes from the developer and the other part from reusable composition knowledge that has proven successful in the past. We harvest composition knowledge from a repository of existing mashup models by mining a set of reusable composition patterns, which we then use to interactively provide composition recommendations to developers while they model their own mashup. Upon acceptance of a recommendation, the purposeful design of the respective pattern types allows us to automatically weave the chosen pattern into a partial mashup model, in practice performing a set of modeling actions on behalf of the developer. The experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation demonstrates that it is indeed possible to harvest meaningful, reusable knowledge from existing mashups, and that even complex recommendations can be efficiently queried and weaved also inside the client browser.},

abstract = {In the presence of sudden outbreaks, how can social media streams be used to strengthen surveillance capabilities? In May 2011, Germany reported one of the largest described outbreaks of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). By end of June, 47 persons had died. After the detection of the outbreak, authorities investigating the cause and the impact in the population were interested in the analysis of micro-blog data related to the event. Since Thousands of tweets related to this outbreak were produced every day, this task was overwhelming for experts participating in the investigation. In this work, we propose a Personalized Tweet Ranking algorithm for Epidemic Intelligence (PTR4EI), that provides users a personalized, short list of tweets based on the user's context. PTR4EI is based on a learning to rank framework and exploits as features, complementary context information extracted from the social hash-tagging behavior in Twitter. Our experimental evaluation on a dataset, collected in real-time during the EHEC outbreak, shows the superior ranking performance of PTR4EI. We believe our work can serve as a building block for an open early warning system based on Twitter, helping to realize the vision of Epidemic Intelligence for the Crowd, by the Crowd.},

In this paper, we model a social tagging system as a multi-type graph and propose a graph-based ranking algorithm called HeterRank for tag recommendation.

In this poster, we report initial results of a domain adaptive answer extractor that performs the extraction in two steps: a) an answer recognizer identifies the sentences in a post which are likely to be answers, and b) a domain relevance module determines the domain significance of the identified answer. We use domain independent methodology that can be easily adapted to any given domain with minimum effort.},

Previous studies either consider latent feature based models but disregarding local structure in the network, or focus exclusively on capturing local structure of objects based on latent blockmodels without coupling with latent characteristics of objects. To combine the benefits of previous work, we propose a novel model that can incorporate the effects of latent features of objects and local structure in the network simultaneously. To achieve this, we model the relation graph as a function of both latent feature factors and latent cluster memberships of objects to collectively discover globally predictive intrinsic properties of objects and capture latent block structure in the network to improve prediction performance. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the other state of the art approaches for link prediction.},

abstract = {Current online social networking (OSN) sites pose severe risks to their users' privacy. Facebook in particular is capturing more and more of a user's past activities, sometimes starting from the day of birth. Instead of transiently passing on information between friends, a user's data is stored persistently and therefore subject to the risk of undesired disclosure. Traditionally, a regular user of a social network has little awareness of her privacy needs in the Web or is not ready to invest a considerable effort in securing her online activities. Furthermore, the centralised nature of proprietary social networking platforms simply does not cater for end-to-end privacy protection mechanisms. In this paper, we present a non-disruptive and lightweight integration of a confidentiality mechanism into OSNs. Additionally, direct integration of visual security indicators into the OSN UI raise the awareness for (un)protected content and thus their own privacy. We present a fully-working prototype for Facebook and an initial usability study, showing that, on average, untrained users can be ready to use the service in three minutes.},

We present an approach to a priori population of such caches with Linked Data harvested from the Web, seeded by a simple context model for each user, which is progressively enriched by executing a series of enrichment rules over Linked Data from the Web. Such caches can act as personal data stores supporting a range of different applications. A comprehensive user evaluation demonstrates that our approach can accurately predict the relevance of attributes added to the context model and the execution probability of queries based on these attributes, thereby optimizing the cache population process.},

abstract = {The critical path of a composite Web application operating in volatile environments, i.e., the execution path in the service composition with the maximum execution time, should be prioritised in cost-effective monitoring as it determines the response time of the Web application. In volatile operating environments, the critical path of a Web application is probabilistic. As such, it is important to estimate the criticalities of the execution paths, i.e., the probabilities that they are critical, to decide which parts of the system to monitor. We propose a novel approach to the identification of Probabilistic Critical Path for Service-based Web Applications (PCP-SWA), which calculates the criticalities of different execution paths in the context of service composition. We evaluate PCP-SWA experimentally using an example Web application. Compared to random monitoring, PCP-SWA based monitoring is 55.67% more cost-effective on average.},

Also, it is non-supervised, requiring little intervention from the user. Furthermore, we do not need to crawl extensively a site to build a classifier for that site, but only a small subset of pages. We have performed an experiment over 21 highly visited websites to evaluate the performance of our classifier, obtaining good precision and recall results.},

One commonly-used activity of SNS users is to track and observe the representative social and temporal behaviors of other individuals. This inspires us to propose a new problem of Temporal Social Behavior Search (TSBS) from social interactions in an information network: given a structural query with associated temporal labels, how to find the subgraph instances satisfying the query structure and temporal requirements? In TSBS, a query can be (a) a topological structure, (b) the partially-assigned individuals on nodes, and/or (c) the temporal sequential labels on edges. The TSBS method consists of two parts: offline mining and online matching. to the former mines the temporal subgraph patterns for retrieving representative structures that match the query. Then based on the given query, we perform the online structural matching on the mined patterns and return the top-k resulting subgraphs. Experiments on academic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TSBS.},

A novel recommendation system, TripRec, is proposed to allow users to pecify starting/end and must-go locations. It further provides the flexibility to satisfy certain time constraint (i.e., the expected duration of the trip). By considering a sequence of check-in points as a route, we mine the frequent sequences with some ranking mechanism to achieve the goal. Our TripRec targets at travelers who are unfamiliar to the objective area/city and have time constraints in the trip.},

It maps queries and documents into a concept space spanned by these word pairs. The second model, called Bilingual Paired Topic Model (BPTM), uses bilingual word pairs and jointly models a bilingual query-document collection. This model maps queries and documents in multiple languages into a lower dimensional semantic subspace. Experimental results on web search task show that they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline models, and the best result is obtained by interpolating PairModel and BPTM.},

Hence, presenting high quality reviews is crucial in achieving a high level of customer satisfaction. Towards this direction, in this work, we introduce a new dimension of review quality, the reviewer's "trustfulness". We assume that voluntary information provided by Amazon reviewers, regarding whether they are the actual buyers of the product, signals the reliability of a review. Based on this information, we characterize a reviewer as trustworthy (positive instance) or of unknown "trustfulness" (unlabeled instance). Then, we build models that exploit reviewers' profile information and on-line behavior to rank them according to the probability of being trustworthy. Our results are very promising, since they provide evidence that our predictive models separate positive from unlabeled instances with very high accuracies.},

Manual content analysis conducted by experts is the standard way in political and social science to detect this bias. In this paper we present an automated approach relying on methods from information retrieval and corpus statistics to identify biased vocabulary use. As an example, we analyzed 15 years of parliamentary speeches of the German Bundestag and we investigated whether there is bias towards a political party in major national online newspapers and magazines. The results show that bias exists with respect to vocabulary use and it coincides with human judgement.},

In this way, as there will be many functionally-equivalent services for a specific user task, the service non-functional aspect should be considered for filtering and choosing the appropriate services. The related approaches in service discovery mainly concentrate on exploiting constraint solving techniques for inferring if the user non-functional requirements are satisfied by the service nonfunctional capabilities. However, as the matchmaking time is proportional to the number of non-functional service descriptions, these approaches fail to fulfill the user request in a timely manner. To this end, two alternative techniques for improving the non-functional service matchmaking time have been developed. The first one is generic as it can handle non-functional service specifications containing n-ary constraints, while the second is only applicable to unary-constrained specifications. Both techniques were experimentally evaluated. The preliminary evaluation results show that the service matchmaking time is significantly improved without compromising matchmaking accuracy.},

People who are "close" in some sense in a social network are more likely to perform similar actions than more distant people. We use network proximity to capture the degree to which people are "close" to each other. In addition to standard proximity metrics used in the link prediction task, such as neighborhood overlap, we introduce new metrics that model different types of interactions that take place between people. We study this claim empirically using data about URL forwarding activity on the social media sites Digg and Twitter. We show that structural proximity of two users in the follower graph is related to similarity of their activity, i.e., how many URLs they both forward. We also show that given friends' activity, knowing their proximity to the user can help better predict which URLs the user will forward. We compare the performance of different proximity metrics on the activity prediction task and find that metrics that take into account the attention-limited nature of interactions in social media lead to substantially better predictions.},

abstract = {Influence propagation and maximization is a well-studied problem in social network mining. However, most of the previous works focus only on homogeneous social networks where nodes and links are of single type. This work aims at defining information propagation for heterogeneous social networks (containing multiple types of nodes and links). We propose to consider the individual behaviors of persons to model the influence propagation. Person nodes possess different influence probabilities to activate their friends according to their interaction behaviors. The proposed model consists of two stages. First, based on the heterogeneous social network, we create a human-based influence graph where nodes are of human-type and links carry weights that represent how special the target node is to the source node. Second, we propose two entropy-based heuristics to identify the disseminators in the influence graph to maximize the influence spread. Experimental results show promising results for the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper aims to combine the viral marketing with the idea of direct selling to for influence maximization in a social network. In direct selling, producers can sell the products directly to the consumers without having to go through a cascade of wholesalers. Through direct selling, it is possible to sell the products in a more efficient and economic manner. Motivated by this idea, we propose a target-selecting independent cascade (TIC) model, in which during influence propagation each active node can give up to attempt to influence some neighboring nodes, named victims, who could be hard to affect, and try to activate some of its friends of friends, termed destinations, who could have higher potential to increase the influence spread. Thus, the next question to ask is that given a social network and a set of seeds for influence propagation under TIC model, how to select targets (i.e., victims and destinations) for the attempts of activation during the propagation to boost of influence spread. We propose and evaluate three heuristics for the target selection. Experiments show that selecting targets based on influence probability between nodes have the highest boost of influence spread.},

We are given a social network and some sample nodes which is supposed to belong to a specific region, and the goal is to obtain a subgraph that contains the sampled nodes with other nodes in the same region. Such regional subgraph discovery can benefit region-based applications, including scholar search, friend suggestion, and viral marketing. To deal with this problem, we assume there is a hidden backbone connecting the query nodes directly or indirectly in their region. The idea is that individuals belonging to the same region tend to share similar interests and cultures. By modeling such fact on edge weights, we search the graph to extract the regional backbone with respect to the query nodes. Then we can expand the backbone to derive the regional network. Experiments on a DBLP co-authorship network show the proposed method can effectively discover the regional subgraph with high precision scores.},

The recent work of b-bit minwise hashing provided a substantial improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value. Both minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing require an expensive preprocessing step for applying k (e.g., k=500) permutations on the entire data in order to compute k minimal values as the hashed data. In this paper, we developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs, which reduced the processing time by a factor of 20-80. Reducing the preprocessing time is highly beneficial in practice, for example, for duplicate web page detection (where minwise hashing is a major step in the crawling pipeline) or for increasing the testing speed of online classifiers (when the test data are not preprocessed).},

Particularly, the parameters of the Expected Reciprocal Rank measure are the normalized parameters of the DCG metric, and the latter are chosen in an ad-hoc manner. We suggest two approaches for adjusting parameters of the ERR model by analyzing real users behaviour: one based on a controlled experiment and another relying on search log analysis. We show that our approaches generate parameters that are largely different from the commonly used parameters of the ERR model.},

abstract = {Most state-of-the art approaches for securing XML documents allow users to access data only through authorized views defined by annotating an XML grammar (e.g. DTD) with a collection of XPath expressions. To prevent improperdisclosure of confidential information, user queries posed on these views need to be rewritten into equivalent queries on the underlying documents, which enables us to avoid the overhead of view materialization and maintenance. A major concern here is that XPath query rewriting for recursive XML views is still an open problem. To overcome this problem, some authors have proposed rewriting approaches based on the non-standard language, "Regular XPath", which is more expressive than XPath and makes rewriting possible under recursion. However, query rewriting under Regular XPath can be of exponential size as it relies on automaton model. Most importantly, Regular XPath remains a theoretical achievement. Indeed, it is not commonly used in practice as translation and evaluation tools are not available. In this work, we show that query rewriting is always possible for recursive XML views using only the expressive power of the standard XPath. We propose a general approach for securely querying of XML data under arbitrary security views (recursive or not) and for a significant fragment of XPath. We provide a linear rewriting algorithm that is efficient and scales well.},

Also, it maintains a list of alternative ride givers so as to almost guarantee a ride for the ride taker. This solution uses a SPARQL-based continuous query framework that is capable of sensing fast-changing real-time situation. It also has reasoning capabilities for handling ride taker's preferences. The paper introduces the concept of user-managed windows that is shown to be required for this solution. Finally we show that the performance of the application is enhanced by designing the application with short incremental queries.},

However, YouTube comments made by native speakers on Yoruba movies combine English language, Yoruba language, and other commonly used "pidgin" Yoruba language words. Since Yoruba is still a resource constrained language, existing sentiment or subjectivity analysis algorithms have poor performances on YouTube comments made on Yoruba language movies. This is because of the constrained language ambiguities. In this work, we present an automatic sentiment analysis algorithm for YouTube comments on Yoruba language movies. The algorithm uses SentiWordNet thesaurus and a lexicon of commonly used Yoruba language sentiment words and phrases. In terms of precision-recall, the algorithm performs more than a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis technique by up to 20%.},

Such a framework supports document clustering, labeling, and search, with respect to contextual knowledge contained in the document collection. To realize the framework, we introduce an approach to project documents into a context-feature space. Then, dimensionality reduction is used to extract contextual topics in this context-feature space. The topics can then be projected back onto the documents.

abstract = {Most studies on social influence have focused on direct influence, while another interesting question can be raised as whether indirect influence exists between two users who're not directly connected in the network and what affects such influence. In addition, the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users. Our observation of intensity of indirect influence, propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability on Twitter, shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally. In other words, the retweeting probability increases non-monotonically with some local drops.},

In this work we extend the lexical word based translation model to incorporate semantic concepts.

This problem is more severe when the users are non-native speakers of English due to differences in pronunciations. In this paper, we describe a novel, intelligent speech interface design approach for IR tasks that is significantly robust to accent variations. Our solution uses phonemic similarity based word spreading and semantic information based filtering to boost the accuracy of any ASR. We evaluated our solution with Google Voice as the ASR for a web question-answering system developed in-house and the results are very encouraging.},

In this paper, we formulate a general Dynamical Information Retrieval problem, where we consider retrieval as a stochastic, controllable process. The ranking action continuously controls the retrieval system's dynamics and an optimal ranking policy is found that maximizes the overall users' satisfaction during each period. Through deriving the posterior probability of the documents evolving relevancy from user clicks, we can provide a plug-in framework for incorporating a number of click models, which can be combined with Multi-Armed Bandit theory and Portfolio Theory of IR to create a dynamic ranking rule that takes rank bias and click dependency into account. We verify the versatility of our algorithms in a number of experiments and demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines and as a result significant performance gains have been achieved.},

Photo tagging --- and more broadly face-recognition algorithms --- often escapes to the users' control and creates links between private situations and their public profile. To address this issue, we designed a geo-location aided system to let users declare their tagging preferences directly when the picture is taken. We present Photo-Tagging Preference Enforcement (Photo-TaPE) a system enforcing users tagging preferences without revealing their identity. By improving face-recognition efficiency, Photo-TaPE can guarantee the user tagging preferences in 67% of the cases and significantly reduces the processing time of face-recognition algorithms.},

We show here how to acquire a large stereotype lexicon from Web content, and further show how to determine sentiment ratings for each entry in the lexicon, both at the level of properties and behaviors and at the level of stereotypes. Finally, we show how the properties of a stereotype can be segregated on demand, to place a positive or negative spin on a word in context.},

The limitation is that it can only represent static information, but cannot easily encode revisions of semantic web and knowledge evolution. In reality, knowledge does not stay still but evolves over time. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of "quintuple representation" by adding two new fields, state and time, where state has two values, either in or out, to denote that the referred knowledge takes effective or becomes expired at the given time. We then discuss a two-step statistical framework to mine knowledge evolution into the proposed quintuple representation. Utilizing extracted quintuple properly, it not only can reveal knowledge changing history but also detect expired information. We evaluate the proposed framework on Wikipedia revisions, as well as, common web pages currently not in semantic web format.},

abstract = {Online reviews play a crucial role in today's electronic commerce. Due to the pervasive spam reviews, customers can be misled to buy low-quality products, while decent stores can be defamed by malicious reviews. We observe that, in reality, a great portion (&gt; 90% in the data we study) of the reviewers write only one review (singleton review). These reviews are so enormous in number that they can almost determine a store's rating and impression. However, existing methods ignore these reviewers. To address this problem, we observe that the normal reviewers' arrival pattern is stable and uncorrelated to their rating pattern temporally. In contrast, spam attacks are usually bursty and either positively or negatively correlated to the rating. Thus, we propose to detect such attacks via unusually correlated temporal patterns. We identify and construct multidimensional time series based on aggregate statistics, in order to depict and mine such correlation. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting singleton review attacks. We discover that singleton review is a significant source of spam reviews and largely affects the ratings of online stores.},

abstract = {Web Person Disambiguation is often conducted through clustering web documents to identify different namesakes for a given name. This paper presents a new key-phrased clustering method combined with a second step re-classification to identify outliers to improve cluster performance. For document clustering, the hierarchical agglomerative approach is conducted based on the vector space model which uses key phrases as the main feature. Outliers of cluster results are then identified through a centroids-based method. The outliers are then reclassified by the SVM classifier into the more appropriate clusters using a key phrase-based string kernel model as its feature space. The re-classification uses the clustering result in the first step as its training data so as to avoid the use of separate training data required by most classification algorithms. Experiments conducted on the WePS-2 dataset show that the algorithm based on key phrases is effective in improving the WPD performance.},

abstract = {So far, many researchers have worked on recommender systems using users' implicit feedback, since it is difficult to collect explicit item preferences in most applications. Existing researches generally use a pseudo-rating matrix by adding up the number of item consumption; however, this naive approach may not capture user preferences correctly in that many other important user activities are ignored. In this paper, we show that users' diverse implicit feedbacks can be significantly used to improve recommendation accuracy. We classify various users' behaviors (e.g., search item, skip, add to playlist, etc.) into positive or negative feedback groups and construct more accurate pseudo-rating matrix. Our preliminary experimental result shows significant potential of our approach. Also, we bring out a question to the previous approaches, aggregating item usage count into ratings.},

abstract = {Welcome to the First International Workshop on Social Web for Disaster Management.While traditionally a handful of news channels report updates, recently citizens and organizations have used multiple communication channels to share, predict, detect, discuss and report on large-scale events. Prime examples are the communications patterns and sharing motifs that emerged shortly after the London underground bombings (cell-phone based updates), Hurricane Katrina (Craigslist), or the Hudson River plane crash (Twitter). Existing approaches to mining public feeds are primarily aimed at searching for specific information or providing general trends within the whole dataset, and crucially post event (e.g. time or location based crowd clustering). To enable effective management of large-scale events, whether natural or economic disasters, there is a need for advances in situational awareness and reduction in response times in disaster management processes. In order to achieve that, a system needs to go beyond using post-event system-generated data, and incorporate both algorithm and crowdsourcing techniques to gather, analyze, organize and then visualize Web data and activity around an event in real-time.We are excited about the variety of papers that are included in the workshop program reflecting the global momentum in research in this domain. The selected works address a number of key topics in this space, such as, making sense of social Web Data in disasters, mining community generated feeds to obtain situational awareness of the events, modeling global events from a variety of Web sources, and Web-platforms for disaster management. These papers present interesting approaches to cross-referencing, summarizing and presenting social Web in consumable manner to address case studies from recent disasters. Position papers in this workshop pave the way for stimulating discussion about future of Social Web and its applications to increased disaster awareness and accelerated response.},

In microblogging services, many short messages are posted every day and some of them represent replies or forwarded messages between users. We extract such conversational messages to link the users as a user network and regard the strongly-connected components in the network as indicators of user communities. However, using all of the microblog data for user community extraction is too costly and requires too much storage space when decomposing strongly-connected components. In contrast, using sampled data may miss some user connections and thus divide one user community into pieces. In this paper, we propose a method for user community reconstruction using the lexical similarity of the messages and the user's link information between separate communities.},

The methodology combines location based division of users together with standard text mining (term frequency inverse document frequency) to identify important topics of conversation in a dynamic geographic network. We further suggest that both topics and movement patterns change during a disaster, which requires identification of new trends. When applied to an area that has suffered a disaster, this approach can provide 'sensemaking' through insights into where people are located, where they are going and what they communicate when moving.},

In this paper, we examine how news about these disasters spreads on the social network. In addition to this, we also examine the countries of the Tweeting users. We examine Twitter logs from the 2010 Philippines typhoon, the 2011 Brazil flood and the 2011 Japan earthquake. We find that although news about the disaster may be initiated in multiple places in the social network, it quickly finds a core community that is interested in the disaster, and has little chance to escape the community via social network links alone. We also find evidence that the world at large expresses concern about such largescale disasters, and not just countries geographically proximate to the epicenter of the disaster. Our analysis has implications for the design of fund raising campaigns through social networking websites.},

The question one asks about this phenomenon is that whether these rumors can be suppressed using suitable mechanisms. One of the possible solutions is to inoculate a certain fraction of nodes against rumors. The inoculation can be done randomly or in targeted fashion. In this paper, small world network model has been used to investigate the efficiency of inoculation. It has been found that if average degree of small world network is small than both inoculation methods are successful. When average degree is large, neither of these methods are able to stop rumor spreading. But if acceptability of rumor is reduced along with inoculation, the rumor spreading can be stopped even in this case.The proposed hypothesis has been verified using simulation experiments.},

It provides a high level abstraction of phenomenon such that applications can express diverse data needs in a declarative fashion. MECA coordinates the data collection and primitive processing activities, so that data can be shared among applications. It addresses the inefficiency issues in the current vertical integration approach. We showcase the benefits of MECA by means of a disaster management application.},

abstract = {The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) collects near real-time hazard information to provide global multi-hazard disaster alerting for earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones, floods and volcanoes. GDACS alerts are based on calculations from physical disaster parameters and used by emergency responders. In 2011, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission started exploring if and how social media could be an additional valuable data source for international disaster response. The question is if awareness of the situation after a disaster could be improved by the use of social media tools and data. In order to explore this, JRC developed a Twitter account and Facebook page for the dissemination of GDACS alerts, a Twitter parser for the monitoring of information and a mobile application for information exchange. This paper presents the Twitter parser and the intermediate results of the data analysis which shows that the parsing of Twitter feeds (so-called tweets) can provide important information about side effects of disasters, on the perceived impact of a hazard and on the reaction of the affected population. The most important result is that impact information on collapsed buildings were detected through tweets within the first half an hour after an earthquake occurred and before any mass media reported the collapse.},

abstract = {We are pleased to present the proceedings of the XperienceWeb 2012 workshop, which was held as part of the World Wide Web 2012 Conference in Lyon, April 2012.This workshop has evolved out of the webCBR workshop series, which primarily promotes the application of case-based reasoning (CBR) to experiential content on the web. Clearly such content is on the increase with advances in web technology resulting in vast amounts of user generated web content in the form of blogs, tweets, forums and opinion sites. Whilst such content can be treated as documents we take the view that they are more appropriately viewed as a rich source of untapped experience data, a valuable asset that can be used to generate Web experience bases through CBR technology.The key idea in CBR involves the reuse of similar experiences to resolve new problems. Such reasoning is relevant to the web because increasingly people search and browse other people's experiences on travel, medicine, retail, entertainment, etc., for their informational and problem solving needs. Typically this vast repository of untapped knowledge and experience exists in unstructured text and multimedia forms. These rich informational snippets generally describe a particular problem situation often combined with a reflective narrative consisting of decisions made, lessons learnt and opinions expressed. Such content forms a rich source of untapped experience data - an integral resource for problem solving with CBR. For example, if one wants to identify web content that helps them to achieve a particular task (say software configuration and installation), then it is likely that there will be many related user posts describing experiences on similar tasks and crucially include suitable solutions to address such a task. We therefore envisage a new form of user need, one that possibly embodies knowledge, meaning and understanding as opposed to chunks of keywords for queries and snippets. Addressing this need calls for novel extraction, representation, retrieval and assembly strategies from existing experiential content on the web.The focus of this workshop was to provide a forum for the discussion of trends, research issues and practical experiences on the role of tools and technologies in reasoning with web-related experiential content. Six papers were accepted for the workshop, covering a wide range of web experience data. Adekyanju et al. present an approach for combining knowledge from web data and search logs for query recommendation. Kato et al. propose a method for extracting onomatopoeia from restaurant reviews and using these in a restaurant recommender. Schumacher et al. compare two methods for extracting procedural or 'how-to' knowledge from the web and Zarka et al. look at the potential for experiential approaches to recommendation to enable a more context-aware method of generating useful video recommendations, particularly in relation to temporal context.Two of the accepted papers are position papers. The question of how user-generated content can be mined successfully for solutions to specific problems is discussed by Sauer &amp; Roth-Berghofer while Gorg et al. consider the problem of constructing and managing personal workflows over a social network.},

In addition, we propose a system that can present the user with a list of onomatopoeia specific to a restaurant she is interested in. The evaluation results indicate that an intuitive restaurant search can be done via a list of onomatopoeia, and that they are helpful for selecting food or restaurants.},

We do so under the premise of mapping the split view on context, introduced by Br\'{e}zillon and Pomerol, onto three different levels of abstraction of a problem domain. This is done to integrate the notion of activity or focus and its influence on the context into the mining for a solution. We assume that a problem's context describes key characteristics to be decisive criteria in the mining process to mine successful solutions for it. We further detail on the process of a chain of sub problems and their foci adding up to a meta problem solution and how this can used to mine for such solutions. Through a guiding example we introduce basic steps of the solution mining process and common aspects we deem interesting to be analysed closer in upcoming research on solution mining. We further examine the possible integration of these newly established outlines for automatic solution mining for highly specific problems into a SEASALTexp, a currently developed architecture for explanation-aware extraction and case-based processing of experiences from Internet communities. We thereby gained first insights in issues occurring while trying to integrate automatic solution mining.},

This paper is on a comparison of two extraction methods for procedural knowledge from the Web. Both methods create workflow representations automatically from text with the aim to reuse the Web experience by reasoning methods. Two variants of the workflow extraction process are introduced and evaluated by experiments with cooking recipes as a sample domain. The first variant is a term-based approach that integrates standard information extraction methods from the GATE system. The second variant is a frame-based approach that is implemented by means of the SUNDANCE system. The expert assessment of the extraction results clearly shows that the more sophisticated frame-based approach outperforms the term-based approach of automated workflow extraction.},

abstract = {Query recommendation is becoming a common feature of web search engines especially those for Intranets where the context is more restrictive. This is because of its utility for supporting users to find relevant information in less time by using the most suitable query terms. Selection of queries for recommendation is typically done by mining web documents or search logs of previous users. We propose the integration of these approaches by combining two models namely the concept hierarchy, typically built from an Intranet's documents, and the query flow graph, typically built from search logs. However, we build our concept hierarchy model from terms extracted from a subset (training set) of search logs since these are more representative of the user view of the domain than any concepts extracted from the collection. We then continually adapt the model by incorporating query refinements from another subset (test set) of the user search logs. This process implies learning from or reusing previous users' querying experience to recommend queries for a new but similar user query. The adaptation weights are extracted from a query flow graph built with the same logs. We evaluated our hybrid model using documents crawled from the Intranet of an academic institution and its search logs. The hybrid model was then compared to a concept hierarchy model and query flow graph built from the same collection and search logs respectively. We also tested various strategies for combining information in the search logs with respect to the frequency of clicked documents after query refinement. Our hybrid model significantly outperformed the concept hierarchy model and query flow graph when tested over two different periods of the academic year. We intend to further validate our experiments with documents and search logs from another institution and devise better strategies for selecting queries for recommendation from the hybrid model.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to CQA 2012, the first Community Question Answering (CQA) workshop, under the umbrella of the WWW 2012 conference held in Lyon, France.Background: Despite the continuous progress of Web search engines in the last 20 years, many users' needs still remain unanswered. Two common reasons for queries not being satisfied are (1) the intent behind the query not being well expressed, and (2) the absence of relevant content. Subjective or narrow needs, for which content was not created before the need was expressed, will keep appearing no matter how Web search engines progress. This innate limitation of web search engines has led to the emergence of Community Question Answering (CQA) services in the last decade, such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Zhidao, Quora, Facebook Questions, and many topic-specific forums such as Stack Overflow. These services are designed to help users obtain information from a community, offering a wide variety of approaches (e.g., broadcasting the question to the whole community, just directed to friends, or specifically targeted to topic experts). Most importantly, these sites serve an active community of millions of users, and continue generating a great deal of popular Web content.Goals: While CQA services have been active for almost a decade, and are a popular subject of multiple research studies and publications in a variety of Web-related conferences, they have not, to the best of our knowledge, been a focus of a dedicated workshop in a top conference. The goal of this workshop was to bring together, for the first time, researchers and practitioners from various areas working on CQA. This workshop was specifically designed for the broad WWW audience. Yet, our goal was to also conduct a more focused discussion, and to consider the latest work in progress in the area of Community Question Answering.Process: We issued a call for papers and requested the assistance of a Program Committee of 11 renowned experts to carefully review the paper submissions. They are listed on the next page. We are deeply grateful to all of them for their thorough and insightful reviews.Themes: The themes of our workshop call for papers were diverse and included topics such as question routing, question recommendation, spam and abuse detection techniques, personalization and recommendation, user modeling, monetization, and connections of CQA with search, evaluation, and social network research. The papers that were accepted by our Program Committee could be clustered around 4 main areas: (1) quality (2) routing (3) discovery and (4) users. In addition, Sep Kamvar, Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, and the Director of the Social Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab, agreed to open the workshop as our keynote speaker and discuss Language, Thought and Community Question Answering.We hope that you will find the workshop interesting and thought provoking. Our goal was not only to provide the opportunity for researchers and practitioners in the Web community to share ideas, but also to foster new research and innovation in the fascinating field of CQA.The Official Web site of the workshop is http://research.yahoo.com/workshops/cqa2012},

Most existing works in this area focus on using various features or employing machine learning techniques to address this problem. Only a few of them noticed and involved user profile information in this particular task. In this work, we assume the close relationship between user profile information and the quality of their answers under the ground truth that user information records the user behaviors and histories as a summary. Thus, we exploited the effectiveness of three categories of user profile information, i.e. engagement-related, authority-related and level-related, on answer ranking in cQA. Different from previous work, we only employed the information which is easy to extract without any limitations, such as user privacy. Experimental results on Yahoo! Answers manner questions showed that our system by using the user profile information achieved comparable or even better results over the state-of-the-art baseline system. Moreover, we found that the picture existence of a user in cQA community contributed more than other information in the answer ranking task.},

abstract = {Users tend to ask and answer questions in community question answering (CQA) services to seek information and share knowledge. A corollary is that myriad of questions and answers appear in CQA service. Accordingly, volumes of studies have been taken to explore the answer quality so as to provide a preliminary screening for better answers. However, to our knowledge, less attention has so far been paid to question quality in CQA. Knowing question quality provides us with finding and recommending good questions together with identifying bad ones which hinder the CQA service. In this paper, we are conducting two studies to investigate the question quality issue. The first study analyzes the factors of question quality and finds that the interaction between askers and topics results in the differences of question quality. Based on this finding, in the second study we propose a Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (MRLP) algorithm to predict question quality. We experiment with Yahoo!~Answers data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in distinguishing high-quality questions from low-quality ones.},

abstract = {Community-based Question and Answering (CQA) services have brought users to a new era of knowledge dissemination by allowing users to ask questions and to answer other users' questions. However, due to the fast increasing of posted questions and the lack of an effective way to find interesting questions, there is a serious gap between posted questions and potential answerers. This gap may degrade a CQA service's performance as well as reduce users' loyalty to the system. To bridge the gap, we present a new approach to Question Routing, which aims at routing questions to participants who are likely to provide answers. We consider the problem of question routing as a classification task, and develop a variety of local and global features which capture different aspects of questions, users, and their relations. Our experimental results obtained from an evaluation over the Yahoo!~Answers dataset demonstrate high feasibility of question routing. We also perform a systematical comparison on how different types of features contribute to the final results and show that question-user relationship features play a key role in improving the overall performance.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) websites provide a rapidly growing source of information in many areas. This rapid growth, while offering new opportunities, puts forward new challenges. In most CQA implementations there is little effort in directing new questions to the right group of experts. This means that experts are not provided with questions matching their expertise, and therefore new matching questions may be missed and not receive a proper answer. We focus on finding experts for a newly posted question. We investigate the suitability of two statistical topic models for solving this issue and compare these methods against more traditional Information Retrieval approaches. We show that for a dataset constructed from the Stackoverflow website, these topic models outperform other methods in retrieving a candidate set of best experts for a question. We also show that the Segmented Topic Model gives consistently better performance compared to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model.},

abstract = {Recently, query suggestions have become quite useful in web searches. Most provide additional and correct terms based on the initial query entered by users. However, query suggestions often recommend queries that differ from the user's search intentions due to different contexts. In such cases, faceted query expansions and their usages are quite efficient. In this paper, we propose faceted query expansion methods using the resources of Community Question Answering (CQA), which is social network service (SNS) that shares user knowledge. In a CQA site, users can post questions in a suitable category. Others answer them based on the category framework. Thus, the CQA "category" makes a "facet" of the query expansion. In addition, the time of year when the question was posted plays an important role in understanding its context. Thus, such seasonality creates another "facet" of the query expansion. We implement two-dimensional faceted query expansion methods based on the results of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis of CQA resources. The question articles deriving query expansion are provided for choosing appropriate terms by users. Our sophisticated evaluations using actual and long-term CQA resources, such as "Yahoo! CHIEBUKURO," demonstrate that most parts of the CQA questions are posted in periodicity and in bursts.},

abstract = {We use Yahoo!~Toolbar data to gain insights into why people use Q&amp;A sites. For this purpose we look at tens of thousands of questions asked on both Yahoo!~Answers and on Wiki Answers. We analyze both the pre-question behavior of users as well as their general online behavior. Using an existing approach (Harper et al.), we classify questions into "informational" vs. "conversational". Finally, for a subset of users on Yahoo! Answers we also integrate age and gender into our analysis. Our results indicate that there is a one-dimensional spectrum of users ranging from "social users" to "informational users". In terms of demographics, we found that both younger and female users are more "social" on this scale, with older and male users being more "informational".Concerning the pre-question behavior, users who first issue a question-related query, and especially those who do not click any web results, are more likely to issue informational questions than users who do not search before. Questions asked shortly after the registration of a new user on Yahoo! Answers tend to be social and have a lower probability of being preceded by a web search than other questions.Finally, we observed evidence both for and against topical congruence between a user's questions and his web queries.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers, are specifically designed to address the innate limitation of Web search engines by helping users obtain information from a community. Understanding the user intent of questions would enable a CQA system identify similar questions, find relevant answers, and recommend potential answerers more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose to classify questions into three categories according to their underlying user intent: subjective, objective, and social. In order to identify the user intent of a new question, we build a predictive model through machine learning based on both text and metadata features. Our investigation reveals that these two types of features are conditionally independent and each of them is sufficient for prediction. Therefore they can be exploited as two views in co-training - a semi-supervised learning framework - to make use of a large amount of unlabelled questions, in addition to the small set of manually labelled questions, for enhanced question classification. The preliminary experimental results show that co-training works significantly better than simply pooling these two types of features together.},

abstract = {One of the important targets of community-based question answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers, Quora and Baidu Zhidao, is to maintain and even increase the number of active answerers, that is the users who provide answers to open questions. The reasoning is that they are the engine behind satisfied askers, which is the overall goal behind CQA. Yet, this task is not an easy one. Indeed, our empirical observation shows that many users provide just one or two answers and then leave. In this work we try to detect answerers that are about to quit, a task known as churn prediction, but unlike prior work, we focus on new users. To address the task of churn prediction in new users, we extract a variety of features to model the behavior of YA{} users over the first week of their activity, including personal information, rate of activity, and social interaction with other users. Several classifiers trained on the data show that there is a statistically significant signal for discriminating between users who are likely to churn and those who are not. A detailed feature analysis shows that the two most important signals are the total number of answers given by the user, closely related to the motivation of the user, and attributes related to the amount of recognition given to the user, measured in counts of best answers, thumbs up and positive responses by the asker.},

abstract = {The International Workshop Email 2012 on Messaging and Web of Data: Private meets Public (and vice-versa) was held on April 16th 2012 at 21st World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2012) in Lyon, France. The Email 2012 workshop brought together researchers and practitioners working on improving email and messaging, and its interconnection with web of data.The growing amount of public data available on the WWW is a new opportunity to improve Messaging systems (e.g. Email or Social Media) in multiple forms, such as message content, processing and presentation. This workshop is dedicated to exploring how public web data, such as identities, agendas, LinkedData, social networks or various information published on the web can meet private messaging data so as to bring new insight for users, and prevent errors or abuse. Reciprocally, messages can become public (e.g. public email archives, leaked email datasets, Twitter timelines), but have to implement web standards to be efficiently identified, distributed and linked. This private/public duality and potential versatility, applied to messages in general is the basis of this workshop, which goes beyond technical aspects and aims at exploring impacts on users' practices, interfaces and trust. The workshop is built on previous successful email workshops: Next Trends in Email (NextMail'11); Emails in e-Commerce and Enterprise Context (E3C 2009); and Enhanced Messaging (EMAIL-2008).Workshop outcome: The call for papers solicited original email research papers and short position/experience papers including posters and interactive demonstration submissions. In total, the workshop received seven submissions. Two of them have been withdrawn and five have been valid papers matching with the workshop topics. Each paper was independently peer reviewed by at least three members of the international program committee. Four papers were accepted: two full papers and two short papers.Full papers: The first paper, Context-sensitive Business Process Support Based On Emails, is from Thomas Burkhart, Dirk Werth and Peter Loos and presents finalized work on handling flexible business processes within the email. The second paper, Emails as Graph: Relation Discovery in Email Archive, by Michal Laclav\'{\i}k, Marek Ciglan, \v{S}tefan Dlugolinsk\'{y}, Martin \v{S}eleng and Ladislav Hluch\'{y} discusses representation of email archive as a graph or information network and entity relation discovery within such data structures.Short papers: The contribution from Vojtech Juhasz titled Full-text search in email archives using social evaluation presents work in progress focusing on new approach for email search on the level of email parts including linked web sources or attachments, and benefits of email social networks. The other short paper from Ga\"{e}lle Recourc\'{e} titled Interpreting Contact Details out of E-mail Signature Blocks discusses industrial perspective and application of email contacts extraction.Invited talk: We have also invited Uwe V. Riss from SAP Research with a talk eminently relevant to the topic of the workshop: Email between private use and organizational purpose.},

abstract = {Emails have become an eminent source of personal and organizational information. They are not only used for personal communication but also for the management of information and the coordination of activities within organizations. Email traffic also exhibits the social networks existing in organizations. However, the central problem, which we still face, is how to tap this rich source appropriately. Main problems in this respect are the personal character of emails (their privacy) and the mainly unstructured character of their contents. Since these two features are essential success factors for the use of email they cannot be simply ignored. Meanwhile there are various approaches to recover the hidden treasure and make the contained information available to information and process management. For example, semantic or mining technologies play a prominent role in this attempt. The paper gives an overview of different strategies to make organizational use of emails, also touching the role of privacy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach for representing an email archive in the form of a network, capturing the communication among users and relations among the entities extracted from the textual part of the email messages. We showcase the method on the Enron email corpus, from which we extract various entities and a social network. The extracted named entities (NE), such as people, email addresses and telephone numbers, are organized in a graph along with the emails in which they were found. The edges in the graph indicate relations between NEs and represent a co-occurrence in the same email part, paragraph, sentence or a composite NE. We study mathematical properties of the graphs so created and describe our hands-on experience with the processing of such structures. Enron Graph corpus contains a few million nodes and is large enough for experimenting with various graph-querying techniques, e.g. graph traversal or spread of activation. Due to its size, the exploitation of traditional graph processing libraries might be problematic as they keep the whole structure in the memory. We describe our experience with the management of such data and with the relation discovery among the extracted entities. The described experience might be valuable for practitioners and highlights several research challenges.},

However, these systems are not appropriate for SMEs, which are the most common enterprise type in Europe. Thus, the European research project Commius addresses the special needs of SMEs and characteristics of email communication, namely highly flexibility and unstructuredness. Commius turns the existing email-system into a structured process management framework. Each incoming email is autonomously matched to the corresponding business process and enhanced by proactive annotations. These context-sensitive annotations include recommendations for the most suitable following process steps. An underlying, self-adjusting recommendation model ensures most appropriate recommendations by observing the actual user behavior. This implies that the proposed process course is in no way obligatory. To provide a high degree of flexibility, any deviation from the given process structure is allowed.},

abstract = {Music information research (MIR) has been a fast growing field of research during the past decade. In traditional MIR, music-related information were extracted from the audio signal using signal processing techniques. These methods, however, cannot capture semantic information that is not encoded in the audio signal, but nonetheless essential to many consumers, e.g., the meaning of the lyrics of a song or the political motivation or background of a singer. The recent launches of Google Music, Amazon.com's Cloud Player and Apple's iCloud with iTunes' Scan and Match show the huge commercial interest behind music distribution and consumption. Given the fact that music is an omnipresent topic on the Web, techniques to mine the Web of Music are vital for music information research.In recent years, the emergence of various Web 2.0 platforms and services dedicated or related to the music and audio domain, like last.fm, YouTube, MusicBrainz, Pandora, or Echo Nest, has been providing novel and powerful, albeit noisy, sources for high level, semantic information on music artists, albums, songs, and others. The abundance of such information provided by the power of the crowd can therefore contribute to music information research and development considerably. On the other hand, the wealth of newly available, semantically meaningful information offered on Web 2.0 platforms also poses new challenges, e.g., dealing with the huge amount and the noisiness of this kind of data, various user biases, hacking, or the cold start problem.Another recent trend are innovative user interfaces to access the large amounts of music available on smart mobile devices that are always connected to the Web. Dealing with the vast amounts of music requires new interaction paradigms and intelligent services that provide, for example, personalized and context-aware music recommendations. The current emergence and confluence of these challenges make this an interesting field for researchers and industry practitioners alike.Addressing these challenges, the International Workshop on Advances in Music Information Research (AdMIRe) workshop served as a forum for theoretical and practical discussions of cutting edge research in the fields of music information extraction, retrieval, and recommendation in the Web of Music. The workshop brought together researchers and developers from the music and audio community, the multimedia community, and the Web mining community and further initiated interesting and fruitful discussions on the future of MIR.This year was AdMIRe's 4th edition, and we received a considerable number of high-quality submissions. A total of 14 submissions from 7 different countries have been reviewed by at least 4 reviewers each, and 9 papers have finally been accepted for publication and presentation at the workshop. They span a wide field, including topics such as Web-based data and microblogging mining, content-based music processing, music similarity and recommendation from hybrid sources, and new evaluation methods.},

abstract = {The emergence of social tagging websites such as Last.fm has provided new opportunities for learning computational models that automatically tag music. Researchers typically obtain music tags from the Internet and use them to construct machine learning models. Nevertheless, such tags are usually noisy and sparse. In this paper, we present a preliminary study that aims at refining (retagging) social tags by exploiting the content similarity between tracks and the semantic redundancy of the track-tag matrix. The evaluated algorithms include a graph-based label propagation method that is often used in semi-supervised learning and a robust principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm that has led to state-of-the-art results in matrix completion. The results indicate that robust PCA with content similarity constraint is particularly effective; it improves the robustness of tagging against three types of synthetic errors and boosts the recall rate of music auto-tagging by 7% in a real-world setting.},

abstract = {In this paper we compare the use of different musical representations for the task of version identification (i.e. retrieving alternative performances of the same musical piece). We automatically compute descriptors representing the melody and bass line using a state-of-the-art melody extraction algorithm, and compare them to a harmony-based descriptor. The similarity of descriptor sequences is computed using a dynamic programming algorithm based on nonlinear time series analysis which has been successfully used for version identification with harmony descriptors. After evaluating the accuracy of individual descriptors, we assess whether performance can be improved by descriptor fusion, for which we apply a classification approach, comparing different classification algorithms. We show that both melody and bass line descriptors carry useful information for version identification, and that combining them increases version detection accuracy. Whilst harmony remains the most reliable musical representation for version identification, we demonstrate how in some cases performance can be improved by combining it with melody and bass line descriptions. Finally, we identify some of the limitations of the proposed descriptor fusion approach, and discuss directions for future research.},

abstract = {Many sound-related applications use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to describe audio timbral content. Most of the research efforts dealing with MFCCs have been focused on the study of different classification and clustering algorithms, the use of complementary audio descriptors, or the effect of different distance measures. The goal of this paper is to focus on the statistical properties of the MFCC descriptor itself. For that purpose, we use a simple encoding process that maps a short-time MFCC vector to a dictionary of binary code-words. We study and characterize the rank-frequency distribution of such MFCC code-words, considering speech, music, and environmental sound sources. We show that, regardless of the sound source, MFCC code-words follow a shifted power-law distribution. This implies that there are a few code-words that occur very frequently and many that happen rarely. We also observe that the inner structure of the most frequent code-words has characteristic patterns. For instance, close MFCC coefficients tend to have similar quantization values in the case of music signals. Finally, we study the rank-frequency distributions of individual music recordings and show that they present the same type of heavy-tailed distribution as found in the large-scale databases. This fact is exploited in two supervised semantic inference tasks: genre and instrument classification. In particular, we obtain similar classification results as the ones obtained by considering all frames in the recordings by just using 50 (properly selected) frames. Beyond this particular example, we believe that the fact that MFCC frames follow a power-law distribution could potentially have important implications for future audio-based applications.},

abstract = {Reliable evaluation of Information Retrieval systems requires large amounts of relevance judgments. Making these annotations is quite complex and tedious for many Music Information Retrieval tasks, so performing such evaluations requires too much effort. A low-cost alternative is the application of Minimal Test Collection algorithms, which offer quite reliable results while significantly reducing the annotation effort. The idea is to incrementally select what documents to judge so that we can compute estimates of the effectiveness differences between systems with a certain degree of confidence. In this paper we show a first approach towards its application to the evaluation of the Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task, run by the annual MIREX evaluation campaign. An analysis with the MIREX 2011 data shows that the judging effort can be reduced to about 35% to obtain results with 95% confidence.},

MIR currently turns towards making recommendation systems adaptive to user preferences and context. Here, we consider the particular task of adapting music similarity measures to user voting data. This work builds on and responds to previous publications based on the MagnaTagATune dataset. We have reproduced the similarity dataset presented by Stober and N\"{u}rnberger at AMR 2011 to enable a comparison of approaches. On this dataset, we compare their two-level approach, defining similarity measures on individual facets and combining them in a linear model, to the Metric Learning to Rank (MLR) algorithm. MLR adapts a similarity measure that operates directly on low-level features to the user data. We compare the different algorithms, features and parameter spaces with regards to minimising constraint violations. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the MLR algorithm in generalising to unknown data is evaluated on this dataset. We also explore the effects of feature choice. Here, we find that the binary genre data shows little correlation with the similarity data, but combined with audio features it clearly improves generalisation.},

abstract = {You are about to read the proceedings of the International Workshop on Interoperability of User Profiles in Multi-Application Web Environments (MultiA-Pro 2012).Nowadays, many different websites and applications in different areas (elearning, digital libraries, search engines, e-commerce, social networks, ubiquitous computing, web of things) are gathering proprietary user profiles. These are gathered for the purpose of the subsequent provision of adaptive and personalized services to users.Although beneficial and having the potential to upgrade the personalized services provided to users, very little exchange of the gathered user profile information practically occurs between these sites and applications. This can be explained by various commercial and legal limitations. Firstly, commercial competition between companies prevents them from sharing the gathered user profiles. For example, e-commerce services like Amazon and eBay are primarily interested to improve their own service and refrain from establishing an interoperable environment and sharing their own profiles with the rival service. Secondly, many countries impose very stringent legal restrictions on the gathering and storage of personal user information and prohibit such a sharing. Meanwhile, for individual users, it is getting more and more difficult to manage in a secure and practical way their ever multiplying web identities.Overcoming these limitations and developing solutions and standards for multi-application user profiling and interoperability of user modeling and personalization applications is timely and important. This can allow future online service providers to gather richer and more accurate user profiles, and, as a result, facilitate the provision of high-quality personalized services to their users. Providing a standardized, transparent, usercentric and secured means for gathering, modeling, and management of user profiles would facilitate the adoption of user profile data interoperability and sharing in web-based user modeling and personalization applications.The aim of this workshop is to organize a common discussion among scientific and industrial research communities on the challenges evolving around multi-application user profiling and personalization on the web. The main objective is to set new standards and a strategic research agenda for researchers and web technology developers for aspects related to interoperability of user modeling and personalization systems.We received interesting papers, covering several aspects of user profile interoperability, and we are looking forward to a rich and constructive exchange around this topic.},

Although current social networks provide access to user profile data via dedicated APIs, they fail to provide accurate schema information, which aggravates the integration of user profiles, and not least the adaptation of applications in the face of schema evolution. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents, firstly, a semi-automatic approach to extract schema information from instance data. Secondly, transformations of the derived schemas to different technical spaces are utilized, thereby allowing, amongst other benefits, the application of established integration tools and methods. Finally, as a case study, schemas are derived for Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. The resulting schemas are analyzed (i) for completeness and correctness according to the documentation, and (ii) for semantic overlaps and heterogeneities amongst each other, building the basis for future user profile integration.},

abstract = {In the field of multi-application personalization, several techniques have been proposed to support user modeling for user data management across different applications. Many of them are based on data reconciliation techniques often implying the concepts of static ontologies and generic user data models. None of them have sufficiently investigated two main issues related to user modeling: (1) profile definition in order to allow every application to build their own view of users while promoting the sharing of these profiles and (2) profile evolution over time in order to avoid data inconsistency and the subsequent loss of income for web-site users and companies. In this paper, we conduct work and propose separated solutions for every issue. We propose a flexible user modeling system, not imposing any fixed user model whom different applications should conform to, but based on the concept of mapping among applications (and mapping functions among their user attributes). We focus in particular on the management of user profile data propagation, as a way to reduce the amount of inconsistent user profile information over several applications.A second goal of this paper is to illustrate, in this context, the benefit obtained by the integration of a Semantic Layer that can help application designers to automatically identify potential user attribute mappings between applications.This paper so illustrates a work-in-progress work where two complementary approaches are integrated to improve a main goal: managing multi-application user profiles in a semi-automatic manner.},

Content which has been authored and produced for general broadcast can take on additional commercial service features when personalised either for individual viewers or for groups of viewers participating in entertainment, training, gaming or informational activities. Although several scenarios and use-cases can be envisaged, we are focussed on the application of personalised product placement. Targeted advertising and product placement are currently garnering intense interest in the commercial networked media industries. Personalisation of product placement is a relevant and timely service for next generation online marketing and advertising and for many other revenue generating interactive services. This paper discusses the acquisition and insertion of media objects into a TV video play-out stream where the objects are determined by the profile of the viewer. The technology is based on MPEG-4 standards using object based video and MPEG-7 for metadata. No proprietary technology or protocol is proposed. To trade the objects into the video play-out, a Software-as-a-Service brokerage platform based on intelligent agent technology is adopted. Agencies, libraries and service providers are represented in a commercial negotiation to facilitate the contractual selection and usage of objects to be inserted into the video play-out.},

Obviously, platforms heterogeneity, user's preferences and context variations require documents adaptation according to execution constraints, e.g., audio contents may not be played while a user is participating at a meeting. Current context modeling languages do not handle such a real life user constraints. They generally list multiple information values that are interpreted by adaptation processes in order to deduce implicitly such high-level constraints. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing a novel context modeling approach based on services where context information are linked according to explicit high-level constraints. In order to validate our proposal, we have used Semantic Web technologies by specifying RDF profiles and experiment their usage on several platforms.},

That raises data management challenges which are addressed by biological, data mining and linked (web) data management communities. So far, mainly these domains were considered when identifying research topics and measuring approaches and progress. We argue that an important domain, the Business Network Management (BNM), representing business and (technical) integration data, implicitely linked and available in enterprises, has been neglected. Not only do enterprises need visibilities into their business networks, they need ad-hoc analysis capabilities on them. In this paper, we introduce BNM as domain, which comes with large scale network data. We discuss how linked business data can be made explicit by what we called Network Mining (NM) from dynamic, heterogeneous enterprise environments to combine it to a (cross-) enterprise linked business data network and state on its different facets w.r.t large network analysis and highlight challenges and opportunities.},

abstract = {To understand the structural dynamics of a large-scale social, biological or technological network, it may be useful to discover behavioral roles representing the main connectivity patterns present over time. In this paper, we propose a scalable non-parametric approach to automatically learn the structural dynamics of the network and individual nodes. Roles may represent structural or behavioral patterns such as the center of a star, peripheral nodes, or bridge nodes that connect different communities. Our novel approach learns the appropriate structural role dynamics for any arbitrary network and tracks the changes over time. In particular, we uncover the specific global network dynamics and the local node dynamics of a technological, communication, and social network. We identify interesting node and network patterns such as stationary and non-stationary roles, spikes/steps in role-memberships (perhaps indicating anomalies), increasing/decreasing role trends, among many others. Our results indicate that the nodes in each of these networks have distinct connectivity patterns that are non-stationary and evolve considerably over time. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for fast mining and tracking of the dynamics in large networks. Furthermore, the dynamic structural representation provides a basis for building more sophisticated models and tools that are fast for exploring large dynamic networks.},

abstract = {Sampling from large graphs is an area which is of great interest, particularly with the recent emergence of huge structures such as Online Social Networks. These often contain hundreds of millions of vertices and billions of edges. The large size of these networks makes it computationally expensive to obtain structural properties of the underlying graph by exhaustive search. If we can estimate these properties by taking small but representative samples from the network, then size is no longer a problem.In this paper we develop an analysis of random walks, a commonly used method of sampling from networks. We present a method of biassing the random walk to acquire a complete sample of high degree vertices of social networks, or similar graphs. The preferential attachment model is a common method to generate graphs with a power law degree sequence. For this model, we prove that this sampling method is successful with high probability. We also make experimental studies of the method on various real world networks.For t-vertex graphs G(t) generated by a preferential attachment process, we analyze a biassed random walk which makes transitions along undirected edges {x,y} proportional to [d(x)d(y)]b, where d(x) is the degree of vertex x and b &gt; 0 is a constant parameter. Let S(a) be the set of all vertices of degree at least ta in G(t). We show that for some b approx 2/3, if the biassed random walk starts at an arbitrary vertex of S(a), then with high probability the set S(a) can be discovered completely in ~O(t1-(4/3)a+d) steps, where d is a very small positive constant. The notation ~O ignores poly-log t factors.The preferential attachment process generates graphs with power law 3, so the above example is a special case of this result. For graphs with degree sequence power law c&gt;2 generated by a generalized preferential attachment process, a random walk with transitions along undirected edges {x,y} proportional to (d(x)d(y))(c-2)/2, discovers the set S(a) completely in ~O(t1-a(c-2)+d) steps with high probability. The cover time of the graph is ~O(t).Our results say that if we search preferential attachment graphs with a bias b=(c-2)/2 proportional to the power law c then, (i) we can find all high degree vertices quickly, and (ii) the time to discover all vertices is not much higher than in the case of a simple random walk. We conduct experimental tests on generated networks and real-world networks, which confirm these two properties.},

Based on the occurrence of references in users' libraries, we perform a large-scale impact factor analysis and an exploratory co-readership analysis. Our preliminary findings indicate that the analysis of user library statistics can produce accurate, timely, and content-rich results. We find that there is a significant relationship between the impact factor and the occurrence of references in libraries. Using a knowledge domain visualization based on co-occurrence measures, we are able to identify two areas of topics within the emerging field of technology-enhanced learning.},

abstract = {The foundation of almost all web sites' information architecture is a hierarchical content organization. Thus information architects put much effort in designing taxonomies that structure the content in a comprehensible and sound way. The taxonomies are obvious to human users from the site's system of main and sub menus. But current methods of web structure mining are not able to extract these central aspects of the information architecture. This is because they cannot interpret the visual encoding to recognize menus and their rank as humans do. In this paper we show that a web site's main navigation system can not only be distinguished by visual features but also by certain structural characteristics of the HTML tree and the web graph. We have developed a reliable and scalable solution that solves the problem of extracting menus for mining the information architecture. The novel MenuMiner-algorithm allows retrieving the original content organization of large-scale web sites. These data are very valuable for many applications, e.g. the presentation of search results. In an experiment we applied the method for finding site boundaries within a large domain. The evaluation showed that the method reliably delivers menus and site boundaries where other current approaches fail.},

abstract = {In the information explosion era, large scale data processing and mining is a hot issue. As microblog grows more popular, microblog services have become information provider on a web scale, so researches on microblog begin to focus more on its content mining than solely user's relationship analysis before. Although traditional text mining methods have been studied well, no algorithm is designed specially for microblog data, which contain structured information on social network besides plain text. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic generative model MicroBlog-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MB-LDA), which takes both contactor relevance relation and document relevance relation into consideration to improve topic mining in microblogs. Through Gibbs sampling for approximate inference of our model, MB-LDA can discover not only the topics of microblogs, but also the topics focused by contactors. When faced with large datasets, traditional techniques on single node become less practical within limited resources. So we present distributed MB-LDA in MapReduce framework in order to process large scale microblogs with high scalability. Furthermore, we apply a performance model to optimize the execution time by tuning the number of mappers and reducers. Experimental results on actual dataset show MB-LDA outperforms the baseline of LDA and distributed MB-LDA offers an effective solution to topic mining for large scale microblogs.},

Some of the most popular centrality measures (e.g. betweenness centrality, closeness centrality) are based on the calculation of shortest paths. This characteristic limits the applicability of these measures for larger networks. In this article we elaborate on the idea of bounded-distance shortest paths calculations. We claim criteria for k-centrality measures and we introduce one algorithm for calculating both betweenness and closeness based centralities. We also present normalizations for these measures. We show that k-centrality measures are good approximations for the corresponding centrality measures by achieving a tremendous gain of calculation time and also having linear calculation complexity O(n) for networks with constant average degree. This allows researchers to approximate centrality measures based on shortest paths for networks with millions of nodes or with high frequency in dynamically changing networks.},

In this paper we focus on the second aspect. For this, we propose to build an assistance tool based on users interaction traces. This tool will provide a contextualized assistance by leveraging the valuable knowledge contained in traces. We discuss the issue of assistance in our context and we show the different types of assistance that we intend to provide through three scenarios.

Linked data provides interconnection between this information, extending the scope of the knowledge production. The knowledge construction between decentralized sources in the web follows a co-evolution scheme, where knowledge is generated collaboratively and continuously. Sources are also autonomous, meaning that they can use and publish only the information they want. The updating of sources with this criteria is intimately related with the problem of synchronization, and the consistency between all the replicas managed. Recently, a new family of algorithms called Commutative Replicated Data Types have emerged for ensuring eventual consistency in highly dynamic environments.

abstract = {This paper addresses the concepts of community and online community and discusses the physical, functional, and symbolic characteristics of a community that have formed the basis for traditional definitions. It applies a four-dimensional perspective of space and place (i.e., shape, structure, context, and experience) as a framework for refining the definition of traditional offline communities and for developing a definition of online communities that can be effectively operationalized. The methods and quantitative measures of social network analysis are proposed as appropriate tools for investigating the nature and function of communities because they can be used to quantify the typically subjective social phenomena generally associated with communities.},

abstract = {In the real-time Web, the latest evolution of the Web, information (e.g., videos, images, and blogs) is generated very quickly, consumed by millions of users, and updated rapidly by others through commenting, replying, transferring, etc. This is practiced by people who differ in culture, knowledge, background, ideology. Moreover, information generally comes from several channels and is sent out to different ones. This is amplified by the social networking phenomenon - the social Web, which is nowadays a well established set of technologies, based on which users and service providers can exchange messages through an interaction network, share information and collaborate, advertise a product, create communities and influence them, etc. Besides, there is an abundant literature regarding the different aspects of social networks be it their construction or the detection of nodes playing specific roles. Thus, it is difficult to draw a clear image linking the existing models of social networks and the real underlying social mechanisms. As a result, there is a big gap in concertizing and evaluating most of the research efforts in this area. Furthermore, due to the growing complexity of digital social networks and the huge quantity of new data available every day, it becomes crucial for researchers to provide a clear understanding of the dynamics of these networks. It also becomes important for the community to not only understand what is happening currently in the network but also to predict the next evolution and monitor the trends in the network.To address the above mentioned aspects of social network dynamics, we solicited the following topics (but not limited to): Information diffusion in social networks, community extraction, analysis, and evolution, detection of (possibly evolving) roles, content evolution and tracking in social networks, social media recommendations, information quality and evolution in social content, evaluation techniques and benchmarks, new challenges in mining social networks, and example studies and use cases of dynamics of social networks. Such approaches can be applied to various areas including social sciences, politics, economics, marketing, tourism and culture. Among such areas, social networks are generating huge changes in the creation, distribution, and consumption of News creating opportunities for new applications and redefining business models. The workshop includes a special session on Social Media Applications in News, including papers specifically addressing these issues and positions from News business experts and practitioners.This year, the workshop has attracted 29 submissions. All submissions went through a rigorous review process with at least three reviews per paper. The selection was very hard since the submissions are of high quality and we have time constraints for presentations. To this end, 16 papers are accepted for oral presentations, and our workshop program consists of these 16 oral presentations and a keynote talk about the dynamics in social networks and the special session focusing on social networks usage for journalism.},

abstract = {We address the problem of visualizing structure of undirected graphs that have a value associated with each node into a K-dimensional Euclidean space in such a way that 1) the length of the point vector in this space is equal to the value assigned to the node and 2) nodes that are connected are placed as close as possible to each other in the space and nodes not connected are placed as far apart as possible from each other. The problem is reduced to K-dimensional spherical embedding with a proper objective function. The existing spherical embedding method can handle only a bipartite graph and cannot be used for this purpose. The other graph embedding methods, e.g., multi-dimensional scaling, spring force embedding methods, etc., cannot handle the value constraint and thus are not applicable, either. We propose a very efficient algorithm based on a power iteration that employs the double-centering operations. We apply the method to visualize the information diffusion process over a social network by assigning the node activation time to the node value, and compare the results with the other visualization methods. The results applied to four real world networks indicate that the proposed method can visualize the diffusion dynamics which the other methods cannot and the role of important nodes, e.g. mediator, more naturally than the other methods.},

abstract = {Today, online social networks have become powerful tools for the spread of information. They facilitate the rapid and large-scale propagation of content and the consequences of an information -- whether it is favorable or not to someone, false or true -- can then take considerable proportions. Therefore it is essential to provide means to analyze the phenomenon of information dissemination in such networks. Many recent studies have addressed the modeling of the process of information diffusion, from a topological point of view and in a theoretical perspective, but we still know little about the factors involved in it. With the assumption that the dynamics of the spreading process at the macroscopic level is explained by interactions at microscopic level between pairs of users and the topology of their interconnections, we propose a practical solution which aims to predict the temporal dynamics of diffusion in social networks. Our approach is based on machine learning techniques and the inference of time-dependent diffusion probabilities from a multidimensional analysis of individual behaviors. Experimental results on a real dataset extracted from Twitter show the interest and effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as interesting recommendations for future investigation.},

abstract = {In recent years, many companies have started to utilise online social communities as a means of communicating with and targeting their employees and customers. Such online communities include discussion fora which are driven by the conversational activity of users. For example, users may respond to certain ideas as a result of the influence of their neighbours in the underlying social network. We analyse such influence to target communities rather than individual actors because information is usually shared with the community and not just with individual users. In this paper, we study information diffusion across communities and argue that some communities are more suitable for maximising spread than others. In order to achieve this, we develop a set of novel measures for cross-community influence, and show that it outperforms other targeting strategies on 51 weeks of data of the largest Irish online discussion system, Boards.ie.},

abstract = {Twitter has redefined the way social activities can be coordinated; used for mobilizing people during natural disasters, studying health epidemics, and recently, as a communication platform during social and political change. As a large scale system, the volume of data transmitted per day presents Twitter users with a problem: how can valuable content be distilled from the back chatter, how can the providers of valuable information be promoted, and ultimately how can influential individuals be identified? To tackle this, we have developed a model based upon the Twitter message exchange which enables us to analyze conversations around specific topics and identify key players in a conversation. A working implementation of the model helps categorize Twitter users by specific roles based on their dynamic communication behavior rather than an analysis of their static friendship network. This provides a method of identifying users who are potentially producers or distributers of valuable knowledge.},

This result is interesting, because most diffusion models exhibit exponential behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new model of diffusion, based on the SI (Susceptible / Infected) model, which produces results close to the linear behavior of the observed diffusion. We then justify the linearity of this model, and we study its behavior in more details.},

Many algorithms have been proposed to automatically detect communities in static networks but few studies have considered the detection and tracking of communities in an evolving network. Tracking the evolution of a given community over time requires a clustering algorithm that produces stable clusters. However, most community detection algorithms are very unstable and therefore unusable for evolving networks. In this paper, we apply the methodology proposed in [seifi2012] to detect what we call community cores in evolving networks. We show that cores are much more stable than "classical" communities and that we can overcome the disadvantages of the stabilized methods.},

abstract = {"Electronic-sport" (E-Sport) is now established as a new entertainment genre. More and more players enjoy streaming their games, which attract even more viewers. In fact, in a recent social study, casual players were found to prefer watching professional gamers rather than playing the game themselves. Within this context, advertising provides a significant source of revenue to the professional players, the casters (displaying other people's games) and the game streaming platforms. For this paper, we crawled, during more than 100 days, the most popular among such specialized platforms: Twitch.tv. Thanks to these gigabytes of data, we propose a first characterization of a new Web community, and we show, among other results, that the number of viewers of a streaming session evolves in a predictable way, that audience peaks of a game are explainable and that a Condorcet method can be used to sensibly rank the streamers by popularity. Last but not least, we hope that this paper will bring to light the study of E-Sport and its growing community. They indeed deserve the attention of industrial partners (for the large amount of money involved) and researchers (for interesting problems in social network dynamics, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, etc.).},

This functions as follows: first we rank the list of unlinked nodes in a network at instant t according to different topological measures (nodes characteristics aggregation, nodes neighborhood based measures, distance based measures, etc). Each measure provides its own rank. Observing the network at instant t+1 where some new links appear, we weight each topological measure according to its performances in predicting these observed new links. These learned weights are then used in a modified version of classical computational social choice algorithms (such as Borda, Kemeny, etc) in order to have a model for predicting new links. We show the effectiveness of this approach through different experimentations applied to co-authorship networks extracted from the DBLP bibliographical database. Results we obtain, are also compared with the outcome of classical supervised machine learning based link prediction approaches applied to the same datasets.},

These assumptions are nonrealistic for many propagation processes extracted from Social Websites. We address the problem of predicting information propagation when the network diffusion structure is unknown and without making any closed world assumption. Instead of modeling a diffusion process, we propose to directly predict the final propagation state of the information over a whole user set. We describe a general model, able to learn predicting which users are the most likely to be contaminated by the information knowing an initial state of the network.

One possible explanation for this is that the incentive to socially propagate a deal is based on an individual threshold in LivingSocial, whereas in Groupon it is based on a collective threshold which is reached very early. Furthermore, the personal benefit of propagating a deal is greater in LivingSocial.},

On the one hand, the time series we obtain show that periodic events such as Christmas and Halloween evoke similar mood patterns every year. On the other hand, we see that a significant increase in negative mood indicators coincide with the announcement of the cuts to public spending by the government, and that this effect is still lasting. We also detect events such as the riots of summer 2011, as well as a possible calming effect coinciding with the run up to the royal wedding.},
