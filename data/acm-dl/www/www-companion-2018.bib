abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of an online study with the aim to shed light on the impact that semantic context cues have on the user acceptance of tag recommendations. Therefore, we conducted a work-integrated social bookmarking scenario with 17 university employees in order to compare the user acceptance of a context-aware tag recommendation algorithm called 3Layers with the user acceptance of a simple popularity-based baseline. In this scenario, we validated and verified the hypothesis that semantic context cues have a higher impact on the user acceptance of tag recommendations in a collaborative tagging setting than in an individual tagging setting. With this paper, we contribute to the sparse line of research presenting online recommendation studies.},

This algorithm explicitly captures the importance of a paper, its relevance to other papers, and the unequally distributed contribution of each citation. We validate TSCA by applying it on the citation data from American Physical Society (APS) in the scenario of identifying the Nobel prize winning papers of the Nobel laureates.

A classifier that predicts website abuses is finally built by using update histories from snapshots of known malicious websites before the detections. Evaluation results showed that the classifier could predict various website abuses, such as drive-by downloads, phishes, and defacements, with accuracy: a 76% true positive rate and a 26% false positive rate.},

Unlike previous work regarded social influence as regularization terms, we take advantage of network embedding techniques and propose an embedding based recommendation method. Specifically, we first pre-train a network embedding model on the users' social network to map each user into a low dimensional space, and then incorporate them into a matrix factorization model, which combines both latent and pre-learned features for recommendation. The experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed model is more effective and can reach better performance than other related methods.},

It is widely known that the performance of BPR depends largely on the quality of the negative sampler. In this short paper, we make two contributions with respect to BPR. First, we find that sampling negative items from the whole space is unnecessary and may even degrade the performance. Second, focusing on the purchase feedback of the E-commerce domain, we propose a simple yet effective sampler for BPR by leveraging the additional view data. Compared to the vanilla BPR that applies a uniform sampler on all candidates, our view-aware sampler enhances BPR with a relative improvement of 27.36% and 69.54% on two real-world datasets respectively.},

Connecting people to a new area of the network in a way that will cause them to become active in that area could help alleviate this effect and improve social welfare.Here we present preliminary analysis of network referrals, that is, attempts by users to connect peers to other areas of the network. We classify these referrals by their efficiency, i.e., the likelihood that a referral will result in a user becoming active in the new area of the network. We show that by using features describing past experience of the referring author and the content of their messages we are able to predict whether referral will be effective, reaching an AUC of 0.87 for those users most experienced in writing efficient referrals. Our results represent a first step towards algorithmically constructing efficient referrals with the goal of mitigating the "filter bubble" effect pervasive in on line social networks.},

However, there has not been much attempt to effectively utilise such tweets.

CYDES consists of two parts, namely feature matrix generation and algorithm classification. We combine three effective feature extraction methods with the idea of BOW model to construct a fixed-size feature matrix. After a nonlinear transformation to the feature matrix, a softmax regression model is utilized to generate a classification label representing the best community detection algorithm we select.

For frequent users, simply dividing the number of interactions with content (e.g., clicks) by the number of impressions (e.g., the number of times the content is presented to each user) would be a good estimate. However, such estimates are erroneous for users who have sparse interaction history, (e.g., new users). To alleviate the problem, feature-based approaches aim to learn functions predicting the affinity score using only none-click features, such as user demographics, locations, and interests. Likewise, such approaches do not take full advantage of the interaction history of frequent users. Motivated by the limitations of the two approaches, we propose a Gamma-Poisson model that aims at utilizing the interaction history of frequent users, as well as leveraging a feature-based model for infrequent users. Our intuition is that we should rely more on the interaction history when estimating affinity for frequent users, and weigh more on feature-based model for infrequent users. We present experimental results on large-scale real-world data in a publisher content clicks prediction task to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating user type affinity scores.},

abstract = {A valuable step towards news veracity assessment is to understand stance from different information sources, and the process is known as the stance detection. Specifically, the stance detection is to detect four kinds of stances ("agree'', "disagree'', "discuss'' and "unrelated'') of the news towards a claim. Existing methods tried to tackle the stance detection problem by classification-based algorithms. However, classification-based algorithms make a strong assumption that there is clear distinction between any two stances, which may not be held in the context of stance detection. Accordingly, we frame the detection problem as a ranking problem and propose a ranking-based method to improve detection performance. Compared with the classification-based methods, the ranking-based method compare the true stance and false stances and maximize the difference between them. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {A community detection (CD) method is usually evaluated by what extent it is able to discover the 'ground-truth' community structure of a network. A certain 'node-centric metadata' is used to define the ground-truth partition. However, nodes in real networks often have multiple metadata types (e.g., occupation, location); each can potentially form a ground-truth partition. Our experiment with 10 CD methods on 5 datasets (having multiple metadata-based ground-truth partitions) show that the metadata-based evaluation is misleading because there is no single CD method that can outperform others by detecting all types of metadata-based partitions. We further show that the community structure obtained from the CD methods is usually topologically stronger than any metadata-based partitions. Finally, we suggest a new task-based evaluation framework for CD methods and show that a certain type of CD methods is useful for a certain type of task.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, ride-sharing has been proven to be an effective way to relieve urban traffic congestion, as evidenced by several emerging ride-sharing platforms such as Uber and Didi. A key economic problem for these platforms is to design a revenue-optimal (or welfare-optimal) pricing scheme and a corresponding vehicle dispatching policy that incorporates geographic information, and more importantly, dynamic supply and demand. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem by introducing a unified model that takes into account both travel time and driver redirection. We tackle the non-convexity problem using the "ironing" technique and formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the states are the driver distributions and the decision variables are the prices. Our main finding is to give an efficient algorithm that computes the exact revenue (or welfare) optimal randomized pricing schemes. We characterize the optimal solutions of the MDP by primal-dual analysis of a convex program. We also conduct empirical analysis of our solution with real data of a major ride-sharing platform and show its significant advantages over fixed pricing schemes as well as those prevalent surge-based pricing schemes.},

abstract = {Extracting entities and their relations from text is an important task for understanding massive text corpora. Open information extraction (IE) systems mine relation tuples (i.e., entity arguments and a predicate string to describe their relation) from sentences. However, current open IE systems ignore the fact that global statistics in a large corpus can be collectively leveraged to identify high-quality sentence-level extractions. In this paper, we propose a novel open IE system, called ReMine, which integrates local context signal and global structural signal in a unified framework with distant supervision. The new system can be efficiently applied to different domains as it uses facts from external knowledge bases as supervision; and can effectively score sentence-level tuple extractions based on corpus-level statistics. Specifically, we design a joint optimization problem to unify (1) segmenting entity/relation phrases in individual sentences based on local context; and (2) measuring the quality of sentence-level extractions with a translating-based objective. Experiments on real-world corpora from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ReMine when compared to other open IE systems.},

Therefore, it is better to directly show timeout links to users for better experiences rather than making users excessively wait. In this paper, we present LinCa (Links Catcher), a novel approach that fully considers the Internet access restriction and reduces page loading time on client-side by parsing all HTTP requests, and intercepting all invalid links when a web navigation starts. Thus, we first create and maintain a Rule Base to store invalid links under given access restriction rules. We then update the Rule Base periodically to cover as many invalid links as possible and remove links that become valid. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of LinCa through experiments by building and deploying a Chrome extension. Experimental results show that LinCa can reduce page loading time with average 28.12% of original page loading time for our data sets.},

Furthermore, Flink requires little effort to process and clean the data without having to use different tools before analyzing the data. Tink focuses on interval graphs in which every edge is associated with a starting time and an ending time. The library provides facilities for temporal graph creation and maintenance, as well as standard temporal graph measures and algorithms.

To get around this problem, we propose a novel word vector training approach that leverages topically similar tweets to better learn the word associations.

abstract = {With a large number of stories emerging from the newsrooms, media websites need to curate interesting news for their readers. Although traditionally news was curated solely by human editors, increasing news volume has led media outlets to adopt editorial algorithms. However, such algorithms are often proprietary, and smaller outlets do not have the resources to build them from scratch. In this paper, we present a novel framework 'Samar' to automatically curate news by optimizing recency, relevance and diversity of the selected stories. Evaluations over two real-world news datasets show that Samar outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in matching the news curation performed by human editors.},

To ensure the trustworthiness of a public key server, transparent log systems such as CONIKS employ a tamper-evident data structure on the server and a gossiping protocol among clients in order to detect compromised servers. However, due to lack of incentive and vulnerability to malicious clients, a gossiping protocol is hard to implement in practice. Meanwhile, alternative solutions such as EthIKS are not scalable. This paper presents Trusternity, an auditing scheme relying on Ethereum blockchain that is easy to implement, scalable and inexpensive to operate.},

Moreover, the bidding on advertising inventory has few connections with propensity that can reach to cost-per-acquisition (CPA) goals. To address this problem, this paper presents a bid optimization scenario to achieve the desired CPA goals for advertisers. In particular, we build the optimization engine to make a decision by solving the constrained optimization problem. The proposed model can naturally recommend the bid that meets the advertisers' expectations by making inference over history auction behaviors. The bid optimization model outperforms the baseline methods on real-world campaigns, and can be applied into a wide range of scenarios for performance improvement and revenue liftup.},

abstract = {In online advertising, a common objective for advertisers is to get the maximum returns on investment given the budget. On one hand, if the bid is too high, the advertiser pays more money than he should pay for the same number of clicks. On the other hand, it the bid is too low, the advertiser cannot win in auctions and therefore it loses the opportunity. A challenging problem is how to recommend the bid to achieve the maximum values for advertisers. In this paper, we present an inflection point approach for bid recommendation from discovering the bid price of click(bid)1 function at which the function changes from significant increase (i.e. concave downward) to slow increase (convex upward). We derive the optimal solution using history sparse and noisy observations given the budget limit. In real word advertising campaign evaluations, the proposed bid recommendation scenario brings in 15.37% bid increase and 30.24% click increase over the baselines.},

Besides personal knowledge, network homophily has been identified as a driving factor for establishing contacts and followerships in social networks, i.e., people are more likely to engage with others if they are similar with respect to certain attributes. In this paper, we describe work in progress on investigating homophily at four academic conferences based on face-to-face (F2F) contact data collected using wearable sensors between conference participants. In particular, we study which personal attributes are predictive for face-to-face contacts. For that purpose, we obtained diverse personal attributes from online sources in order to elicit a variety of hypotheses, which can then be compared using descriptive statistics and a Bayesian method for comparing hypotheses in networks. Our results suggest that personal knowledge (as derived from DBLP and ResearchGate networks) and homophilic behavior with respect to several attributes, e.g., gender or country of origin, are important factors for contacts at academic conferences.},

Most current friend recommendations systems grow the existing network at the cost of privacy. In particular, any given user's friend graph may be directly or indirectly leaked as a result of such recommendations. In many situations this is not desirable, as the friend list may reveal much about the user--from their identity to their sexual orientation and interests. In this work, we focus on the "cold start" problem of making friend recommendations for new users while raising the bar on protecting the privacy of the friend list of all users. We propose a practical friend recommendation framework, tested on the Snapchat social network, that preserves the privacy of users' friends lists with respect to brute-force attacks and scales to millions of users.},

However, the objective function of the result diversification problem adopts the cascade assumption which assumes users' information needs will drop once their subtopic search intents are satisfied. As a result, the intent distribution of diversified results deviates from the actual distribution of user intentions, and each subtopic tends to be chosen equally. This phenomenon is unreasonable, especially when the original distribution of user intent is unbalanced. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of the diversification equilibrium by showing that the standard deviations of subtopic distribution approach zero.},

abstract = {The peer assessment approach is considered to be one of the best solutions for scaling both assessment and peer learning to global classrooms, such as MOOCs. However, some academic staff hesitate to use a peer assessment approach for their classes due to concerns about its credibility and reliability. The focus of our research is to detect the credibility level of each assessment performed by students during peer assessment. We found three major scopes in assessing the credibility level of evaluations, 1) Informativity, 2) Accuracy, and 3) Consistency. We collect assessments, including comments and grades provided by students during the peer assessment process and then each feedback-and-grade pair is labeled with its credibility level by Mechanical Turk evaluators. We extract relevant features from each labeled assessment and use them to build a classifier that attempts to automatically assess its level of credibility in C5.0 Decision Tree classifier. The evaluation results show that the model can be used to automatically classify peer assessments as credible or non-credible, with accuracy in the range of 88%.},

We had a comprehensive review procedure that looked at a number of dimensions including the novelty of the demo, its fit with the conference, its research content, and its potential for audience engagement. We were pleased by the number of submissions that included links to online demonstrations and/or videos. This gave reviewers additional information about how the demo would be presented. Overall, we had 232 reviews across all submissions. Many of the reviews provided not only a their expert judgement but ways in which the submissions could be improved. It is often difficult judging demonstrations as there are multiple factors to be taken into account. We want to thank the entire committee for taking the time to support the track. The resulting set of selected demos reflects the wide-variety of technology and research interests impacting the wide. Demonstrations cover topics such as using data on the web, the integration of the web and the physical world, knowledge graphs, search engines, security and privacy, and dealing with multimedia data. We believe that these demos provide an exciting taste of the future of the Web.},

abstract = {Nowadays, people get used to buying a variety of commodities from e-commerce platforms because of the convenience and easy access to Internet. As a result, the sales on e-commerce platforms have grown exponentially. It is promising to customize the online shops for different users under VR environments since users do not need to waste time of going upstairs or downstairs for finding interesting commodities. Therefore, in this demo paper, we propose a novel four-dimensional shopping mall that offers online group shopping services with the customized shop recommendation, where a group of friends in the proposed four-dimensional shopping mall can teleport to the next shop by one click. We formulate a Sequential group wIllingness OptimizatioN (SION) problem, prove SION is NP-hard, and provide an efficient algorithm called ζ-GSS. The experimental results show that the solution quality of the proposed ζ-GSS is close to the optimal solution, while the execution time only requires 3.3%. Finally, we build the prototype of the four-dimensional shopping mall, which can be demonstrated for users to experience the next-generation online shopping.},

In digital business, API economy is one of the key component for determining the value of provided services. With the rise in number of publicly available APIs, understanding each API endpoint manually is not only labor intensive but it is also an error prone task for software engineers. Due to the complexity of understanding the sheer number of APIs, it is difficult for software developers to find the best possible API combinations (i.e. API Mashups). In this demonstration, we introduce API Learning platform which employs machine-learning based technologies to efficiently search APIs, validate APIs, and generate API mashups. These technologies enable a machine to automatically generate machine-readable API specification from API documentations, understand variety of APIs, validate extracted information through automated API validation, and finally recommend API mashups for a specific purpose. As of now, API Learning platform collected over 14,000 API documentations and generates a machine readable format for REST APIs with an accuracy of 84%. The proposed demo prototype shows how it enables users to quickly find relevant APIs, automatically verify API availability, and get the best possible API mashup recommendations.},

It takes a natural language claim as input from the user and automatically analyzes its credibility by considering relevant articles from the Web. Our system captures joint interaction between language style of articles, their stance towards a claim and the trustworthiness of the sources. In addition, extraction of supporting evidence in the form of enriched snippets makes the verdicts of CredEye transparent and interpretable.},

SafeKeeper is a system for protecting web passwords against very strong adversaries, including sophisticated phishers and compromised servers. Compared to other approaches, one of the key differentiating aspects of SafeKeeper is that it provides web users with verifiable assurance that their passwords are being protected. In this paper, we demonstrate precisely how SafeKeeper can be used to protect web passwords in real-world systems. We first explain two important deployability aspects: i) how SafeKeeper can be integrated into the popular WordPress platform, and ii) how ordinary web users can use Intel SGX remote attestation to verify that SafeKeeper is running on a particular server. We then describe three demonstrations to illustrate the use of SafeKeeper: i) showing the user experience when visiting a legitimate website; ii) showing the encryption of the password in transit via live packet-capture; and iii) showing how SafeKeeper performs in the presence of phishing.},

When doing so, often, users have little or no clear knowledge about what service providers do with the trails of personal data they leave on the Internet. While regulations impose rather strict requirements that service providers should abide by, the defacto approach seems to be communicating data processing practices through privacy policies. However, privacy policies are long and complex for users to read and understand, thus failing their mere objective of informing users about the promised data processing behaviors of service providers. To address this pertinent issue, we propose a machine learning based approach to summarize the rather long privacy policy into short and condensed notes following a risk-based approach and using the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aspects as assessment criteria. The results are promising and indicate that our tool can summarize lengthy privacy policies in a short period of time, thus supporting users to take informed decisions regarding their information disclosure behaviors.},

It provides a multifaceted browsing platform that strives for an alternative, graph-based representation of artist connections to the grid-like conventions of traditional recommendation systems. Bipartite graph filtering of the Linked Data cloud, content-based music information retrieval, machine learning on crowd-sourced information and Semantic Web technologies are combined to analyze existing and create new categories of music artists through which they are connected. The categories can uncover similarities between artists who otherwise may not be immediately associated: for example, they may share ethnic background or nationality, common musical style or be signed to the same record label, come from the same geographic origin, share a fate or an affliction, or have made similar lifestyle choices. They may also prefer similar musical keys, instrumentation, rhythmic attributes, or even moods their music evokes. This demonstration is primarily meant to showcase the graph-based artist discovery interface of MusicLynx: how artists are connected through various categories, how the different graph filtering methods affect the topology and geometry of linked artists graphs, and ways in which users can connect to external services for additional content and information about objects of their interest.},

abstract = {The ANR project WASABI will last 42 months and consists in developing a 2 million songs database with interactive WebAudio enhanced client applications. Client applications target composers, music schools, sound engineering schools, musicologists, music streaming services and journalists. In this paper, we present a virtual pedal board (a set of chainable audio effects on the form of "pedals"), and a guitar tube amplifier simulation for guitarists, that will be associated with songs from the WASABI database. Music schools and music engineering schools are interested in such tools that can be run in a Web page, without the need to install any further software. Take a classic rock song: isolate the guitar solo, study it, then mute it and play guitar real-time along the other tracks using an online guitar amplifier that reproduces the real guitar amp model used in the song, with its signature sound, proper dynamic and frequency response. Add some audio effects such as a reverberation, a delay, a flanger, etc. in order to reproduce Pink Floyd's guitar sound or Eddie Van Halen famous "Brown Sound". Learn interactively, guitar in hands, how to fine tune a compressor effect, or how to shape the sound of a tube guitar amp, how to get a "modern metal" or a "Jimi Hendrix" sound, using only your Web browser.},

We have harvested a large corpus of query logs with different lineage and sizes, from DBPedia to BioPortal and Wikidata, whose total number of queries amounts to 180M. We ran a wide range of analyses on the corpus, spanning from simple tasks (keyword counts, triple counts, operator distributions), moderately deep tasks (projection test, query classification), and deep analysis (shape analysis, well-designedness, weakly well-designedness, hypertreewidth, and fractional edge cover). The key goal of our demonstration is to let the users dive into the SPARQL query logs of our corpus and let them discover the inherent characteristics of the queries. The entire corpus of SPARQL queries is stored in a DBMS. The tool has a GUI that allows users to ask sophisticated analytical queries on the SPARQL logs. These analytical queries can both be directly written in SQL or composed by a visual query builder tool. The results of the analytical queries are represented both textually (as SPARQL queries) and visually. The DBMS performs the searches within the corpus quite efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of this kind on such a large corpus and with such a number of varied tests.},

The platform further enables the interaction with the Crowd for filtering purposes or training data generation, and provides extended visualization and exploration capabilities. SmartPub will be demonstrated using sample collection of scientific publications focusing on the computer science domain and will address the entity types Dataset (i.e. dataset presented or used in a publication), and Methods (i.e. algorithms used to create/enrich/analyse a data set)},

More specifically, we develop a pipeline that helps identify energy-related content in Twitter posts and classify it into four categories (dwelling, food, leisure, and mobility), according to the type of activity performed. We further demonstrate a web-based application--called Social Smart Meter--that implements the proposed pipeline and enables different stakeholders to gain an insight into daily energy consumption behavior, as well as showcase it in case studies involving several world cities.},

At its core, MetaExp presents a small set of meta-paths to the user, which are sequences of relationships among node types. Such meta-paths do not overwhelm the user with complex structures, yet they preserve semantically-rich relationships in a graph. MetaExp engages the user in an interactive procedure, which involves simple meta-paths evaluations to infer a user-specific similarity measure. This similarity measure incorporates the domain knowledge and the preferences of the user, overcoming the fundamental limitations of previous methods based on local node neighborhoods or statically determined similarity scores. Our system provides a user-friendly interface for searching initial nodes and guides the user towards progressive refinements of the meta-paths. The system is demonstrated on three datasets, Freebase, a movie database, and a biological network.},

abstract = {The state-of-the-art techniques for aspect-level sentiment analysis focus on feature modeling using a variety of deep neural networks (DNN). Unfortunately, their practical performance may fall short of expectations due to semantic complexity of natural languages. Motivated by the observation that linguistic hints (e.g. explicit sentiment words and shift words) can be strong indicators of sentiment, we present a joint framework, SenHint, which integrates the output of deep neural networks and the implication of linguistic hints into a coherent reasoning model based on Markov Logic Network (MLN). In SenHint, linguistic hints are used in two ways: (1) to identify easy instances, whose sentiment can be automatically determined by machine with high accuracy; (2) to capture implicit relations between aspect polarities. We also empirically evaluate the performance of SenHint on both English and Chinese benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that SenHint can effectively improve accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art alternatives.},

Firstly, we generate tours for the interest set, by utilizing the available ranking of cities for the individual interests and the distances between the cities. Then, in absence of existing methods directly related to our problem, we devise our novel techniques to calculate ranking scores for the tours and present a comparison of these techniques in our results.

In addition, NELA allows users to visualize the media landscape at different time slices using a variety of features computed at the source level. NELA is built with a modular, pipeline design, to allow researchers to add new tools to the toolkit with ease.

abstract = {Although, over the years, information retrieval systems have shown tremendous improvements in searching for relevant scientific literature, human cognition is still required to search for specific document elements in full text publications. For instance, pseudocodes pertaining to algorithms published in scientific publications cannot be correctly matched against user queries, hence the process requires human involvement. AlgorithmSeer, a state-of-the-art technique, claims to replace humans in this task, but one of the limitations of such an algorithm search engine is that the metadata is simply a textual description of each pseudocode, without any algorithm-specific information. Hence, the search is performed merely by matching the user query to the textual metadata and ranking the results using conventional textual similarity techniques. The ability to automatically identify algorithm-specific metadata such as precision, recall, or f-measure would be useful when searching for algorithms. In this article, we propose a set of algorithms to extract further information pertaining to the performance of each algorithm. Specifically, sentences in an article that convey information about the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm are identified and extracted using a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN). Furthermore, we propose improving the efficacy of the pseudocode detection task by using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classification trained with 15 features, which improves the classification performance of the state-of-the-art pseudocode detection methods used in AlgorithmSeer by 27%. Finally, we show the advantages of the AI-enabled search engine (based on RCNN and MLP models) over conventional text-retrieval models.},

abstract = {Players are ranked in various sports to show their importance over other players. Existing methods only consider intra-type links (e.g., player to player and team to team), but ignore inter-type links (e.g., one type of player to another type of player, such as batsman to bowler and player to team) based on cognitive aspects. They also ignore the spatiality of the players. There is a strong relationship among players and their teams, which can be represented as a network consisting of multi-type interrelated objects. In this paper, we propose a players' ranking method, called Region-wise Players Link Fusion (RPLF) which is applied to the sport of cricket. RPLF considers players' region-wise intra-type and inter-type relation-based features to rank the players. Considering multi-type interrelated objects is based on the intuition that a batsman scoring high against top bowlers of a strong team or a bowler taking wickets against top batsmen of a strong team is considered as a good player. The experimental results show that RPLF provides promising insights of players' rankings. RLFP is a generic method and can be applied to different sports for ranking players.},

abstract = {Green spaces are believed to improve the well-being of users in urban areas. While there are urban research exploring the emotional benefits of green spaces, these works are based on user surveys and case studies, which are typically small in scale, intrusive, time-intensive and costly. In contrast to earlier works, we utilize a non-intrusive methodology to understand green space effects at large-scale and in greater detail, via digital traces left by Twitter users. Using this methodology, we perform an empirical study on the effects of green spaces on user sentiments and emotions in Melbourne, Australia and our main findings are: (i) tweets in green spaces evoke more positive and less negative emotions, compared to those in urban areas; (ii) each season affects various emotion types differently; (iii) there are interesting changes in sentiments based on the hour, day and month that a tweet was posted; and (iv) negative sentiments are typically associated with large transport infrastructures such as train interchanges, major road junctions and railway tracks. The novelty of our study is the combination of psychological theory, alongside data collection and analysis techniques on a large-scale Twitter dataset, which overcomes the limitations of traditional methods in urban research.},

abstract = {Microblog like Twitter and Sina Weibo has been an important information source for event detection and monitoring. In many decision-making scenarios, it is not enough to only provide a structural tuple for an event, e.g., a 5W1H record like <who, where, when, what, whom, how>. However, in addition to event structural tuples, people need to know the evolution lifecycle of an event. The lifecycle description of an event is more helpful for decision making because people can focus on the progress and trend of events. In this paper, we propose a novel method for efficiently detecting and tracking event evolution on microblogging platforms. The major features of our study are: (1) It provides a novel event-type-driven method to extract event tuples, which forms the foundation for event evolution analysis. (2) It describes the lifecycle of an event by a staged model, and provides effective algorithms for detecting the stages of an event. (3) It offers emotional analysis over the stages of an event, through which people are able to know the public emotional tendency over a specific event at different time periods. We build a prototype system and present its architecture and implemental details in the paper. In addition, we conduct experiments on real microblog datasets and the results in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.},

abstract = {Hurricane-induced flooding can lead to substantial loss of life and huge damage to infrastructure. Mapping flood extent from satellite or aerial imagery is essential for prioritizing relief efforts and for assessing future flood risk. Identification of water extent in such images can be challenging considering the heterogeneity in water body size and shape, cloud cover, and natural variations in land cover. In this effort, we introduce a novel cognitive framework based on a semi-supervised learning algorithm, called HUman-Guided Flood Mapping (HUG-FM), specifically designed to tackle the flood mapping problem. Our framework first divides the satellite or aerial image into patches leveraging a graph-based clustering approach. A domain expert is then asked to provide labels for a few patches (as opposed to pixels which are harder to discern). Subsequently, we learn a classifier based on the provided labels to map flood extent. We test the efficacy and efficiency of our framework on imagery from several recent flood-induced emergencies and results show that our algorithm can robustly and correctly detect water areas compared to the state-of-the-art. We then evaluate whether expert guidance can be replaced by the wisdom of a crowd (e.g., crisis volunteers). We design an online crowdsourcing platform based on HUG-FM and propose a novel ensemble method to leverage crowdsourcing efforts. We conduct an experiment with over $50$ participants and show that crowdsourced HUG-FM (CHUG-FM) can approach or even exceed the performance of a single expert providing guidance (HUG-FM).},

abstract = {The availability of open educational resources (OER) has enabled educators and researchers to access a variety of learning assessments online. OER communities are particularly useful for gathering multiple choice questions (MCQs), which are easy to grade, but difficult to design well. To account for this, OERs often rely on crowd-sourced data to validate the quality of MCQs. However, because crowds contain many non-experts, and are susceptible to question framing effects, they may produce ratings driven by guessing on the basis of surface-level linguistic features, rather than deep topic knowledge. Consumers of OER multiple choice questions (and authors of original multiple choice questions) would benefit from a tool that automatically provided feedback on assessment quality, and assessed the degree to which OER MCQs are susceptible to framing effects. This paper describes a model that is trained to use domain-naive strategies to guess which multiple choice answer is correct. The extent to which this model can predict the correct answer to an MCQ is an indicator that the MCQ is a poor measure of domain-specific knowledge. We describe an integration of this model with a front-end visualizer and MCQ authoring tool.},

abstract = {To establish an automatic conversation system between human and computer is regarded as one of the most hardcore problems in computer science. It requires interdisciplinary techniques of information retrieval, natural language processing, data management as well as artificial intelligence. The arrival of big data era reveals the feasibility to create a conversation system empowered by data-driven approaches. Now we are able to collect extremely large conversational data on Web, and organize them to launch a human-computer conversation system. Owing to the diversity of Web resources available, a retrieval-based conversation system will be able to find at least some responses from the massive data repository for any user inputs. Given a human issued utterance, i.e., a query, a retrieval-based conversation system will search for appropriate replies, conduct a relevance ranking, and then output the highly relevant one as the response. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval model named NeuRetrieval for short text understanding, representation and semantic matching. The proposed model is general and unified for both single-turn and multi-turn conversation scenarios in open domain. In the experiments, we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed deep neural network model for human-computer conversations. We demonstrate performance improvement against a series of baseline methods in several evaluation metrics. In contrast with previously proposed methods, NeuRetrieval is tailored for conversation scenarios and demonstrated to be more effective.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged recently and it becomes popular among people. During the process of the communication, different knowledge can be merged. Recently, several vendors use the business model of paying for knowledge to make these knowledge to the monetary benefits, then the Pay-for-Knowledge Communities (PKC) have been applied. Even PKC has interesting business model, there are several problems to be solved, and one of the most salient problem is that questioners may takes too long time to choose the most valuable answers, leading to questioners not able to pay for suitable answerers and many problems about platforms' operation There are several previous research has focused on this problem but still have not found satisfactory solutions as questions and answers are more and more complex in PKC platforms. With the development of cognitive computing techniques, applying an intelligent QA system in PKC to improve the answering effectiveness may be possible. In this paper, we tried to investigate how to apply the intelligent QA system into PKC platform to improve the answering effectiveness. For solving the problems of matching complex questions and answers, we present a Four Module QA Model based on the normal intelligent QA System. Compared to normal intelligent QA System, our model uses categories to classify the questions with traditional machine learning methods. We use answers in each category of corresponding questions as one dataset, answers in each entity of corresponding question as the other dataset, finally, these two datasets make up the document database. Then we got the best answer among past answers through comparing the TF-IDF weighted bag-of word vectors of two datasets or the new answer including key words through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm with PKC's features composed of centrality and money. Experiments were developed on a dataset with 1222 users' QA sites collected from a QA community. The model we proposed is expected to increase QA's effectiveness and improve the business model of Pay-for-Knowledge Communities.},

Therefore, it is expected that CC models provide solutions by examining a summary of past history, rather than using full historical data. This strategy has significant benefits in terms of response time and space complexity but poses new challenges in term of concept-drift detection, where both long term and short terms dynamics should be taken into account. In this paper, we introduce the Concept-Drift in Event Stream Framework (CDESF) that addresses some of these challenges for data streams recording the execution of a Web-based business process. Thanks to CDESF support for feature transformation, we perform density clustering in the transformed feature space of the process event stream, observe track concept-drift over time and identify anomalous cases in the form of outliers. We validate our approach using logs of an e-healthcare process.},

abstract = {Emojis can be regarded as a language for graphical expression of emotions, and have been widely used in social media. They can express more delicate feelings beyond textual information and improve the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication. Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to automatic compose text messages with emojis. However, the usages of emojis can be complicated and subtle so that analyzing and predicting emojis is a challenging problem. In this paper, we first construct a benchmark dataset of emojis with tweets and systematically investigate emoji usages in terms of tweet content, tweet structure and user demographics. Inspired by the investigation results, we further propose a multitask multimodality gated recurrent unit (mmGRU) model to predict the categories and positions of emojis. The model leverages not only multimodality information such as text, image and user demographics, but also the strong correlations between emoji categories and their positions. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy for predicting emojis for tweets (+9.0% in F1-value for category and +4.6% in F1-value for position). Based on the experimental results, we further conduct a series of case studies to unveil how emojis are used in social media.},

abstract = {Persuasiveness is a creative art which aims at inducing certain set of beliefs in the target audience. In an e-commerce setting, for a newly launched product, persuasive descriptions are often composed to motivate an online buyer towards a successful purchase. Such descriptions can be catchy taglines, product-summaries, style-tipsetc.. In this paper, we present PersuAIDE! - a persuasive system based on linguistic creativity to generate various forms of persuasive sentences from the input product specification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we have applied the technology to fashion domain, where, for a given fashion product like"red collar shirt" we were able to generate descriptive sentences that not only explain the item but also garner positive attention, making it persuasive. PersuAIDE! identifies fashion related keywords from input specifications and intelligently expands the keywords to creative phrases. Once such compatible phrases are obtained, persuasive descriptions are synthesized from the set of phrases and input keywords with the help of a neural language model trained on a large domain-specific fashion corpus. We evaluate the system on a large fashion corpus collected from different sources using (a) automatic text generation metrics used for Machine Translation and Automatic Summarization evaluation and Readability measurement, and (b) human judgment scores evaluating the persuasiveness and fluency of the generated text. Experimental results and qualitative analysis show that an unsupervised system like ours can produce more creative and better constructed persuasive output than supervised generative counterparts based on neural sequence-to-sequence models and statistical machine translation.},

abstract = {WeChat Business, developed on WeChat, the most extensively used instant messaging platform in China, is a new business model that bursts into people's lives in the e-commerce era. As one of the most typical WeChat Business behaviors, WeChat users can advertise products, advocate companies and share customer feedback to their WeChat friends by posting a WeChat Moment--a public status that contains images and a text. Given its popularity and significance, in this paper, we propose a novel Bilateral-Attention LSTM network (BiATT-LSTM) to identify WeChat Business Moments based on their texts and images. In particular, different from previous schemes that equally consider visual and textual modalities for a joint visual-textual classification task, we start our work with a text classification task based on an LSTM network, then we incorporate a bilateral-attention mechanism that can automatically learn two kinds of explicit attention weights for each word, namely 1) a global weight that is insensitive to the images in the same Moment with the word, and 2) a local weight that is sensitive to the images in the same Moment. In this process, we utilize visual information as a guidance to figure out the local weight of a word in a specific Moment. Two-level experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. It outperforms other schemes that jointly model visual and textual modalities. We also visualize the bilateral-attention mechanism to illustrate how this mechanism helps joint visual-textual classification.},

abstract = {This research article focuses on the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals of the brain during pain perception. The proposed system is based on the hypothesis that a noticeable change occurs in mental conditions while experiencing pain. When the human body is injured, sensory receptors in the brain enter a stimulated state. The injury may be the result of attention or an accident. Pain warnings are natural in humans and protect the body from further negative effects. In this article, an innovative and robust system based on prominent features extracted from the brain activity recorded using EEG, is proposed to predict the state of pain perception. The brain signals of subjects are observed using two low-cost EEG headsets including neurosky mindwave mobile and emotiv insight. Time and frequency domain features are selected to represent the observed signals. The results show that a combination of time and frequency domain features is the most informative approach for pain prediction using the observed brain activity.},

abstract = {Recommending proper experts to knowledge buyers is a significant problem in online paid Q&amp;A community (OPQC). Existing approaches for online expert recommendation have been mainly focused on exploiting semantic similarities and social network influence, while personalizing recommendation according to individuals' motivations has not received much attention. In this paper, we propose a personalized expert recommender system, which integrates buyer's motivation for knowledge, social influence, and money in a unified framework. As an innovative application of cognitive computing, our recommender system is capable of providing users with the best matching experts so as to help them make the most cost-effective choice in OPQC. To this end, Paragraph Vector technique is implemented to construct domain knowledge base (KB) in a multilayer information retrieval (IR) framework. Then we perform knowledge pricing based on buyer's query and bid in the context of bilateral monopoly knowledge market. After that, a Markov Chain based method with user motivation learning is introduced to find the best matching experts. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach using datasets collected from two OPQC. The experimental results show encouraging success as effectively offering reasonable personalization options. As an innovative approach to solve the expert matching problem in OPQC, this research provides flexibility in customizing the recommendation heuristics based on user motivation, and demonstrate its contribution to a higher rate of optimal knowledge seller-buyer matching.},

abstract = {With the increase in collaboration among researchers of various disciplines, changing the research topic or working on multiple topics is not an unusual behavior. Several comprehensive efforts have been made for predicting, quantifying, and studying the researcher's impact. The question, that how the change in the field of interest over time or working in more than one topics can influence the scientific impact, remains unanswered. In this research, we study the effect of topic drift on the scientific impact of an author. We apply Author Conference Topic (ACT) model to extract topic distribution of individual authors who are working on multiple topics to compare and analyze with authors who work on a single topic. We analyze the productivity of the authors on the basis of publication count, citation count and h-index. We find that authors who stick to one topic, produce a higher impact and gain more attention. To further strengthen our results we gather the h-index of top-ranked authors working on one topic and top-ranked authors working on multiple topics and examine whether there are similar trends in their progress. The results show an evidence of significant impact of topic drift on career choices of researchers.},

abstract = {Growth of multimodal content on the web and social media has generated abundant weakly aligned image-sentence pairs. However, it is hard to interpret them directly due to intrinsic intension. In this paper, we aim to annotate such image-sentence pairs with connotations as labels to capture the intrinsic intension. We achieve it with a connotation multimodal embedding model (CMEM) using a novel loss function. It's unique characteristics over previous models include: (i) the exploitation of multimodal data as opposed to only visual information, (ii) robustness to outlier labels in a multi-label scenario and (iii) works effectively with large-scale weakly supervised data. With extensive quantitative evaluation, we exhibit the effectiveness of CMEM for detection of multiple labels over other state-of-the-art approaches. Also, we show that in addition to annotation of image-sentence pairs with connotation labels, byproduct of our model inherently supports cross-modal retrieval i.e. image query - sentence retrieval.},

abstract = {Different urban regions usually have different commercial hotness due to the different social contexts inside. As satellite imagery promises high-resolution, low-cost, real-time, and ubiquitous data acquisition, this study aims to solve commercial hotness prediction as well as the correlated social contexts mining problem via visual pattern analysis on satellite images. The goal is to reveal the underlying law correlating visual patterns of satellite images with commercial hotness so as to infer the commercial hotness map of a whole city for government regulation and business planning. We propose a novel deep learning-based model, which learns semantic information from raw satellite images to enable predicting regional commercial hotness. First, we collect satellite images from Google Map and label such images with POI categories according to the annotations from OpenStreetMap. Then, we train a model of deep convolutional networks that leverage raw images to infer the social attributes of the region of interest. Finally, we use three classical regression methods to predict regional commercial hotness from the corresponding social contexts reflected in satellite images in Shanghai, where the applied deep features are learned from the examples of Beijing to guarantee the generality. The result shows that the proposed model is robust enough to reach 82% precision at average. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work focused on discovering relations between commercial hotness and satellite images. A web service is developed to demonstrate how business planning can be done in reference to the predicted commercial hotness of a given region.},

abstract = {Recently, deep neural network models have achieved promising results in image captioning task. Yet, "vanilla'' sentences, only describing shallow appearances (e.g., types, colors), generated by current works are not satisfied netizen style resulting in lacking engagements, contexts, and user intentions. To tackle this problem, we propose Netizen Style Commenting (NSC), to automatically generate characteristic comments to a user-contributed fashion photo. We are devoted to modulating the comments in a vivid "netizen'' style which reflects the culture in a designated social community and hopes to facilitate more engagement with users. In this work, we design a novel framework that consists of three major components: (1) We construct a large-scale clothing dataset named NetiLook, which contains 300K posts (photos) with 5M comments to discover netizen-style comments. (2) We propose three unique measures to estimate the diversity of comments. (3) We bring diversity by marrying topic models with neural networks to make up the insufficiency of conventional image captioning works. Experimenting over Flickr30k and our NetiLook datasets, we demonstrate our proposed approaches benefit fashion photo commenting and improve image captioning tasks both in accuracy and diversity.},

abstract = {Several prior studies have demonstrated the possibility of tracking the outbreak and spread of diseases using public tweets and other social media platforms. However, almost all such prior studies were restricted to geographically filtered English language tweets only. This study is the first to attempt a similar approach for Arabic language tweets originating from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. We obtained a list of commonly occurring diseases in the region from the Saudi Ministry of Health. We used both the English disease names as well as their Arabic translations to filter the stream of tweets. We acquired old tweets for a period spanning 29 months. All tweets were geographically filtered for the Middle East and the list of disease names in both English and Arabic languages. We observed that only a small fraction of tweets were in English, demonstrating that prior approaches to disease tracking relying on English language features are less effective for this region. We also demonstrate how Arabic language tweets can be used rather effectively to track the spread of some infectious diseases in the region. We verified our approach by demonstrating that a high degree of correlation between the occurrence of MERS-Coronavirus cases and Arabic language tweets on the disease. We also show that infectious diseases generating fewer tweets and non-infectious diseases do not exhibit the same high correlation. We also verify the usefulness of tracking cases using Twitter mentions by comparing against a ground truth data set of MERS-CoV cases obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health.},

A lack of standardization makes it difficult for other investigators to find relevant datasets and to perform secondary analyses. The Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) was founded with the goal of enhancing the authoring of experimental metadata to make online datasets more useful to the scientific community. CEDAR technology includes Web-based methods for creating and managing libraries of templates for representing metadata. CEDAR's templates interoperate with a repository of scientific ontologies to standardize the way in which the templates may be filled out. Collaborations with several major research projects are allowing us to explore how CEDAR may ease access to scientific data sets stored in public repositories.},

This first phase of the transition focuses on the development of the ability to produce metadata as LOD communally, the enhancement of the BIBFRAME ontology to encompass the multiple resource formats that academic libraries must process, and the engagement of the broader academic library community to ensure a sustainable and extensible environment. As its name implies, LD4P focuses on the immediate needs of metadata production such as ontology coverage and workflow transition. The LD4P partners' work will be based, in part, on a collection of tools that currently exist, such as those developed by the Library of Congress. The cyclical feedback of use and enhancement request to the developers of these tools will allow for their enhancement based on use in an actual production environment. The six institutions involved will focus on materials ranging from art to rare books, from cartographic materials to music, from annotations to workflows. Tool development and enhancement will also be a key aspect of the project. By the end of the first phase of this project (Spring 2018), the partners will have the minimal tooling, workflows, and standards developed to begin the transformation from MARC to LOD in Phase 2 of the project.},

abstract = {One of the most pressing and fascinating challenges scientists face today, is understanding the complexity of our globally interconnected society. The big data arising from the digital breadcrumbs of human activities has the potential of providing a powerful social microscope, which can help us understand many complex and hidden socio-economic phenomena. Such challenge requires high-level analytics, modeling and reasoning across all the social dimensions above. There is a need to harness these opportunities for scientific advancement and for the social good, compared to the currently prevalent exploitation of big data for commercial purposes or, worse, social control and surveillance. The main obstacle to this accomplishment, besides the scarcity of data scientists, is the lack of a large-scale open ecosystem where big data and social mining research can be carried out. The SoBigData Research Infrastructure (RI) provides an integrated ecosystem for ethic-sensitive scientific discoveries and advanced applications of social data mining on the various dimensions of social life as recorded by "big data". The research community uses the SoBigData facilities as a "secure digital wind-tunnel" for large-scale social data analysis and simulation experiments. SoBigData promotes repeatable and open science and supports data science research projects by providing: (i) an ever-growing, distributed data ecosystem for procurement, access and curation and management of big social data, to underpin social data mining research within an ethic-sensitive context; (ii) an ever-growing, distributed platform of interoperable, social data mining methods and associated skills: tools, methodologies and services for mining, analysing, and visualising complex and massive datasets, harnessing the techno-legal barriers to the ethically safe deployment of big data for social mining; (iii) an ecosystem where protection of personal information and the respect for fundamental human rights can coexist with a safe use of the same information for scientific purposes of broad and central societal interest. SoBigData has a dedicated ethical and legal board, which is implementing a legal and ethical framework.},

abstract = {The goal of AFEL is to develop, pilot and evaluate methods and applications, which advance informal/collective learning as it surfaces implicitly in online social environments. The project is following a multi-disciplinary, industry-driven approach to the analysis and understanding of learner data in order to personalize, accelerate and improve informal learning processes. Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining traditionally relate to the analysis and exploration of data coming from learning environments, especially to understand learners' behaviours. However, studies have for a long time demonstrated that learning activities happen outside of formal educational platforms, also. This includes informal and collective learning usually associated, as a side effect, with other (social) environments and activities. Relying on real data from a commercially available platform, the aim of AFEL is to provide and validate the technological grounding and tools for exploiting learning analytics on such learning activities. This will be achieved in relation to cognitive models of learning and collaboration, which are necessary to the understanding of loosely defined learning processes in online social environments. Applying the skills available in the consortium to a concrete set of live, industrial online social environments, AFEL will tackle the main challenges of informal learning analytics through 1) developing the tools and techniques necessary to capture information about learning activities from (not necessarily educational) online social environments; 2) creating methods for the analysis of such informal learning data, based on combining feature engineering and visual analytics with cognitive models of learning and collaboration; and 3) demonstrating the potential of the approach in improving the understanding of informal learning, and the way it is better supported; 4) evaluate all the former items in real world large scale applications and platforms.},

The goal is to give visibility of these results to a conference audience as well as to promote discussions concerning such results. The call for papers of the journal track was open for two categories of papers: 1) self-nominations from authors promoting their own journal publication(s) and matching the prerequisites reported above; 2) invited papers, selected on the basis of interest, appropriateness and attractiveness for the WWW 2018 audience, from articles published since January 1st 2015 (even only in the electronic version) in the following journals: Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Journal of Web Semantics, Semantic Web Journal, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, Journal of Machine Learning Research, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, ACM Transactions on the Web, ACM Computing Surveys, Knowledge-based systems, Artificial Intelligence. Exceptions have been also considered for papers judged as potentially very influential but published before January 2015 or in a journal not included in the list. We received 61 submissions and accepted 12 of them for presentation to the WWW 2018 Journal Track. The papers have been evaluated according to the following criteria: novelty, relevance to the conference, quality of the extended abstract, metrics values (e.g. number of citations) computed for the original journal paper, representativeness and impact factor of the journals in which the papers have been published (secondarily). We also took in account the coverage of the different areas related to WWW.},

abstract = {Graph aggregation is the process of computing a single output graph that constitutes a good compromise between several input graphs, each provided by a different source. One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders), when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given dataset (graphs as equivalence relations). Other potential applications include belief merging, data integration, and social network analysis. In this short paper, we review a recently introduced formal framework for graph aggregation that is grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. Our main result is a powerful impossibility theorem that generalises Arrow's seminal result regarding the aggregation of preference orders to a large collection of different types of graphs. We also provide a discussion of existing and potential applications of graph aggregation.},

abstract = {In this contribution we propose a hybrid recommendation framework based on classification algorithms such as Random Forests and Naive Bayes, which are fed with several heterogeneous groups of features. We split our features into two classes: classic features, as popularity-based, collaborative and content-based ones, and extended features gathered from the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, as basic ones (i.e. genre of a movie or the writer of a book) and graph-based features calculated on the ground of the different topological characteristics of the tripartite representation connecting users, items and properties in the LOD cloud. In the experimental session we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on varying of different groups of features, and results show that both LOD-based and graph-based features positively affect the overall performance of the algorithm, especially in highly sparse recommendation scenarios. Our approach also outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation techniques, thus confirming the insights behind this research.

To solve this issue, we introduce an approach to the preservation of knowledge graph, and we select the biodiversity domain to be our case studies because knowledge of this domain is commonly changed and all changes are clearly documented. Our work produces an ontology, transformation rules, and an application to demonstrate that it is feasible to present and preserve knowledge graphs and provides open and accurate access to linked data. It covers changes in names and their relationships from different time and communities as can be seen in the cases of taxonomic knowledge.},

abstract = {Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying network topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly creating new links when they are exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes---information diffusion and network evolution---have been typically studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics. In this work, we propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. The model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Moreover, we develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. Experiments in both synthetic data and real data gathered from Twitter show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.},

We introduce a mathematical formalism that captures the general notion of map of a graph and enables its development and manipulation in a semi-automated way. We describe an implementation of our formalism on the Web of Linked Data graph and discuss algorithms that efficiently generate and combine (via an algebra) regions and maps.

This survey categorizes existing assessment and ranking approaches into four framework types and discusses the main contributions and considerations of each type.

This result is particularly important in the era of big data, when data are typically large and scale-free, resulting in large degree variance. We derive the result by first giving the variances of random node and random edge estimators. A simpler and more intuitive result is obtained by assuming that the data is large and degree distribution follows a power law.},

abstract = {Our work considers leveraging crowd signals for detecting fake news and is motivated by tools recently introduced by Facebook that enable users to flag fake news. By aggregating users' flags, our goal is to select a small subset of news every day, send them to an expert (e.g., via a third-party fact-checking organization), and stop the spread of news identified as fake by an expert. The main objective of our work is to minimize the spread of misinformation by stopping the propagation of fake news in the network. It is especially challenging to achieve this objective as it requires detecting fake news with high-confidence as quickly as possible. We show that in order to leverage users' flags efficiently, it is crucial to learn about users' flagging accuracy. We develop a novel algorithm, DETECTIVE, that performs Bayesian inference for detecting fake news and jointly learns about users' flagging accuracy over time. Our algorithm employs posterior sampling to actively trade off exploitation (selecting news that maximize the objective value at a given epoch) and exploration (selecting news that maximize the value of information towards learning about users' flagging accuracy). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experiments and show the power of leveraging community signals for fake news detection.},

abstract = {With the support of major search platforms such as Google and Bing, fact-checking articles, which can be identified by their adoption of the schema.org ClaimReview structured markup, have gained widespread recognition for their role in the fight against digital misinformation. A claim-relevant document is an online document that addresses, and potentially expresses a stance towards, some claim. The claim-relevance discovery problem, then, is to find claim-relevant documents. Depending on the verdict from the fact check, claim-relevance discovery can help identify online misinformation. In this paper, we provide an initial approach to the claim-relevance discovery problem by leveraging various information retrieval and machine learning techniques. The system consists of three phases. First, we retrieve candidate documents based on various features in the fact-checking article. Second, we apply a relevance classifier to filter away documents that do not address the claim. Third, we apply a language feature based classifier to distinguish documents with different stances towards the claim. We experimentally demonstrate that our solution achieves solid results on a large-scale dataset and beats state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we highlight a rich set of case studies to demonstrate the myriad of remaining challenges and that this problem is far from being solved.},

abstract = {News entities must select and filter the coverage they broadcast through their respective channels since the set of world events is too large to be treated exhaustively. The subjective nature of this filtering induces biases due to, among other things, resource constraints, editorial guidelines, ideological affinities, or even the fragmented nature of the information at a journalist's disposal. The magnitude and direction of these biases are, however, widely unknown. The absence of ground truth, the sheer size of the event space, or the lack of an exhaustive set of absolute features to measure make it difficult to observe the bias directly, to characterize the leaning's nature and to factor it out to ensure a neutral coverage of the news. In this work, we introduce a methodology to capture the latent structure of media's decision process on a large scale. Our contribution is multi-fold. First, we show media coverage to be predictable using personalization techniques, and evaluate our approach on a large set of events collected from the GDELT database. We then show that a personalized and parametrized approach not only exhibits higher accuracy in coverage prediction, but also provides an interpretable representation of the selection bias. Last, we propose a method able to select a set of sources by leveraging the latent representation. These selected sources provide a more diverse and egalitarian coverage, all while retaining the most actively covered events.},

abstract = {This paper aims to shed light on alternative news media ecosystems that are believed to have influenced opinions and beliefs by false and/or biased news reporting during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. We examine a large, professionally curated list of 668 hyper-partisan websites and their corresponding Facebook pages, and identify key characteristics that mediate the traffic flow within this ecosystem. We uncover a pattern of new websites being established in the run up to the elections, and abandoned after. Such websites form an ecosystem, creating links from one website to another, and by 'liking' each others' Facebook pages. These practices are highly effective in directing user traffic internally within the ecosystem in a highly partisan manner, with right-leaning sites linking to and liking other right-leaning sites and similarly left-leaning sites linking to other sites on the left, thus forming a filter bubble amongst news producers similar to the filter bubble which has been widely observed among consumers of partisan news. Whereas there is activity along both left- and right-leaning sites, right-leaning sites are more evolved, accounting for a disproportionate number of abandoned websites and partisan internal links. We also examine demographic characteristics of consumers of hyper partisan news and find that some of the more populous demographic groups in the US tend to be consumers of more right-leaning sites.},

abstract = {The increasing number of news outlets and the frequency of the news cycle have made it all but impossible to obtain the full picture from online news. Consolidating news from different sources has thus become a necessity in online news processing. Despite the amount of research that has been devoted to different aspects of new event detection and tracking in news streams, solid solutions for such entangled streams of full news articles are still lacking. Many existing works focus on streams of microblogs since the analysis of news articles raises the additional problem of summarizing or extracting the relevant sections of articles. For the consolidation of identified news snippets, schemes along numerous different dimensions have been proposed, including publication time, temporal expressions, geo-spatial references, named entities, and topics. The granularity of aggregated news snippets then includes such diverse aspects as events, incidents, threads, or topics for various subdivisions of news articles. To support this variety of granularity levels, we propose a comprehensive network model for the representation of multiple entangled streams of news documents. Unlike previous methods, the model is geared towards entity-centric explorations and enables the consolidation of news along all dimensions, including the context of entity mentions. Since the model also serves as a reverse index, it supports explorations along the dimensions of sentences or documents for an encompassing view on news events. We evaluate the performance of our model on a large collection of entangled news streams from major news outlets of English speaking countries and a ground truth that we generate from event summaries in the Wikipedia Current Events portal.},

abstract = {Deceptive information in online news and social media has had dramatic effect on our society in recent years. This study is the first to gain deeper insights into writers' intent behind digital misinformation by analyzing psycholinguistic signals: moral foundations and connotations extracted from different types of deceptive news ranging from strategic disinformation to propaganda and hoaxes. To ensure consistency of our findings and generalizability across domains, we experiment with data from: (1) confirmed cases of disinformation in news summaries, (2) propaganda, hoax, and disinformation news pages, and (3) social media news. We first contrast lexical markers of biased language, syntactic and stylistic signals, and connotations across deceptive news types including disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes, and deceptive strategies including misleading or falsification. We then incorporate these insights to build machine learning and deep learning predictive models to infer deception strategies and deceptive news types. Our experimental results demonstrate that unlike earlier work on deception detection, content combined with biased language markers, moral foundations, and connotations leads to better predictive performance of deception strategies compared to syntactic and stylistic signals (as reported in earlier work on deceptive reviews). Falsification strategy is easier to identify than misleading strategy. Disinformation is more difficult to predict than to propaganda or hoaxes. Deceptive news types (disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes), unlike deceptive strategies (falsification and misleading), are more salient, and thus easier to identify in tweets than in news reports. Finally, our novel connotation analysis across deception types provides deeper understanding of writers' perspectives and therefore reveals the intentions behind digital misinformation.},

abstract = {In recent years, an unhealthy phenomenon characterized as the massive spread of fake news or unverified information (i.e., rumors) has become increasingly a daunting issue in human society. The rumors commonly originate from social media outlets, primarily microblogging platforms, being viral afterwards by the wild, willful propagation via a large number of participants. It is observed that rumorous posts often trigger versatile, mostly controversial stances among participating users. Thus, determining the stances on the posts in question can be pertinent to the successful detection of rumors, and vice versa. Existing studies, however, mainly regard rumor detection and stance classification as separate tasks. In this paper, we argue that they should be treated as a joint, collaborative effort, considering the strong connections between the veracity of claim and the stances expressed in responsive posts. Enlightened by the multi-task learning scheme, we propose a joint framework that unifies the two highly pertinent tasks, i.e., rumor detection and stance classification. Based on deep neural networks, we train both tasks jointly using weight sharing to extract the common and task-invariant features while each task can still learn its task-specific features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets gathered from Twitter and news portals demonstrate that our proposed framework improves both rumor detection and stance classification tasks consistently with the help of the strong inter-task connections, achieving much better performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

On a smaller scale, mainstream media have taken a closer look at the relatively narrow genre of satirical news content. Ed Koltonski of Kent State, defines satirical news as designed specifically to entertain the reader, usually with irony or wit, to critique society or a social figure and invoke change or reform. Using field experiment, survey and focus group methods we sought to determine if media consumers' ability to differentiate between satirical news and fake news is tied to socio-demographic factors. We found that age, education, sex, and political affiliation predict understanding of "fake news" and satire. Furthermore, the ability to identify different types of misinformation when presented with screen shots from social media posts appears to be related to these variables. Focus group comments were also analyzed to gain a richer perspective on how participants interpreted the SMS screen shots. Using our primary research, we seek to determine if there is a correlation between social media consumers understanding of the difference between satirical news versus fake news and their varying socio-demographic factors},

Next we analyze the content generated by those communities, and the extent to which these communities interact. Despite these elections being held in Germany, we note a substantial impact from the English-speaking Twittersphere.

The majority of customers, however, do not respond to rating surveys, which makes the result less representative. To understand overall satisfaction, this paper aims to investigate how likely customers without responses had satisfactory experiences compared to those respondents. To infer customer satisfaction of such unlabeled sessions, we propose models using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that learn continuous representations of unstructured text conversation. By analyzing online chat logs of over 170,000 sessions from Samsung's customer service department, we make a novel finding that while labeled sessions contributed by a small fraction of customers received overwhelmingly positive reviews, the majority of unlabeled sessions would have received lower ratings by customers. The data analytics presented in this paper not only have practical implications for helping detect dissatisfied customers on live chat services but also make theoretical contributions on discovering the level of biases in online rating platforms.},

Previous studies mostly deal with this task in either supervised or unsupervised manner according to whether label information is available. However, there always exists settings which are different from the two standard manners. In this paper, we address the scenario when anomalies are partially observed, i.e., we are given a large amount of unlabeled instances as well as a handful labeled anomalies. We refer to this problem as anomaly detection with partially observed anomalies, and proposed a two-stage method ADOA to solve it. Firstly, by addressing the difference between the anomalies, the observed anomalies are clustered, while the unlabeled instances are filtered to get potential anomalies and reliable normal instances. Then, with the above instances, a weight is attached to each instance according to the confidence of its label, and a weighted multi-class model is built, which will be further used to distinguish different anomalies to the normal instances. Experimental results show that in the aforementioned setting, existing methods behave unsatisfactorily and the proposed method performs significantly better than all these methods, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focused on revealing the relationship between visual patterns of satellite images as well as streetscapes and commercial activeness. We propose to make use of bag of features (BoF) in the context of computer vision and sparse representation in the sense of machine learning to predict commercial activeness of urban commercial districts. After obtaining the urban commercial districts via clustering, we predict the commercial activeness degrees of them using four image features, namely, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Autoencoder, GIST, and multifractal spectra for satellite images and street view images, respectively. The performance evaluation with four large-scale datasets demonstrates that the presented computational framework can not only predict the commercial activeness with satisfactory precision compared with that based on Point of Interest (POI) data but also discover the visual patterns related.},

abstract = {Mail extraction is a critical task whose objective is to extract valuable data from the content of mail messages. This task is key for many types of applications including re-targeting, mail search, and mail summarization, which utilize the important personal data pieces in mail messages to achieve their objectives. We focus on machine generated traffic, which comprises most of the Web mail traffic today, and use its structured and large-scale repetitive nature to devise a fully automated extraction method. Our solution builds on an advanced structural clustering technique previously presented by some of the authors of this work. The heart of our solution is an offline process that leverages the structural mail-specific characteristics of the clustering, and automatically creates extraction rules that are later applied online for each new arriving message. We provide of a full description of our process, which has been productized in Yahoo mail backend. We complete our work with large-scale experiments carried over real Yahoo mail traffic, and evaluate the performance of our automatic extraction method.},

abstract = {Although consumer behavior in response to search engine marketing has been studied extensively, few efforts have been made to understand how consumers search and respond to ads post purchase. Advertising to existing customers the same way as to prospective customers inevitably leads to wasteful and inefficient marketing. Employing a unique dataset that combines both search query and purchase data, we examine consumers' searching behavior and response to search engine marketing after purchase. We study large advertising campaigns for two popular technology products. We find that over half of the branded keyword searches come from consumers who already purchased the products, and that advertising response varies based on whether searchers are pre- or post-purchase. In general, post-purchase searchers are less likely to click on focal brand ads (i.e., they are less responsive to ads for products they already own). However, post-purchase searchers are still responsive to advertising and much more likely to click on ads for complementary products (i.e., they are more responsive to ads for relevant products other than the focal product).},

abstract = {Nowadays, billions of videos are online ready to be viewed and shared. Among an enormous volume of videos, some popular ones are widely viewed by online users while the majority attract little attention. Furthermore, within each video, different segments may attract significantly different numbers of views. This phenomenon leads to a challenging yet important problem, namely fine-grained video attractiveness prediction, which only relies on video contents to forecast video attractiveness at fine-grained levels, specifically video segments of several second length in this paper. However, one major obstacle for such a challenging problem is that no suitable benchmark dataset currently exists. To this end, we construct the first fine-grained video attractiveness dataset (FVAD), which is collected from one of the most popular video websites in the world. In total, the constructed FVAD consists of 1,019 drama episodes with 780.6 hours covering different categories and a wide variety of video contents. Apart from the large amount of videos, hundreds of millions of user behaviors during watching videos are also included, such as view counts, "fast-forward, "fast-rewind, and so on, where "view counts" reflects the video attractiveness while other engagements capture the interactions between the viewers and videos. First, we demonstrate that video attractiveness and different engagements present different relationships. Second, FVAD provides us an opportunity to study the fine-grained video attractiveness prediction problem. We design different sequential models to perform video attractiveness prediction by relying solely on video contents. The sequential models exploit the multimodal relationships between visual and audio components of the video contents at different levels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed sequential models with different visual and audio representations, the necessity of incorporating the two modalities, and the complementary behaviors of the sequential prediction models at different levels.},

abstract = {Tierless Web programming languages allow combining client-side and server-side programming in a single program. This allows defining expressions with both client and server parts, and at the same time provides good static guarantees regarding client-server communication. However, these nice properties come at a cost: most tierless languages offer very poor support for modularity and separate compilation. To regain this modularity and offer a larger-scale notion of composition, we propose to leverage a well-known tool: ML-style modules. In modern ML languages, the module system is a layer separate from the expression language. Eliom is an extension of OCaml for tierless Web programming which provides type-safe communication and an efficient execution model. In this article, we present how the Eliom module system combines the flexibility of tierless Web programming languages with a powerful module system, thus providing good support for abstraction, modularity and separate compilation. We also show that we can provide all these advantages while providing seamless integration with OCaml and its ecosystem.},

In this work, we extend Multiple Facets in three directions. First, we propose a new version of MF for arbitrary lattices, called Generalised Multiple Facets, or GMF. GMF strictly generalizes MF, which was originally proposed for a specific lattice of principals. Second, we propose a new optimization on top of GMF that further reduces the number of executions. Third, we strengthen the security guarantees provided by Multiple Facets by proposing a termination sensitive version that eliminates covert channels due to termination.},

Although developers have been actively using it since the first beta implementations in 2012, the number of web apps built using Web Audio API cannot yet compare to the number of commercial and open source audio software tools available on native platforms. Many of the sites using this new technology are of an experimental nature or are very limited in their scope. While JavaScript and Web standards are increasingly flexible and powerful, C and C++ are the languages most often used for real-time audio applications and domain specific languages such as FAUST facilitate rapid development with high performance. Our work aims to create a continuum between native and browser based audio app development and to appeal to programmers from both worlds. This paper presents our proposal including guidelines and proof of concept implementations for an open Web Audio plug-in standard - essentially the infrastructure to support high level audio plug-ins for the browser.},

Developers of liquid Web application need to control how to expose the liquid behavior of their cross-device Web applications to the users. To do so, they can use the API of Liquid.js we describe in this paper. Liquid.js is a framework for building component-based rich Web applications which run across multiple Web-enabled devices. The framework is based on technologies such as Polymer, WebRTC, WebWorkers, PouchDB and Yjs. Liquid.js helps to build decentralized Web applications whose components can seamlessly flow directly between Web browsers carrying along their execution state. The Liquid.js API gives developers fine-grained control over the liquid user experience primitives, device discovery, and the lifecycle of liquid Web components.},

abstract = {Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are a new class of Web applications, enabled for the most part by the Service Workers APIs. Service Workers allow apps to work offline by intercepting network requests to deliver programmatic or cached responses, Service Workers can receive push notifications and synchronize data in the background even when the app is not running, andtogether with Web App Manifestsallow users to install PWAs to their devices' home screens. Service Workers being a Web standard, support has landed in several stand-alone Android Web browsersamong them (but not limited to) Chrome and its open-source foundation Chromium, Firefox, Edge, Opera, UC Browser, Samsung Internet, andeagerly awaitediOS Safari. In this paper, we examine the PWA feature support situation in Web Views, that is, in-app Web experiences that are explicitly not stand-alone browsers. Such in-app browsers can commonly be encountered in chat applications like WeChat or WhatsApp, online social networks like Facebook or Twitter, but also email clients like Gmail, or simply anywhere where Web content is displayed inside native apps. We have developed an open-source application called PWA Feature Detector that allows for easily testing in-app browsers (and naturally stand-alone browsers), and have evaluated the level of support for PWA features on different devices and Web Views. On the one hand, our results show that there are big differences between the various Web View technologies and the browser engines they are based upon, but on the other hand, that for Android the results are independent from the devices' operating systems, which is good news given the problematic update policy of many device manufacturers. These findings help developers make educated choices when it comes to determining whether a PWA is the right approach given their target users' means of Web access.},

abstract = {The Web is based on numerous standards that together make up the surface of the Web: By knowing and supporting those standards, problems can be solved in well-known ways. This general design pattern on the Web applies to APIs in the very same way as it does to the human Web: By using an (evolving) set of standards, API developers benefit by not having to reinvent the wheel, and developers benefit by the same problem being solved in the same way across a variety of APIs. The evolving set of standards for Web APIs can be regarded as a set of building blocks or vocabularies for API design. Web Concepts is a site (webconcepts.info) and a repository (github.com/dret/webconcepts) that can be used to manage how within organizations these building blocks are used, thus helping to establish a Web API design culture. The main idea of Web Concepts is to promote reuse of existing standards and technologies, and to therefore make it easier for teams to understand which options are available generally speaking, and maybe which ones are popular choices within their organization.},

One of the main advantages of the Web of Data is that all of its content is processable by machines. However, this also has its drawbacks when it comes to monetization of the content: advertisements and donationstwo important financial motors in the World Wide Webdo not translate into the Web of Data as they rely on exposing the user to advertisement/call for donations. The remedy this situation, we propose two different monetization strategies for the Web of Data. The first strategy involves a marketplace where users can buy data in an integrated way. The second strategy allows third parties to promote certain data. In return, the sponsors pay money whenever a user follows a link contained in the sponsored data. We identified two different kind of datacommercial and sponsored datawhich can benefit from the two respective monetization strategies. With our work, we propose solutions to the problem of financing the creation and maintenance of content in the Web of Data.},

There is the possibility that other users illegally gain access to a users' account of social networks, web shops or other web services. Previous work use graph-based methods to identify hijacked or compromised accounts. Most often posts are used in social networks to detect fraudulences. However, not every compromised account is used to spread propaganda information or phishing attacks. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to the clickstreams from the accounts. In order to identify compromised accounts by means of clickstreams, we will also consider a temporal aspect, since the preferences of a user change over time. We choose a hybrid approach consisting of methods from subsymbolic and symbolic AI to detect fraudulences in clickstreams. We will also take into account the experience of domain experts. Our approach can also be used to identify not only compromised accounts but also shared accounts on instance streaming sites.},

abstract = {Web performance is important for the user experience and can heavily influence web page revenues. While there are many established Web Performance Optimization (WPO) methods, our work so far has clearly shown that new network protocols, optimized browsers and cutting-edge web standards can have a significant impact on known best practices. Additionally, there is still low-hanging fruit to be exploited, in the form of personalizing performance based on user context (i.e., current device, network, browser) and user preferences (e.g., text reading vs multimedia experience). In our PhD project, we strive to integrate this user-specific metadata into dynamic configurations for both existing and new automated WPO techniques. An intermediate server can (pre)generate optimized versions of a web page, which are then selected based on user context and preferences. Additional metadata is also passed along to the browser, enabling improvements on that side, and used to steer new network protocols to speed up the incremental delivery of page resources. We use the Speeder platform to perform and evaluate full-factorial objective measurements and use subjective user studies across a range of groups to assess the applicability of our methods to end users. Our aim is to provide insights in how WPO can be tweaked for specific users, in the hopes of leading to new web standards that enable this behavior.},

abstract = {Text contents are overloaded with the digitization of the data and new contents are transmitted through many sources by generating a large volume of information, which spreads all over the world through different communication media. Therefore, text data is available everywhere and reading, understanding and analysing the text data has become a main activity in daily routine. With the increment of the volume and the variety of information, organizing and searching, the required information has become vital. Topic modelling is the state of the art for information organization, understanding and extracting the content. Most of the prevailing topic models use the probabilistic approaches and consider the frequency and the co-occurrence to discover the topics from collections of documents. The proposed research aims to address the existing problems of topic modeling by introducing a concept embedded topic model which generates the most relevant and meaningful topics by understanding the content. The research includes approaches to understand the semantic elements from the content, domain identification of concepts and provide most suitable topics without getting the number of topics from the user beforehand. Capturing the semantics of document collections and generating the most related set of topics according to the actual meaning will be the significance of this research.},

Traditional methods employ stress measuring scales or physiological monitoring which may be intrusive and inconvenient. Instead, the ubiquitous nature of social media can be leveraged to identify stress and relaxation. In this PhD research, we introduce an improved method to detect expressions of stress and relaxation in social media content. It uses word sense vectors for word sense disambiguation to improve the performance of the first ever lexicon-based stress/relaxation detection algorithm TensiStrength. Experimental results show that TensiStrength with word sense disambiguation performs better than the original TensiStrength and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in terms of Pearson's correlation and accuracy. We also suggest a novel, word-vector based approach for detecting causes of stress and relaxation in social media content.},

To fill this gap, in this paper we propose CT-SPARQL and AIMRS, a language specifying for the compositional stream patterns and an architecture for adaptive incremental maintenance of RDF stream tuples defined in CT-SPARQL.

We aim to better understand what type of information supports people in finding and selecting data relevant for their respective tasks. We conducted a mixed-methods study looking at the workflow of data practitioners when searching for data. From that we identified textual summaries as a key element that supports the decision making process in information seeking activities for data. Based on these results we performed a mixed-methods study to identify attributes people consider important when summarising a dataset. We found text summaries are laid out according to common structures, contain four main information types, and cover a set of dataset features. We describe follow-up studies that are planned to validate these findings and to evaluate their applicability in a dataset search scenario.},

One can verify the maturity and correctness of a given ontology by evaluating how many competency questions give correct answers. Competency questions are defined as a set of questions expressed in natural language that the finished ontology should be able to answer to correctly. Although this method can easily indicate what is the development status of an ontology, one has to translate competency questions from natural language into an ontology query language. This task is very hard and time consuming. To overcome this problem, my PhD thesis focuses on methods for automatically checking answerability of competency questions for a given ontology and proposing SPARQL-OWL query (OWL-aware SPARQL query) for each question where it is possible to create the query. Because the task of automatic translation from competency questions to SPARQL-OWL queries is a novel one, besides a method, we have proposed a new benchmark to evaluate such translation.},

In biomedicine, using W3C-established standards and Linked Data principles, data publishers have transformed and linked several datasets to create a huge web of Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD). However, mining the LSLOD cloud is still very difficult and often impossible for biomedical researchers due to several challenges: structural heterogeneity, lack of vocabulary reuse, inconsistencies, and incompleteness. To discover drug-adverse reaction associations and their mechanistic explanations, I have developed a novel architecture that combines information retrieval and association discovery. The architecture demonstrates favorable AUROC statistics against baseline methods in pharmacovigilance, and provides confidence values on underlying biological mechanisms. I quantify the several challenges associated with mining the LSLOD cloud for biomedical applications through an empirical analysis of more than 40 different sources. Ideally, the architecture can be extended in other domains to realize the goal of implicit association discovery.},

abstract = {Contemporary social media networks can be viewed as a break to the early two-step flow model in which influential individuals act as intermediaries between the media and the public for information diffusion. Today's social media platforms enable users to both generate and consume online contents. Users continuously engage and disengage in discussions with varying degrees of interaction leading to formation of distinct online communities. Such communities are often formed at high-level either based on metadata, such as hashtags on Twitter, or popular content triggered by few influential users. These online communities often do not reflect true connectivity and lack the cohesiveness of traditional communities. In this study, we investigate real-time formation of temporal communities on Twitter. We aim at defining both high and low levels connections and to reveal the magnitude of clustering cohesion on temporal basis. Inspired by a real-life event center sitting arrangement scenario, the proposed method aims to cluster users into distinct and cohesive online temporal communities. Membership to a community relies on intrinsic tweet properties to define similarity as the basis for interaction networks. The proposed method can be useful for local event monitoring and clique-based marketing among other applications.},

abstract = {Social networks have been a popular choice of study, given the surge of online data on friendship networks, communication networks, collaboration networks etc. This popularity, however, is not true for all types of social networks. In the current work, we draw the reader's attention to a class of social networks which are investigated to a limited extent, classified as distributed sensitive social networks. It constitutes of networks where the presence or absence of edges in the network is distributedly known to a set of parties, who regard this information as their private data. Supply chain networks, informal networks such as trust network, advice network, enmity network, etc. are a few examples of the same. A major reason for the lack of any substantial study on these networks has been the unavailability of data. As a solution, we propose a privacy preserving approach to investigating these networks. We show the feasibility of using secure multiparty computation techniques to perform the required analysis, while preserving the privacy of every individual's data. The possible approaches that can be considered to ensure the design of efficient secure protocols are discussed such as efficient circuit design, ORAM based secure computation, use of oblivious data structures, etc. The results obtained in the direction of secure network analysis algorithms are also presented.},

More specifically, the number of mobile internet users has surpassed the desktop users according to different statistics; a considerable portion of web use cases are in the form of social interactions rather than information seeking; and the authoring behaviour has transformed from compiling a page and linking resources to sharing content with like-minded followers and leaving likes and comments on posts. Those changes have influenced and are expected to shape the way the content is organized, searched, ranked and analyzed. This panel brings together researchers who have been working in different established areas related to web search and mining, web content and social network analysis, and semantics and knowledge management. The panel will draw from the experience of the panellists, dealing with changes in their respective fields. In the first (role-playing) round, each panellist will strongly take a side on where the changes are heading, arguing that one form of content will dominate in the near future. In the second round, the panellists will counter each other and will share their vision on what future holds in terms of research problems and directions.

Not surprisingly, many large and small tech companies are rushing to occupy this space by providing platforms for building cognitive services and conversational bots. Digital assistants interact in a natural way (through text or voice) with both software and humans to get information and perform actions, from checking the weather to booking a restaurants and a cab ride, managing cloud resources, answering simple scientific questions, and preparing a decaf latte using IoT enabled coffee machines. User requests or tasks are often expressed in natural language, an interaction ensues to clarify the intent and the details, and the answer is sought - or the appropriate service or device is invoked - based on the cognitive service understanding. While the potential of this new wave of services is exciting, it also brings significant challenges: we are far away from the comfort of developing deterministic software that responds to API calls by invoking other APIs. Now we have to understand, guess, explore options, take decisions based on probabilistic models over a large set of possible intents and services, all while engaging with users. Doing so brings a large set of engineering challenges related to the development, training, tuning and evolution of such services. This panel will discuss such challenges and identify interesting opportunities for research as well as promising trends.},

This year, the proposed workshop will emphasize on the contribution of web applications and Apps to citizen centricity. In the era of cities, municipal leaders, service and utility providers are making an important shift regarding thinking of people as customers and of customer experience. This shift is not a simple task since it demands a continuous service monitoring, assessment and improvement [1;2;3], which normally is based on accurate data analysis and appears as a thinking that makes government and providers more personal and responsive.},

These platforms integrate data collected from devices and citizen-generated data and thereafter employ big data analytics to create insights from the data. These platform enable the creation of context-aware Intelligent traffic management systems (ITMS), however the involvement of various actors at different stages hampers development. In this paper, we propose a framework to support sustainable traffic management system for providing better commute, safety and security during travel based on real-time information. The framework should help to integrate the activities performed by the various actors. The main key elements of this framework are Datasets, Traffic Management Analytics, Actors and Actions which are taken by these users. The framework helps to create an overall overview of the activities needed. In this way it can be used to improve the quality of the traffic flow, increase efficient use of resources, smooth and safe commute of the citizens.},

This notwithstanding, there is still a long way to go to put the power of data in the hands of citizens. This article suggests that transparency in the context of open government can be increased through web maps featuring: i) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which support app and data usage tracking; and (ii) 'transparency badges' which inform the users about the presence/absence of extra, useful contextual information. Eight examples of web maps are introduced as proof of concept for the idea. Designing and implementing these web maps has reminded of the need of interactive guidelines to help non-experts select vocabularies, and datasets to link to. The ideas presented are relevant to making existing open data more user friendly (and ultimately more usable).},

In this paper, we first present our findings on behavioral preferences and key concerns of citizens regarding smart-city services via an opinion survey conducted with 1300 participants. We then propose a "citizen-controlled" urban services reporting platform where citizens actively report on the status of various municipal resources. We advocate the importance of matching user mobility patterns against task locations to make the platform more efficient (i.e., higher task completion rate and lower detour overhead).},

Different from the feature engineering process in conventional analysis, network representation learning, also know as network embedding, aims to learn the latent low-dimensional representations for objects in networks, such as nodes, links, and groups. Its ultimate objective is to encode networks' structural properties into the latent representations, benefiting all existing network mining tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, community detection, etc. In the BigNet 2018 workshop, we aim to provide a forum for presenting the most recent advances in network representation learning to unearth rich knowledge.},

abstract = {Recently there have been a large number of studies on embedding large-scale information networks using low-dimensional, neighborhood and community aware node representations. Though the performance of these embedding models have been better than traditional methods for graph mining applications, little is known about what these representations encode, or why a particular node representation works better for certain tasks. Our work presented here constitutes the first step in decoding the black-box of vector embeddings of nodes by evaluating their effectiveness in encoding elementary properties of a node such as page rank, degree, closeness centrality, clustering coefficient, etc. We believe that a node representation is effective for an application only if it encodes the application-specific elementary properties of nodes. To unpack the elementary properties encoded in a node representation, we evaluate the representations on the accuracy with which they can model each of these properties. Our extensive study of three state-of-the-art node representation models (DeepWalk, node2vec and LINE) on four different tasks and six diverse graphs reveal that node2vec and LINE best encode the network properties of sparse and dense graphs respectively. We correlate the model performance obtained for elementary property prediction tasks with the high-level downstream applications such as link prediction and node classification, and visualize the task performance vector of each model to understand the semantic similarity between the embeddings learned by various models. Our first study of the node embedding models for outlier detection reveals that node2vec and DeepWalk identify outliers well for sparse and dense graphs respectively. Our analysis highlights that the proposed elementary property prediction tasks help in unearthing the important features responsible for the given node embedding model to perform well for a given downstream task. This understanding would facilitate in picking the right model for a given downstream task.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general inductive graph representation learning framework called DeepGL for learning deep node and edge features that generalize across-networks. In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features from the graph (e.g., graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work, DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that naturally generalize across-networks and are therefore useful for graph-based transfer learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns interpretable inductive graph representations, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable components, efficient with a time complexity of O(|E|), and scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared with recent methods, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and large (attributed) graphs, (2) space-efficient requiring up to 6x less memory, (3) fast with up to 182x speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement in AUC of 20% or more on many learning tasks and across a wide variety of networks.},

abstract = {Networks are fundamental models for data used in practically every application domain. In most instances, several implicit or explicit choices about the network definition impact the translation of underlying data to a network representation, and the subsequent question(s) about the underlying system being represented. Users of downstream network data may not even be aware of these choices or their impacts. We propose a task-focused network model selection methodology which addresses several key challenges. Our approach constructs network models from underlying data and uses minimum description length (MDL) criteria for selection. Our methodology measures efficiency, a general and comparable measure of the network's performance of a local (i.e. node-level) predictive task of interest. Selection on efficiency favors parsimonious (e.g. sparse) models to avoid overfitting and can be applied across arbitrary tasks and representations. We show stability, sensitivity, and significance testing in our methodology.},

In this work, we describe a general framework for incorporating temporal information into network embedding methods. The framework gives rise to methods for learning time-respecting embeddings from continuous-time dynamic networks. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and dynamic network embedding approach as it achieves an average gain of 11.9% across all methods and graphs.

abstract = {Vector embedding models have recently become popular for encoding both structured and unstructured data. In the context of knowledge graphs such models often serve as additional evidence supporting various tasks related to the knowledge base population: e.g., information extraction or link prediction to expand the original dataset. However, the embedding models themselves are often not used directly alongside structured data: they merely serve as additional evidence for structured knowledge extraction. In the metaphactory knowledge graph management platform, we use federated hybrid SPARQL queries for combining explicit information stated in the graph, implicit information from the associated embedding models, and information extracted using vector embeddings in a transparent way for the end user. In this paper we show how we integrated RDF data with vector space models to construct an augmented knowledge graph to be used in customer applications.},

abstract = {Widespread adoption of networking technologies has brought about tremendous economic and social growth, but also exposed individuals and organization to new threats from malicious cyber actors. Recent attacks by WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware crypto-worms, infected hundreds of thousands of computer systems world wide, compromising data and critical infrastructure. In order to limit their impact, it is, therefore, critical to detect---and even predict---cyber attacks before they spread. Here, we introduce DISCOVER, an early cyber threat warning system, that mines online chatter from cyber actors on social media, security blogs, and darkweb forums, to identify words that signal potential cyber attacks. We evaluate DISCOVER and find that it can identify terms related to emerging cyber threats with precision above $80%$. DISCOVER also generates a time line of related online discussions on different Web sources that can be useful for analyzing emerging cyber threats.},

abstract = {We set out to understand the effects of differing language on the ability of cybercriminals to navigate webmail accounts and locate sensitive information in them. To this end, we configured thirty Gmail honeypot accounts with English, Romanian, and Greek language settings. We populated the accounts with email messages in those languages by subscribing them to selected online newsletters. We also hid email messages about fake bank accounts in fifteen of the accounts to mimic real-world webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey accounts via paste sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, and collected data for fifteen days. Our statistical analyses on the data show that cybercriminals are more likely to discover sensitive information (bank account information) in the Greek accounts than the remaining accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek visitors to the Greek accounts. We also extracted the important words among the emails that cybercriminals accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they possibly searched for within the honey accounts), and found that financial terms featured among the top words. In summary, we show that language plays a significant role in the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive information hidden in compromised webmail accounts.},

In this work, we perform a preliminary linguistic study on messages exchanged using one such popular web/smartphone application---Sarahah, that allows friends to exchange messages anonymously. Since messages exchanged via Sarahah are private, we collect them when the recipient shares it on Twitter. We then perform an analysis of the different kinds of messages exchanged through this application. Our linguistic analysis reveals that a significant number of these messages (~20%) include inappropriate, hurtful, or profane language intended to embarrass, offend, or bully the recipient. Our analysis helps in understanding the different ways in which anonymous message exchange platforms are used and the different types of bullying present in such exchanges.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, a number of new "fringe" communities, like 4chan or certain subreddits, have gained traction on the Web at a rapid pace. However, more often than not, little is known about how they evolve or what kind of activities they attract, despite recent research has shown that they influence how false information reaches mainstream communities. This motivates the need to monitor these communities and analyze their impact on the Web's information ecosystem. In August 2016, a new social network called Gab was created as an alternative to Twitter. It positions itself as putting "people and free speech first", welcoming users banned or suspended from other social networks. In this paper, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first characterization of Gab. We collect and analyze 22M posts produced by 336K users between August 2016 and January 2018, finding that Gab is predominantly used for the dissemination and discussion of news and world events, and that it attracts alt-right users, conspiracy theorists, and other trolls. We also measure the prevalence of hate speech on the platform, finding it to be much higher than Twitter, but lower than 4chan's Politically Incorrect board.},

abstract = {Welcome to the 3rd Educational Knowledge Management (EKM) workshop, which takes place at the WWW18 conference, in Lyon, France. The first edition was in 2014 in conjunction with the International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW), which was held in Link\"{o}ping, Sweden, and the second one with EKAW 2016, in Bologna, Italy. We received 6 papers from all around the world covering a broad range of topics. Each paper was reviewed by three members of the program committee. After the reviewing process, three papers were accepted for inclusion into the WWW proceedings volume, two of them as full papers and one as a short paper. The EKM2018 workshop will run as a half-day event, including the papers' presentation and two invited speaker sessions. A Best Paper Award will be assigned, and authors will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue that will be published as part of the "International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Lifelong Learning." The first paper Construction and Applications of TeKnowbase A Knowledge Base of Computer Science concepts' by Rajna Upadhyay, Ashutosh Bindal, Manjeet Kumar, and Maya Ramanath describes the development and evaluation of TeKnowbase, and how to use it in a variety of applications for learning a new topic, classification of technical text and querying and ranking computer science articles. The second one untitled "Ontology-based recommender system in higher education" by Charbel Obeid, Inaya Lahoud, Hicham El Khoury, and Pierre-Antoine Champin, is a position paper discussing an ontology-based recommender system to support a student's choice of major and university. The third paper "Automatic Generation of Quizzes from DBpedia According to Educational Standards" by Oscar Rodr\'{\i}guez Rocha and Catherine Faron Zucker focuses on educational quizzes. The authors present an approach to generate quizzes automatically from existing knowledge bases available on the Web of Linked Open Data (LOD), according to the official French educational standards.},

abstract = {Academic advising is limited in its ability to assist students in identifying academic pathways. Selecting a major and a university is a challenging process rife with anxiety. Students at high school are not sure how to match their interests with their working future or major. Therefore, high school students need guidance and support. Moreover, students need to filter, prioritize and efficiently get appropriate information from the web in order to solve the problem of information overload. This paper represents an approach for developing ontology-based recommender system improved with machine learning techniques to orient students in higher education. The proposed recommender system is an assessment tool for students' vocational strengths and weaknesses, interests and capabilities. The main objective of our ontology-based recommender system is to identify the student requirements, interests, preferences and capabilities to recommend the appropriate major and university for each one.},

On the one hand side, implementing Question Answering Systems is still hard and time-consuming, on the other hand side, the QA community is still struggling on defining a common ground for collaboration across research fields regarding, for example, realistic benchmarks, maintainability, and broad coverage of knowledge sources. In the talk, challenges of Question Answering will be highlight w.r.t. hybrid QA, domain-specific QA, cross knowledge base QA, etc. Particularly the industry perspective is also presented while aiming at a Question Answering platform which can be assembled from industry components as well as components of the research community. First steps towards this long-term vision are provided by the Qanary framework and similar frameworks aiming at a collaborative approach for the development QA systems which should lead to effective implementations, improved research results as well as a platform economy for QA. Such a platform would industry lead to a tighter collaboration while academics would have the opportunity of accessing precious data for further improvements.},

While complexity has several facets, question dimensions like temporal and spatial intents necessitate specialized treatment. Methods geared towards such questions need benchmarks that reflect the desired aspects and challenges. Here, we take a key step in this direction, and release a new benchmark, TempQuestions, containing 1,271 questions, that are all temporal in nature, paired with their answers. As a key contribution that enabled the creation of this resource, we provide a crisp definition for temporal questions. Most questions require decomposing them into sub-questions, and the questions are of a kind that they would be best evaluated on a combination of structured data and unstructured text sources. Experiments with two QA systems demonstrate the need for further research on complex questions.},

With the growth in Question Answering systems and mobile communications, FAQ retrieval systems have become widely used in site searches and call center support. However, FAQ retrieval often has lexical gaps between queries and answer documents. To bridge these gaps, we design a query expansion model on the basis of an Encoder-Decoder model as a type of deep neural network. The model learns the words that appear in answers for questions using Q&amp;A pair documents and generates the expanded queries from inputted queries to retrieve answer documents. We evaluate our proposed technique in a multi-domain FAQ retrieval task. Experimental results show that our technique retrieves FAQs more accurately than the previous methods.},

abstract = {Finding suitable candidates for clinical trials is a labor-intensive task that requires expert medical knowledge. Our goal is to design (semi-)automated techniques that can support clinical researchers in this task. We investigate the issues involved in designing formal query languages for selecting patients that are eligible for a given clinical trial, leveraging existing ontology-based query answering techniques. In particular, we propose to use a temporal extension of existing approaches for accessing data through ontologies written in Description Logics. We sketch how such a query answering system could work and show that eligibility criteria and patient data can be adequately modeled in our formalism.},

abstract = {QA systems offer a human friendly interface to navigate through knowledge, which can range from encyclopedic to domain-specific. Generally, a QA system is designed to provide an answer to a specific question once (so-called single turn) and state-of-the-art systems reach nowadays robust performance in such a scenario. However, most of the interactions with QA systems are based on multiple handshakes of question/answer pairs, where the human being refines the questions further, while the system can collect the necessary information and generate a compelling final answer through multiple turns. In this paper, we investigate and experiment a multi-turn QA system that is suited to work given a particular domain of knowledge and configurable goals. Our approach models the entire dialogue as a sequence of turns, i.e. questions and answers, using a Recurrent Neural Network which is firstly trained to understand natural language, classifying entities and intents using prior knowledge of domain-specific interactions, and provide answers according to the domain used as background knowledge. We have compared our approach with state-of-the-art sequence-based intent classification using a well-known and standardized gold standard observing an increase of 17.16% of F1. Results show the robustness of the approach and the competitive results motivate the adoption in multi-turn QA scenarios.},

abstract = {Question answering has been the focus of a lot of researches and evaluation campaigns, either for text-based systems (TREC and CLEF evaluation campaigns for example), or for knowledge-based systems (QALD, BioASQ). Few systems have effectively combined both types of resources and methods in order to exploit the fruitfulness of merging the two kinds of information repositories. The only evaluation QA track that focuses on hybrid QA is QALD since 2014. As it is a recent task, few annotated data are available (around 150 questions). In this paper, we present a question answering dataset that was constructed to develop and evaluate hybrid question answering systems. In order to create this corpus, we collected several textual corpora and augmented them with entities and relations of a knowledge base by retrieving paths in the knowledge base which allow to answer the questions. The resulting corpus contains 4300 question-answer pairs and 1600 have a true link with DBpedia.},

Deep learning models are widely used to address this problem and can fetch good results, provided there exists enough data for learning. Such large datasets have been released in open domain, but not in specific domains, such as the medical domain. However, the medical domain has a great amount of resources such as UMLS thesaurus, ontologies such as SNOMED CT, and tools such as Metamap etc that could be useful. In this paper, we apply transfer learning for getting a DNN baseline system on biomedical questions and we study if structured resources can help in selecting the answers based on the recognition of the Expected Answer Type (EAT), which has been proved useful in open domain QA systems. This study relies on different representations for LAT and we study if gold standard answers and answers of our model have some positive impact from the LAT.},

abstract = {AI and collective intelligence systems universally suffer from a deficiency of context. There are innumerable possible contexts that may possibly change the interpretation of some signal, that may change the proper response to some stimulus. For example, an image understanding system that does not recognize an arrest event in a zoomed image of a person's face. How is it possible to know there is more information, outside of what the system can access, that affects the interpretation of data The solution to the context problem in practice today is a pragmatic, engineering one: analyze errors (in recommendations, question answers, image recognition, etc.), classify the kinds of contextual information that caused the wrong behavior, find the most common type of context that causes errors, and add information about that kind of context to the system. Clearly this approach is neither general nor scalable, and ignores the infamous long tail of possible contextual information that may affect a system's understanding and its behavior. In this paper we outline a new, more general, approach to recognizing context. The approach is grounded in a fairly simple intuition: the mathematics underlying quantum mechanics is far more appropriate for modeling, and therefore simulating, human cognitive behavior than the standard toolset from classical statistics. Notions such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, superpositions of states, and entanglement have direct and measurable analogs in collective intelligence.},

abstract = {Dictionaries, encyclopedias, knowledge graphs, annotated corpora, library classification systems and world maps are all examples of human-curated knowledge resources that have been highly valuable to science as well as amortized across multiple large-scale systems in practice. Many of these were started and built even before a crowdsourcing research community existed. While the last decade has seen unprecedented growth in research and practice in building crowdsourcing systems to do increasingly complex tasks at scale, many of these resources are still woefully incompletelacking coverage in languages and subject matter domains. Moreover, many knowledge resources needed to fill other semantic gaps for artificial intelligence systems simply don't exist or arent being built. Why I argue that we don't have the right incentives, and that in order to improve the incentives, we have some fundamental scientific questions to answer. While building a large knowledge resource, we have little more than intuitions when it comes to estimating the reusability, maintainability, and long-term value of the effort. These make it difficult to fund or manage such projects, often requiring herculean personalities or fortunate businesses. Building or expanding a resource is often not seen as "sexy," which results in lack of resources to answer those questions in any principled manner. These problems begin to outline a new science of curation, making progress on which could help improve the discussion around and funding for building sorely needed knowledge resources.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing involves the creating of HITs (Human Intelligent Tasks), submitting them to a crowdsourcing platform and providing a monetary reward for each HIT. One of the advantages of using crowdsourcing is that the tasks can be highly parallelized, that is, the work is performed by a high number of workers in a decentralized setting. The design also offers a means to cross-check the accuracy of the answers by assigning each task to more than one person and thus relying on majority consensus as well as reward the workers according to their performance and productivity. Since each worker is paid per task, the costs can significantly increase, irrespective of the overall accuracy of the results. Thus, one important question when designing such crowdsourcing tasks that arise is how many workers to employ and how many tasks to assign to each worker when dealing with large amounts of tasks. That is, the main research questions we aim to answer is: 'Can we a-priori estimate optimal workers and tasks' assignment to obtain maximum accuracy on all tasks'. Thus, we introduce a two-staged statistical guideline, CrowdED, for optimal crowdsourcing experimental design in order to a-priori estimate optimal workers and tasks' assignment to obtain maximum accuracy on all tasks. We describe the algorithm and present preliminary results and discussions. We implement the algorithm in Python and make it openly available on Github, provide a Jupyter Notebook and a R Shiny app for users to re-use, interact and apply in their own crowdsourcing experiments.},

WITH excels existing cultural content aggregation platforms by advancing digital cultural data through the combination of artificial intelligence automation and creative user engagement, thus facilitating its accessibility, visibility, and re-use. In particular, by using image and free text analysis methodologies for automatic metadata enrichment, in accordance to the human expertise for enrichment and validation through crowdsourcing approaches with gamification elements, WITH combines the intelligence of humans and computers to improve the quality of digital cultural content and its presentation, establishing new ways of collaboration between cultural organizations and their audiences.},

This approach have been adopted in multiple domains and researchers are now able to reach a demographically diverse audience at low cost. However, it remains the question of whether the results are still valid and reliable. Previous work have introduced different mechanisms to ensure data reliability in crowdsourcing. This work examines to which extend, "trapping question" or "outliers detection" assure reliable results to the detriment of, overloading task content with stimuli that are not of interest for the researcher, or by discarding data points that might be the true opinion of a worker. To this end, a speech quality assessment study have been conducted in a web crowdsourcing platform, following the ITU-T Rec. P.800. Workers assessed the speech stimuli of the database 501 from the ITU-T Rec. P.863. We examine results' validity in terms of correlations to previous ratings collected in laboratory. Our outcomes shows that neither of the techniques under investigation improve results accuracy by itself, but a combination of both. Our goal is to provide empirical guidance for designing experiments in crowdsourcing while ensuring data reliability.},

abstract = {Domain-specific relation extraction requires training data for supervised learning models, and thus, significant labeling effort. Distant supervision is often leveraged for creating large annotated corpora however these methods require handling the inherent noise. On the other hand, active learning approaches can reduce the annotation cost by selecting the most beneficial examples to label in order to learn a good model. The choice of examples can be performed sequentially, i.e. select one example in each iteration, or in batches, i.e. select a set of examples in each iteration. The optimization of the batch size is a practical problem faced in every real-world application of active learning, however it is often treated as a parameter decided in advance. In this work, we study the trade-off between model performance, the number of requested labels in a batch and the time spent in each round for real-time, domain specific relation extraction. Our results show that the use of an appropriate batch size produces competitive performance, even compared to a fully sequential strategy, while reducing the training time dramatically.},

In this paper, we describe a set of experiments that use gamification techniques to transform this labelling task into an interactive learning process where users can cooperate in order to achieve a common goal. To this end, first we use a geometrical interpretation of Na\"{\i}ve Bayes (NB) classifiers in order to create an intuitive visualization of the current state of the system and let the user change some of the parameters directly as part of a game. We apply this visualization technique to the classification of newswire and we report the results of the experiments conducted with different groups of people: PhD students, Master Degree students and general public. Then, we present a preliminary experiment of query rewriting for systematic reviews in a medical scenario, which makes use of gamification techniques to collect different formulation of the same query. Both the experiments show how the exploitation of gamification approaches help to engage the users in abstract tasks that might be hard to understand and/or boring to perform.},

abstract = {Creating ontologies is an essential while challenging task to be performed by either a human or a system: on one hand it is excessively burdensome for a human operator, on the other it is very complex also for a machine due to the not negligible amount of "uncertainty" that it must be able to manage. In the last years, some attempts have been made to automate this process, but at present, due to the large number of aspects to be covered in the automatic creation of an ontology (such as Domain terminology extraction, Concept discovery, Concept hierarchy derivation, ") satisfactory solutions have not been reached yet. In order to produce efficient tools for both creation and enrichment of ontologies, the participation of the human in such a process still seems necessary. Our approach, that foresees a broader framework for ontology learning, is based by first on the automatic extraction of triples from heterogeneous sources, then on the presentation of the most reliable triples to the human operator for validation purposes. The system provides the user with a series of graphical representations that can give him an overview of the level of uncertainty of the automatically generated ontology. Then provides the user with the possibility to perform SPARQL what-if queries, (i.e. assuming as true the triples filtered according to the level of confidence, the source and the structure of the triples).},

Face and eye tracking which continuously measures viewers emotional responses and viewing interest on 169 television advertisements for 2334 participants, along with moment-to-moment branding activities in the advertisements are used to estimate the model. The resulting DBN represents relationships across advertisement content, viewers emotional responses, as well as effectiveness metrics such as ad avoidance, sharing and influence on purchase. Conditioned on the specified requirement on the ad, a human designer can draw high scoring samples from the DBN, which represent the optimized sequences of branding activities and entertainment content.},

abstract = {Blockchains are attracting the attention of many technical, financial, and industrial parties, as a promising infrastructure for achieving secure peer-to-peer (P2P) transactional systems. At the heart of blockchains is proof-of-work (PoW), a trustless leader election mechanism based on demonstration of computational power. PoW provides blockchain security in trusless P2P environments, but comes at the expense of wasting huge amounts of energy. In this research work, we question this energy expenditure of PoW under blockchain use cases where some form of trust exists between the peers. We propose a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) blockchain where peer trust is valuated in the network based on a trust graph that emerges in a decentralized fashion and that is encoded in and managed by the blockchain itself. This trust is then used as a waiver for the difficulty of PoW; that is, the more trust you prove in the network, the less work you do.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new idea of creating a Blockchain compliant distributed database which exposes its data with explicit semantics, is easily and natively accessible, and which applies Blockchain securitization mechanisms to the RDF graph data model directly, without additional packaging or specific serialisation. Essentially, the resulting database forms the linked chain of named RDF graphs and is given a name: GraphChain. Such graphs can then be published with the help of any standard mechanisms using triplestores or as linked data objects accessible via standard web mechanisms using the HTTP protocol to make them available on the web. They can also be easily queried using techniques like SPARQL or methods typical to available RDF graphs frameworks (like rdflib, Apache Jena, RDF4J, OWL API, RDF HDT, dotnetRDF and others). The GraphChain concept comes with its own, OWL-compliant ontology that defines all the structural, invariant elements of the GraphChain and defines their basic semantics. The paper describes also a few simple, prototypical GraphChain implementations with examples created using Java, .NET/C# and JavaScript/Node.js frameworks.},

These multi-billion flaws manifest themselves as the tax gap, or the inability to collect the full amount that is owed by a given entity to a particular authority. Illegitimate or inefficient tax operations could be prevented with a global suite of smart contracts deployed on top of a consortium distributed ledger with on-chain governance.

abstract = {The last decade has seen a huge expansion in the use of social media to extract data about human behaviour. While metadata and textual information have taken the lion's share as data sources for social media analysis, geotagged image-based platforms represent an unprecedented and as yet almost untapped source of data to analyse human behaviour and characterise the physical space we live in. In this paper we investigate the use of Instagram photos to analyse tourism consumption. We take the city of Venice (Italy) as a case study and we collect a dataset of about 90k photos taken between January 2014 and December 2015. Using computer vision techniques, we build a supervised classifier which assigns each photo to one of six different categories. We then observe how the frequency and spatial distribution of these categories varies with time. This in turn allows us to confirm the existence of a number of touristic hotspots associated with different events, such as Venice Carnival and Biennale. Our analysis also uncovers the existence of touristic flows associated with these events, such as the Folklore Line that marks the path of tourists from "Santa Lucia" railway station to "San Marco" square during the Carnival period. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework to investigate tourism consumption using Instagram data.},

abstract = {Travelling and touring are popular leisure activities enjoyed by millions of tourists around the world. However, the task of travel itinerary recommendation and planning is tedious and challenging for tourists, who are often unfamiliar with the various Points-of-Interest (POIs) in a city. Apart from identifying popular POIs, the tourist needs to construct a travel itinerary comprising a subset of these POIs, and to order these POIs as a sequence of visits that can be completed within his/her available touring time. For a more realistic itinerary, the tourist also has to account for travelling time between POIs and visiting times at individual POIs. Furthermore, this itinerary should incorporate tourist preferences such as desired starting and ending POIs (e.g., POIs that are near the tourist's hotel) and a subset of must-see POIs (e.g., popular POIs that a tourist must visit). We term this the TourMustSee problem, which is based on a variant of the Orienteering problem. Following which, we propose the LP+M algorithm for solving the TourMustSee problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Using a Flickr dataset of POI visits in seven touristic cities, we compare LP+M against various ILP-based baselines, and the results show that LP+M recommends better travel itineraries in terms of POI popularity, total POIs visited, total touring time utilized and must-visit POI(s) inclusion.},

Clusters appear in places of high floating population; however, hotspots vary in space depending on the application. Interestingly, we found that commuting plays an important role, both in terms of rush hours and transportation infrastructure. We present a discussion on these results, focusing on how the physical space and the daily commuting routine affect the pattern of data consumption and represent an important aspect in mobile users behavioral studies.},

The use of such models has been also supported by the increasing easiness in collecting multirelational data from the Web, e.g., from online social media platforms, crowdsourced data, online knowledge bases; within this view, the World Wide Web is an inestimable source of information, which can be conveniently represented with feature-rich network models, e.g., enclosing temporal aspects of the data, quantitative and/or qualitative properties of nodes, different relations between a common set of entities, different existence probabilities, or modeling connection between different entity types.},

abstract = {Social networks can be modeled as attributed networks whose nodes represent users, edges represent relationships among users (e.g. friendship/follow) and attribute vectors hold properties of nodes and/or edges. In this paper, we consider friends' recommendation based on interest-based communities generated from topic based attributed social networks (TbASN). In our model, an attribute vector is not just a container for explicit users' profile data that is stored in social network's dataset, but rather holds topic vectors that are derived from analyzing the implicit interest of users' that are aggregated from his/her posts on the social network (e.g. tweets in Twitter, posts in Facebook). In our framework, topics of interest are represented as a hierarchy of topics (Topics/Subtopics) forming hierarchical interest-based communities. Users within each interest-based community are clustered according to their profile features (age, location, education etc.). Those clusters are later used in recommendations where recommendations target members of the same cluster to guarantee the quality and coherence of recommendations. In addition, we propose a recommendation selection approach to handle the large number of recommended candidates. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it considers multiple criteria for candidate selection including the number of common communities, the resemblance in basic features, as well as network proximity. In addition to recommending friends of similar interests, frequent pattern mining is used to discover frequently occurring interests in order to be used in recommending communities for users to join. Although our approach is generic and can be applied to most of the existing social networks, we used Twitter as our target social network.},

abstract = {Network embedding aims to learn low-dimensional vector representations for nodes in a network that preserve structural characteristics. It has been shown that such representations are helpful in several graph mining tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Some recent works have attempted to extend the approach to attributed networks in which each node is associated with a set of attribute values. They have focused on homophily relationships by forcing nodes with similar attribute values to obtain similar vector representations. This is unnecessarily restrictive and misses the opportunity to harness other types of relationships revealed by patterns in attribute values of connected nodes for learning insightful relationships. In this paper, we propose a new network attributed embedding framework called A3embed that is aware of attribute associations. A3embed favors significant attribute associations, not merely homophily relationships, which contributes to its robustness to diverse attribute vectors and noisy links. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better performance on different graph mining tasks compared to existing models.},

abstract = {Network embedding is a method for converting nodes in a network into low dimensional vectors, preserving its structure and the similarities among the nodes. Embedding is widely used in many applications, e.g., social network analysis and knowledge discovery. Because of its wide usage, many studies have been proposed, such as DeepWalk, LINE and node2vec. These works are designed for single-layer networks, however, real world networks often possess not just one, but multiple types of connections. Hence it is more appropriate to represent them as multiplex networks, which consist of multiple layers each of which represents one type of relationship. Embedding multiplex networks is difficult because all layer structures have to be taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose MELL, a novel embedding method for multiplex networks, which incorporates an idea of layer vector that captures and characterizes each layer's connectivity. This method exploits the overall structure effectively, and embeds both directed and undirected multiplex networks, whether their layer structures are similar or complementary. We focus on link prediction tasks and test our method and other baseline methods using five data sets from different domains. The results show that our method outperforms all of the baseline methods for all of the data sets.},

abstract = {When an epidemic occurs, it is often impossible to vaccinate the entire population due to limited amount of resources. Therefore, it is of prime interest to identify the set of influential spreaders to immunize, in order to minimize both the cost of vaccine resource and the disease spreading. While various strategies based on the network topology have been introduced, few works consider the influence of the community structure in the epidemic spreading process. Nowadays, it is clear that many real-world networks exhibit an overlapping community structure, in which nodes are allowed to belong to more than one community. Previous work shows that the numbers of communities to which a node belongs is a good measure of its epidemic influence. In this work, we address the effect of nodes in the neighborhood of the overlapping nodes on epidemics spreading. The proposed immunization strategy provides highly connected neighbors of overlapping nodes in the network to immunize. The whole process requires information only at the node level and is well suited to large-scale networks. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks of diverse nature have been performed. Comparisons with alternative local immunization strategies using the fraction of the Largest Connected Component (LCC) after immunization,show that the proposed method is much more efficient. Additionally, it compares favorably to global measures such as degree and betweenness centrality.},

abstract = {Relational inference leverages relationships between entities and links in a network to infer information about the network from a small sample. This method is often used when global information about the network is not available or difficult to obtain. However, how reliable is inference from a small labeled sample How should the network be sampled, and what effect does it have on inference error How does the structure of the network impact the sampling strategy We address these questions by systematically examining how network sampling strategy and sample size affect accuracy of relational inference in networks. To this end, we generate a family of synthetic networks where nodes have a binary attribute and a tunable level of homophily. As expected, we find that in heterophilic networks, we can obtain good accuracy when only small samples of the network are initially labeled, regardless of the sampling strategy. Surprisingly, this is not the case for homophilic networks, and sampling strategies that work well in heterophilic networks lead to large inference errors. This finding suggests that the impact of network structure on relational classification is more complex than previously thought.},

abstract = {In two-mode networks there are two kinds of vertices, i.e objects, each being possibly described with a proper attribute set. This means that to select a subnetwork according to vertex descriptions we have to consider a pair of vertex subsets. A common technique is to extract from a network an essential subnetwork, the core subgraph of the network. Formal Concept Analysis and closed pattern mining were previously applied to networks with the purpose of reducing extensions of patterns to be core subgraphs. To apply this methodology to two-mode networks, we need to consider the two vertex subsets of two-mode cores and define accordingly abstract closed bi-patterns. Each component of a bi-pattern is then associated to one mode. We also show that the same methodology applies to hub-authority cores of directed networks in which each vertex subset is associated to a role (in or out). We illustrate the methodology both on a two-mode network of epistemological data and on a directed advice network of lawyers.},

This is our 9th edition of our workshop. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn have paved the way for generating huge amount of diverse, streaming bit data in a short period of time. Such social media data require the application of big data analytics to produce meaningful information to both information consumers and data generators. Machine learning and AI techniques are particularly effective in situations where deep and predictive insights need to be uncovered from such social media data sets that are large, diverse and fast changing. The workshop aims to address machine learning and AI methods, frameworks, algorithms, and the applications and evaluation of these approaches on social media, big data and the web. We received 11 papers from all around the world covering a broad range of topics, and we accepted 8 papers resulting in a 72% acceptance rate. We evaluated them regarding relevance, quality, and novelty, selecting 4 full papers and 4 short papers. Each paper was reviewed by 3 reviewers and then decisions were made from the reviews and the workshop chairs.},

It has many applications such as human mobility analysis, traffic planning, and abnormal event detection. In this paper, we formulate tweet count prediction as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem and design an end-to-end convolutional LSTM based network with skip connection for this problem. Such a model enables us to exploit the unique properties of spatiotemporal data, consisting of not only the temporal characteristics such as temporal closeness, period and trend properties but also spatial dependencies. Our experiments on the city of Seattle, WA as well as a larger city of New York City show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the competitive baseline approaches.},

Despite that social networking sites allow users to set their privacy preferences, this can be cumbersome for the vast majority of users. In this paper, we explore privacy prediction models for social media that can automatically identify private (or sensitive) content from images, before they are shared online, in order to help protect users' privacy in social media. More precisely, we study "deep" visual features that are extracted from various layers of a pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as well as "deep" image tags generated from the CNN. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset of thousands of images show that the deep visual features and deep image tags can successfully identify images' private content and substantially outperform previous models for this task.},

abstract = {We propose a model of a social networking service (SNS) with diminishing marginal utility in the framework of evolutionary computing and present our investigation on the effect of diminishing marginal utility on the dominant structure of strategies in all agents. SNSs such as Twitter and Facebook have been growing rapidly, but why they are prospering is unknown. SNSs have the characteristics of a public goods game because they are maintained by users posting many articles that incur some cost and because users can also be free riders, who just read articles. Thus, a number of studies aimed at understanding the conditions or mechanisms that keep social media thriving theoretically by introducing the meta-rewards game, which is a variation of a public goods game. The meta-rewards games assume constant marginal utility, meaning that the rewards by receiving comments increase linearly according to the number of comments, but describing the psychological rewards of humans is often inappropriate. In this paper, we present our modification of the model using the diminishing marginal utility and our comparison of the experimental results with those of the original meta-rewards game. We demonstrate that the structure of dominant strategies of all agents in our game is quite different from that in the original meta-rewards game and is more reasonable to explain the users' behavior in SNSs because their efforts in SNSs are limited even if they have many friends.},

Identifying this type of bot is particularly challenging, with state-of-the-art methods utilising large volumes of network data as features for machine learning models. Such datasets are generally not readily available in typical applications which stream social media data for real-time event prediction. In this work we develop a methodology to detect content polluters in social media datasets that are streamed in real-time. Applying our method to the problem of civil unrest event prediction in Australia, we identify content polluters from individual tweets, without collecting social network or historical data from individual accounts. We identify some peculiar characteristics of these bots in our dataset and propose metrics for identification of such accounts. We then pose some research questions around this type of bot detection, including: how good Twitter is at detecting content polluters and how well state-of-the-art methods perform in detecting bots in our dataset.},

We present a novel idea that combines the neural, statistical and external features to provide an efficient solution to this problem. We compute the neural embedding from the deep recurrent model, statistical features from the weighted n-gram bag-of-words model and handcrafted external features with the help of feature engineering heuristics. Finally, using deep neural layer all the features are combined, thereby classifying the headline-body news pair as agree, disagree, discuss, or unrelated. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed model outperforms all the state-of-the-art techniques including the submissions to the fake news challenge.},

abstract = {Knowledge in the world continuously evolves, and ontologies are largely incomplete, especially regarding data belonging to the so-called long tail. We propose a method for discovering emerging knowledge by extracting it from social content. Once initialized by domain experts, the method is capable of finding relevant entities by means of a mixed syntactic-semantic method. The method uses seeds, i.e. prototypes of emerging entities provided by experts, for generating candidates; then, it associates candidates to feature vectors built by using terms occurring in their social content and ranks the candidates by using their distance from the centroid of seeds, returning the top candidates. Our method can run iteratively, using the results as new seeds. as new seeds. In this paper we address the following research questions: (1) How does the reconstructed domain knowledge evolve if the candidates of one extraction are recursively used as seeds (2) How does the reconstructed domain knowledge spread geographically (3) Can the method be used to inspect the past, present, and future of knowledge (4) Can the method be used to find emerging knowledge},

Traditional IR methods such as TF-IDF fail to handle efficiently large datasets. In this paper we present a scalable approach that allows real time recommendation of users based on their tweets. Our model builds a graph of terms, driven by the fact that users sharing similar interests will share similar terms. We show how this model can be encoded as a compact binary footprint, that allows very fast comparison and ranking, taking full advantage of modern CPU architectures. We validate our approach through an empirical evaluation against the Apache Lucene's implementation of TF-IDF. We show that our approach is in average two hundred times faster than standard optimised implementation of TF-IDF with a precision of 58%.

These systems have become ubiquitous and are an essential tool for information filtering and (e-)commerce. Over the years, collaborative filtering, which derive these recommendations by leveraging past activities of groups of users, has emerged as the most prominent approach for solving this problem. This talk will present some of our recent work towards improving the performance of collaborative filtering-based recommender systems and understanding some of their fundamental limitations and characteristics. It will start by analyzing how the ratings that users provide to a set of items relate to their ratings of the set's individual items and, using these insights, will present rating prediction approaches that utilize distant supervision. It will then discuss extensions to approaches based on sparse linear and latent factor models that postulate that users' preferences are a combination of global and local preferences, which are shown to lead to better user modeling and as such improved prediction performance. Finally, the talk will conclude by discussing what can be accurately predicted by latent factor approaches and by analyzing the estimation error of sparse linear and latent factor models and how its characteristics impacts the performance of top N recommendation algorithms.},

To achieve this, the system should address three objectives: (1) match the worker with suitable tasks that fit the worker's interests and skills and raise the worker's rewards and rating, (2) give the employer more acceptable solutions with lower cost and time and raise the employer's rating, and (3) raise the rate of accepted tasks, which will raise the aggregated commissions to the service provider and improve the average rating of the registered users (employers and workers) accordingly. For these objectives, we present a mechanism design that is capable of reaching holistic satisfaction using a multi-objective recommendation system. In contrast, all previous crowdsourcing recommendation systems are designed to address one stakeholder who could be either the worker or the employer. Moreover, our unique contribution is to consider each stakeholder to be self serving. Considering selfish behavior from every stakeholder, we provide a more qualified recommendation for each stakeholder.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RS) have seen widespread adoption across the Internet. However, by emphasizing personalization through the optimization of accuracy-focused metrics, over-personalization may emerge, with negative effects on the user experience. A countermeasure to the problem is to diversify recommendations. In this paper, we present a solution that addresses the problem in the context of a movie application domain. The solution enhances diversity on four related dimensions, namely global coverage, local coverage, novelty, and redundancy. The proposed solution is designed to diversify users profiles, modeled on categorical preferences, within the same group in the recommendation filtering. We evaluate our approach on the Movielens dataset and show that our algorithm yields better results compared to random selection distant neighbors and performs comparably to one of the current state of the art solutions.},

abstract = {Traditional collaborative filtering, and content-based approaches attempt to learn a static recommendation model in a batch fashion. These approaches are not suitable in highly dynamic recommendation scenarios, like news recommendation and computational advertisement. Due to this well-known limitation, in the last decade a lot of efforts have been spent over the study of online learning techniques. Currently, a lot of attention has been devoted to improvements on the theoretical guarantees, without caring too much about computational cost and memory footprint. However, in the era of big-data content features tend to be high-dimensional, which leads to a direct challenge for traditional on-line learning algorithms (e.g., multi-armed bandits) since these are mostly designed for low-dimensional feature spaces. In this work we face the aforementioned problem, investigating an approximated context-aware bandit learner. Our model takes into account the problem of finding the actual low-dimensional manifold spanned by data content-features. In particular, we propose to store the covariance matrix of the previously seen contexts in a compressed space, without losing too much in terms of recommendation quality. With this work we provide an overview over the main properties, describe the adopted techniques, and report on preliminary experimental results on a synthetic dataset. We also discuss a drawback of the proposed method that may appear in typical scenarios and suggest future research avenues.},

These approaches have tried to capture the recency of news with respect to their short life span, by using either decaying weights on past articles or even forgetting them. However, most of these approaches have missed to consider sessions, which encapsulate inside them the articles that a user has interacted with in a short time period. In this paper, we provide news recommendations based on user sessions to reveal their short-term intentions. We also combine content-based with collaborative filtering to deal with the severe data sparsity problem that exists in our real-life data set. We have experimentally seen that the users' interests evolve over time and that our strategies can adapt fast to these changes.},

Recent studies have focused on exploring people's emotional response to their urban environment, e.g., green spaces versus built up areas, through analysing the sentiment of tweets within that area. Since green spaces have the capacity to improve citizen's well-being, we developed a system that is capable of recommending green spaces to users. Our system is unique in the sense that the recommendations are tailored with regard to users' preferred activity as well as the degree of positive sentiments in each green space. We show that the incoming flow of tweets can be used to refine the recommendations over time. Furthermore, We implemented a web-based, user-friendly interface to solicit user inputs and display recommendation results.},

Against the backdrop of this situation, a basic question has received comparatively little attention: how many ads are good enough to get higher user satisfaction and better monetization Most search engines always display a fixed number of ads or use heuristic rules to determine the number of ads. In this paper, we formulate the task of finding the best number of ads into a linear programming optimization problem, for which we propose a novel online algorithm to solve. We have conducted several offline experiments and tested our approach in Alibaba E-commerce platform. The experimental results show that the platform could achieve higher revenue and more clicks simultaneously by the proposed algorithm.},

Traditional models for recommendation only take into account the user-item interaction, usually expressed by explicit ratings. However, in these days, web services continuously generate auxiliary data from users and items that can be incorporated into the recommendation model to improve recommendations. In this work, we propose an incremental Matrix Co-factorization model with implicit user feedback, considering a real-world data-stream scenario. This model can be seen as an extension of the conventional Matrix Factorization that includes additional dimensions to be decomposed in the common latent factor space. We test our proposal against a baseline algorithm that relies exclusively on interaction data, using prequential evaluation. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, after incorporating an additional dimension in three music domain datasets.},

abstract = {With the explosion of the volume of user-generated data, designing online recommender systems that learn from data streams has become essential. These systems rely on incremental learning that continuously update models as new observations arrive and they should be able to adapt to drifts in real-time. User preferences evolve over time and tracking their evolution is not an easy task. In addition to the low number of observations available per user, the preferences change at different moments and in different ways for each individual. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on local models to address this problem. Local models are known for their ability to capture diverse preferences among user subsets. Our approach automatically detects the drift of preferences that leads a user to adopt a behavior closer to the users of another subset, and adjusts the models accordingly. Our experiments on real world datasets show promising results and prove the effectiveness of using local models to adapt to changes in user preferences.},

abstract = {Large-scale online civic engagements (OCEs) with more than 100 participants have become possible due to recent developments in online social media technology. OCEs have the potential to achieve consensus building and collective decision-making with a large number of citizens, which is difficult to achieve in face-to-face contexts. However, most users in a large-scale OCE are rarely constantly active. Therefore, an important problem for the activation of a large-scale OCE is to facilitate the discussion by predicting which citizens will have significant influence in the discussion. This paper examines the activation prediction problem in a large-scale OCE. We propose a novel influence model based on the impulse response of activity histories and argumentative pressures, as well as an effective testing algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models with impulse response and the lexical pressures show better accuracy compared with baselines. In addition, the testing time required by the proposed method can be reduced significantly by employing a node-cutting algorithm.},

abstract = {Modelling information cascades over online social networks is important in fields from marketing to civil unrest prediction, however the underlying network structure strongly affects the probability and nature of such cascades. Even with simple cascade dynamics the probability of large cascades are almost entirely dictated by network properties, with well-known networks such as Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert producing wildly different cascades from the same model. Indeed, the notion of 'superspreaders' has arisen to describe highly influential nodes promoting global cascades in a social network. Here we use a simple model of global cascades to show that the presence of locality in the network increases the probability of a global cascade due to the increased vulnerability of connecting nodes. Rather than 'super-spreaders', we find that the presence of these highly connected 'super-blockers' in heavy-tailed networks in fact reduces the probability of global cascades, while promoting information spread when targeted as the initial spreader.},

abstract = {Social media interaction happens in a broad variety of context and magnitude. The vast majority of posts cause little to no discussion, while some start trends and become viral. We study the virality, explicitly of "Buzzes" - posts that evoke intense interaction over a short period of time, as they have been observed frequently, some- times with severe consequences for individuals and companies in the physical world. Early detection of a Buzz may help mitigate or prevent negative consequences of large scale social media outrage against companies or persons, by giving them a chance to react at an early stage. Collecting a labeled set of over 100,000 posts on Facebook pages, we first explore properties that define a Buzz using logistic regres- sion. This method helps us to interpret the results and derive prac- tical recommendations. We subsequently train classifiers and apply machine learning based classification techniques to demonstrate the potential capabilities of automated prediction. We achieve high recall with moderate precision, where feature boosting on broad feature sets yields the most promising results. Our study reveals that Buzzes are well described by a high num- ber of comments from previously passive users, a high number of likes given to comments, and a prolonged discussion period - properties that can be used to distinguish inconsequential posts from potentially volatile ones.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the posting behavior of OSN users, in particular the posting frequency and temporal patterns, and consider possible interpretations of how users use the platform. At the aggregate (macro) level, we find two distinct peaks, one during morning working hours, and one in the evening. The morning peak is more pronounced for frequent posters, while the evening peak is pronounced in the remaining users. We postulate that this difference results from qualitatively different usage of the OSN platform (e.g. for work, with customers, etc.) than purely social interactions (e.g., friends, family, etc.). We also study user posting behavior at an individual (micro) level and apply LDA to cluster user temporal patterns, interpret our results. Our study provides possibly new insights into user activity in today's OSNs, and suggests a framework for profiling users based on their posting activities. In the process, we provide a novel application of LDA, to temporal user posting behavior by equating the time epochs of posts to words in documents. We believe our approach will complement other methods of user profiling based on static demographic information and friendship network information.},

Having the CSC score available may inspire social behavior and mutual support. The system is based on three pillars: the analysis of OSNEM activity, interactions in virtual social capital market systems, and personal endorsements. In this paper we present our investigations regarding the first pillar. To obtain a dataset, we ran an experiment where 165 participants interacted on a custom social networking platform and assessed each other. Ground truth data was derived from these assessments. The dataset shows characteristics that are similar to larger OSNs. With different machine learning algorithms we investigated the hypothesis that contributive social capital can be extracted from network properties and networking activity, which were assessed with features such as the number of contributions of each participant. The prediction of contributive social capital showed an improvement over the baseline. A ranking of the participants following their predicted CSC scores showed a moderate correlation with the ranking according to the ground truth assessment. We also investigated the relative importance of the features for the analysis, and the effect of excluding inactive users to better understand network dynamics on a micro level. The selected features are also available in most other OSNEM platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. This allows a large-scale application of our investigations.},

Particularly interesting are the cognitive constraints associated with the interactions between the ego and the members of their ego network, whereby individuals cannot maintain meaningful interactions with more than 150 people, on average. In this work, we focus on the ego networks of journalists on Twitter, and we investigate whether they feature the same characteristics observed for other relevant classes of Twitter users, like politicians and generic users. Our findings are that journalists are generally more active and interact with more people than generic users. Their ego network structure is very aligned with reference models derived from the social brain hypothesis and observed in general human ego networks. Remarkably, the similarity is even higher than the one of politicians and generic users ego networks. This may imply a greater cognitive involvement with Twitter than with other social interaction means. Moreover, the ego networks of journalists are much stabler than those of politicians and generic users, and the ego-alter ties are often information-driven.},

This includes looking at the specifics of data-centric information seeking behaviours, understanding interaction challenges in data search on the web, and analysing the cognitive processes involved in the consumption of structured data by users. At the same time, we aim to discuss technologies addressing data search including semantics, information retrieval for web data (ranking algorithms and indexing), in particular in the context of decentralised and distributed systems, such as the web. We are interested in approaches to analyse, characterise and discover data sources. We want to facilitate a discussion around data search across formats and domain-specific applications. The PROFILES &amp; DATA:SEARCH Workshop includes papers on a variety of topics such as profiling and data search, including querying and searching for structured data, profiling applications for cultural heritage, as well as data quality improvements through schema inference, content analysis and communities.},

abstract = {Graphs are being increasingly adopted as a flexible data model in scenarios (e.g., Google's Knowledge Graph, Facebook's Graph API, Wikidata, etc.) where multiple editors are involved in content creation, where the schema is ever changing, where data are incomplete, where the connectivity of resources plays a key rolescenarios where relational models traditionally struggle. But with this flexibility comes a conceptual cost: it can be difficult to summarise and understand, at a high level, the content that a given graph contains. Hence profiling graphs becomes of increasing importance to extract order, a posteriori, from the chaotic processes by which such graphs are generated. This talk will motivate the use of graphs as a data model, abstract recent trends in graph data management, and then turn to the issue of profiling and summarising graphs: what are the goals of such profiling, the principles by which graphs can be summarised, the main techniques by which this can/could be achieved The talk will emphasise the importance of profiling graphs while highlighting a variety of open research questions yet to be tackled.},

In this paper we explore dataset search by analysing queries specifically generated for this work through a crowdsourcing experiment and comparing them to a search log analysis of queries on data portals. The change in search environment together with the task we gave people altered the generated queries. We found that queries issued in our experiment were much longer than search queries for datasets on data portals. They further contained seven times more mentions of geospatial and of temporal information and are more likely to be structured as questions. These insights can be used to tailor search functionalities to the particular information needs and characteristics of dataset search.},

abstract = {Cultural heritage (CH) resources are very heterogeneous since the information was collected from vast diversity of cultural sites and digitally recorded in different formats. With the progress of 3D technologies, photogrammetry techniques become the adopted solution for representing CH artifacts by turning photos from small finds, to entire landscapes, into accurate 3D models. To meet knowledge representation with cultural heritage photogrammetry, this paper proposes an ontology-profiling method for modeling a real case of archaeological amphorae. The ontological profile consists of all needed information to represent a CH resource including typology attributes, geo-spatial information and photogrammetry process. An example illustrating the applicability of this profiling method to the problem of CH resources conceptualization is presented. We also outline our perspectives for using ontologies in data-driven science, in particular on modeling a complete pipeline that manages both the photogrammetric process and the archaeological knowledge.},

abstract = {The Semantic Web promotes common data formats and exchange protocols on the web towards better interoperability among systems and machines. Although Semantic Web technologies are being used to semantically annotate data and resources for easier reuse, the ad hoc discovery of these data sources remains an open issue. Popular Semantic Web endpoint repositories such as SPARQLES, Linking Open Data Project (LOD Cloud), and LODStats do not include recently published datasets and are not updated frequently by the publishers. Hence, there is a need for a web-based dynamic search engine that discovers these endpoints and datasets at frequent intervals. To address this need, a novel web meta-crawling method is proposed for discovering Linked Data sources on the Web. We implemented the method in a prototype system named SPARQL Endpoints Discovery (SpEnD). In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of SpEnD, together with an analysis and evaluation of its operation, in comparison to the aforementioned static endpoint repositories in terms of time performance, availability, and size. Findings indicate that SpEnD outperforms existing Linked Data resource discovery methods.},

abstract = {Impoverished descriptions and convoluted schema labels are common challenges in data-centric tasks such as schema matching and data linking, especially when datasets can span domains. To address these issues, we consider the task of schema label generation. Typically, schema labels are created by dataset providers and are useful for users to understand a dataset. The motivation behind the task is that a lot of data linking systems require overlapping information between two datasets and rely on unique identifiers of schema labels. Moreover, it is common for schema labels in different datasets to have different identifiers even when they refer to the same concept. With no naming standard for schema labels, unintelligible labels are widely found in real-world datasets. For example, many schema labels contain abbreviations and compound nouns that hinder automated matching of attributes in corresponding datasets. Through schema label generation, more common (and thus understandable) schema labels can be provided to allow for broader schema matches in contexts such as dataset search and data linking. We develop a variety of features based on analysis of dataset content to enable machine learning methods to recommend useful labels. We test our approach on two real-world data collections and demonstrate that our method is able to outperform the alternative approach.},

The workshop becomes a venue for computer scientists, data scientists and social scientists to create bridges of knowledge. The complexity of the societal phenomena emerging from the development in web technologies urge for interdisciplinary collaboration. Following the slightly futuristic approach to technology of the British-made sci-fi series Black Mirror, we called scientists to create their dystopic scenarios developed from their own existing technologies. Through this thought experiment, researchers considered potential ethical and social risks of technological advancements offering in some cases possible solutions.},

abstract = {Social Media has transformed modern day society. It can be argued that one of the main drivers behind this transformation are novel ways to effectively distribute content in a highly targeted fashion and at scale. Recently, this effectiveness has come under attack based on new phenomena known as Fake News, Filter Bubble and Echo Chambers. The public debate about the impact of these phenomena on modern day society ranges from demanding a complete social media shutdown to government intervention and censorship. Furthermore, it appears that Social Media Platform providers are not sure what countermeasures are needed to address these new challenges. The main concern is that Black Mirror like scenarios will emerge simply by allowing privately held companies decide what content is conforming to public norms leading to a distortion of values. This paper presents an alternative solution by focusing on empowering meaningful relationships and not content engagement. The main motivation behind the proposed solution is to create social networks that follow a Trust by Design paradigm. This paper introduces and discusses the above-­mentioned challenges and presents a novel new social media concept seeking to overcome current challenges.},

abstract = {What would happen in a world where people could "see'' others' hidden emotions directly through some visualizing technology Would lies become uncommon and would we understand each other better Or to the contrary, would such forced honesty make it impossible for a society to exist The science fiction television show Black Mirror has exposed a number of darker scenarios in which such futuristic technologies, by blurring the lines of what is private and what is not, could also catalyze suffering. Thus, the current paper first turns an eye towards identifying some potential pitfalls in emotion visualization which could lead to psychological or physical harm, miscommunication, and disempowerment. Then, some countermeasures are proposed and discussed--including some level of control over what is visualized and provision of suitably rich emotional information comprising intentions--toward facilitating a future in which emotion visualization could contribute toward people's well-being. The scenarios presented here are not limited to web technologies, since one typically thinks about emotion recognition primarily in the context of direct contact. However, as interfaces develop beyond today's keyboard and monitor, more information becomes available also at a distance--for example, speech-to-text software could evolve to annotate any dictated text with a speaker's emotional state.},

Part of our brain will be committed to cryptographic calculations (mining), leaving the remaining part untouched for everyday operations, i.e., for our brain's normal daily activity. In this short paper, we briefly argue why this set-up might not be so far fetched after all, and explore the impact that such a technology could have on our lives and our society.},

abstract = {The use of personal data is a double-edged sword that on one side provides benefits through personalisation and user profiling, while the other raises several ethical and moral implications that impede technological progress. Laws often try to reflect the shifting values of social perception, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) catering to explicit consent over use of personal data, though actions may still be legal without being perceived as acceptable. Black Mirror is a TV series that serves to imagine scenarios that test the boundary of such perceptions, and is often described as being futuristic. In this paper, we discuss how existing technologies have already coalesced towards calculating a probability metric or rating as presented by the episode 'Nosedive'. We present real-world instances of such technologies and their applications, and how they can be easily expanded using the interminable web. The dilemma posed by the ethics of such technological applications is discussed using the 'Ethics Canvas', our methodology and tool for encouraging discussions on ethical implications in responsible innovation.},

Although they can benefit from efficient incremental maintenance algorithms capable of handling frequent data updates, existing rule-based algorithms cause successive re-derivations of previously inferred information. In this paper, we propose an incremental maintenance approach for rule-based reasoning that prevents successive re-computations of fact derivations. We tag (i.e. annotate) facts to keep trace of their provenance and validity. We compare our solution with the DRed-based incremental reasoning algorithm and show that it significantly outperforms this algorithm for fact updates in re-occurring situations, to the cost of tagging facts at their first insertion. Our experiments show that this cost can be recovered within a small number of cycles of deletions and reinsertions of explicit facts. We discuss the utility and limitations of our approach on Web clients and provide implementation packages of this reasoner that can be directly integrated in Web applications, on both server and client sides.},

Moreover, both approaches do not necessarily yield the same result. We suggest that grounding the evaluation on query containment allows for a data-independent evaluation that is more informative than the usual syntactic evaluation. In addition, such evaluation modalities may take into account ontologies, alignments or different query languages as soon as they are relevant to query evaluation.},

While it is known that the data complexity of answering conjunctive queries w.r.t. FL0 ontologies is coNP-complete, the exact complexity of answering instance queries was open until now. In the present paper, we show that answering instance queries w.r.t. FL0 ontologies is in P for data complexity. Together with the known lower bound of P-completeness for a fragment of FL0, this closes the gap mentioned above.},

abstract = {Hurricane evacuation is a complex process and a better understanding of the evacuation behavior of the coastal residents could be helpful in planning better evacuation policy. Traditionally, various aspects of the household evacuation decisions have been determined by post-evacuation questionnaire surveys, which are usually time-consuming and expensive. Increased activity of users on social media, especially during emergencies, along with the geo-tagging of the posts, provides an opportunity to gain insights into user's decision-making process, as well as to gauge public opinion and activities using the social media data as a supplement to the traditional survey data. This paper leverages the geo-tagged Tweets posted in the New York City (NYC) in wake of Hurricane Sandy to understand the evacuation behavior of the residents. Based on the geo-tagged Tweet locations, we classify the NYC Twitter users into one of the three categories: outside evacuation zone, evacuees, and non-evacuees and examine the types of Tweets posted by each group during different phases of the hurricane. We establish a strong link between the social connectivity with the decision of the users to evacuate or stay. We analyze the geo-tagged Tweets to understand evacuation and return time and evacuation location patterns of evacuees. The analysis presented in this paper could be useful for authorities to plan a better evacuation campaign to minimize the risk to the life of the residents of the emergency hit areas.},

abstract = {Proper formulation of features plays an important role in short-text classification tasks as the amount of text available is very little. In literature, Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is commonly used to create feature vectors for such tasks. However, TF-IDF formulation does not utilize the class information available in supervised learning. For classification problems, if it is possible to identify terms that can strongly distinguish among classes, then more weight can be given to those terms during feature construction phase. This may result in improved classifier performance with the incorporation of extra class label related information. We propose a supervised feature construction method to classify tweets, based on the actionable information that might be present, posted during different disaster scenarios. Improved classifier performance for such classification tasks can be helpful in the rescue and relief operations. We used three benchmark datasets containing tweets posted during Nepal and Italy earthquakes in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains better classification performance on these benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {With the rapid growing of social networking services (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), being able to process data come from such platforms has gained much attention in recent years. SocialNLP is a new inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. There are three plausible directions of SocialNLP: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. Several challenges are foreseeable in SocialNLP. First, the message lengths on social media are usu-ally short, and thus it is difficult to apply traditional NLP approaches directly. Second, social media contains heterogeneous information (e.g. tags, friends, followers, likes, and retweets) that should be considered together with the contents for better quality of analysis. Finally, social media contents always involve multiple persons with slangs and jargons, and usually require special techniques to process. We organize SocialNLP in WWW 2018 with three goals. First, social media data is essentially generated and collected from online social services that are functioned based on Web techniques. One can leverage Web techniques to investigate various user behaviors and investigate the interactions between users. Second, user-generated data in social media is mainly in the form of text. Theories and techniques on Web information retrieval and natural language processing are desired for semantic understanding, accurate search, and efficient processing of big social media data. Third, from the perspective of application, if social media data can be effectively processed to distill the collective knowledge of users, novel Web applications, such as emergency management, social recommendation, and future prediction, can be developed with higher accuracy and better user experience. We expect SocialNLP workshop in WWW community can provide mutually-reinforced benefits for researchers in areas of Web techniques, information retrieval and social media analytics.},

With the increasing popularity of online social network platforms and the advances in data science, more research efforts have been spent on understanding mental disorders through social media by analysing linguistic style, sentiment, online social networks and other activity traces. However, the role of basic emotions and their changes over time, have not yet been fully explored in extant work. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for identifying users with or at risk of depression by incorporating measures of eight basic emotions as features from Twitter posts over time, including a temporal analysis of these features. The results showed that emotion-related expressions can reveal insights of individuals' psychological states and emotions measured from such expressions show predictive power of identifying depression on Twitter. We also demonstrated that the changes in an individual's emotions as measured over time bear additional information and can further improve the effectiveness of emotions as features, hence, improve the performance of our proposed model in this task.},

abstract = {Social media provides a vast continuous supply of dynamic and diverse information contents from the crowd, which serves as useful resources for predictive analytical applications. Although there exist already a number of studies on emerging topics detection, they focused on modelling of textual contents and emerging detection mechanism over topic popularity. To meet the real-life demands, prediction of emerging product topic, rather than detection, in the early stage is required. Besides, despite that some relevant studies considered social structure information, they suffer from the assumption that the complete network is available and the diffusion process only depends on social influence among members of networks. Moreover, not all social media sites provide the functionality to facilitate the development of online social networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of emerging product topics prediction in social network with implicit networks. Two tasks, one for long-term forecast in pre-production stage and the other for short-term forecast in post-release stage, are investigated. We present a novel framework named Emerging Topics Predictor (ETP). Two novel features, namely author diversity and competition features, are also proposed to accommodate the diffusion process with implicit networks based on the rationale of product marketing. Through empirical evaluation on movie reviews from two real social media sites, ETP is shown to provide effective and efficient performance in predicting the emerging topics as early as possible. In particular, the experiment results show the promising effect of author diversity in emerging prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the very first studies on emerging product topic prediction in social media with considerations of implicit networks.},

abstract = {Product reviews on modern e-commerce websites have evolved into repositories of valuable firsthand opinions on products. Showcasing the opinions that reviewers express on a product in a succinct way can not only promote the product, but also provide an engaging experience that simplifies the shopping journey for online shoppers. In the case of traditional media such as movies and books, employingblurbs or excerpts from critic reviews for promotional purposes is an established practice among movie publicists and book editors that has proven to be an effective way of capturing attention of customers. Such excerpts can be discovered from e-commerce product reviews to highlight interesting reviewer opinions and add emotive elements to otherwise bland e-commerce product pages. While traditional movie or book blurbs are manually extracted, they must be automatically extracted from e-commerce product reviews owing to the scale of catalogues. Further, traditional blurbs are generally phrased to be very positive in tone and sometimes may take some words out of context. However, excerpts for e-commerce products must represent the true opinions of the reviewers and must capture the context in which the words were used to retain trust of users. To that end, we introduce the problem of extracting engaging excerpts from e-commerce product reviews in this paper. We present methods to automatically discover such excerpts from reviews at scale by leveraging natural language properties such as syntactic structure of sentences and sentiment, and discuss some of the underlying challenges. We further present an evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of the quality of the blurbs generated and their ranking orders produced.},

abstract = {The ability to automatically detect human stress and relaxation is crucial for timely diagnosing stress-related diseases, ensuring customer satisfaction in services and managing human-centric applications such as traffic management. Traditional methods employ stress-measuring scales or physiological monitoring which may be intrusive and inconvenient. Instead, the ubiquitous nature of the social media can be leveraged to identify stress and relaxation, since many people habitually share their recent life experiences through social networking sites. This paper introduces an improved method to detect expressions of stress and relaxation in social media content. It uses word sense disambiguation by word sense vectors to improve the performance of the first and only lexicon-based stress/relaxation detection algorithm TensiStrength. Experimental results show that incorporating word sense disambiguation substantially improves the performance of the original TensiStrength. It performs better than state-of-the-art machine learning methods too in terms of Pearson correlation and percentage of exact matches. We also propose a novel framework for identifying the causal agents of stress and relaxation in tweets as future work.},

abstract = {Breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and World Wide Web technologies have opened a new direction in Enterprise Intelligence, that is gradually transforming the way enterprises perform business and interact with their customers. This change is largely driven by the widespread consumer adoption of sophisticated AI technologies and web based social media. Consequently, almost all business enterprises face a number of challenges such as adoption of new business paradigms; customer centric business processes; issues with large, multi-modal, multilingual, and multicultural data, analyzing behavioral signals from social media; agility, security and many more. Therefore, the primary goal of this workshop is to bring together industry professionals and researchers working in the area of AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine-Learning, linguistics, social science, HCI, design and computer vision and those whose work concerns the intersection of these areas, together to provide a venue for the multidisciplinary discussion of how ubiquitous AI technologies can help in extracting social and enterprise intelligence for smart enterprise transformation while addressing the aforementioned challenges.},

abstract = {The AI methods are regaining a lot of attention in the areas of data analytics and decision support. Given the increasing amount of information and computational resources available, it is now possible for intelligent algorithms to learn from the data and assist humans more efficiently. Still, there is a question about the goals of learning and a form of the resulting data-driven knowledge. It is evident that humans do not operate with precise information in decision-making and, thus, it might be unnecessary to provide them with complete outcomes of analytical processes. Consequently, the next question arises whether approximate results of computations or results derived from the approximate data could be delivered more efficiently than their standard counterparts. Such questions are analogous to the ones about precision of calculations conducted by machine learning and KDD methods, whereby heuristic algorithms could be boosted by letting them rely on approximate computations. This leads us toward discussion of the importance of approximations in the areas of machine intelligence and business intelligence and, more broadly, the meaning of approximate derivations for various aspects of AI.

Then we use the adjusted sentiment analysis tool to report insights about the dynamics of emotion in on-line service chats, using a large data set of Telecommunication customer service interactions. Our analyses show customer emotions starting out negative and evolving into positive as the interaction ends. Also, we identify a close relationship between customer emotion dynamicsduring the service interaction and the concepts of service failure and recovery. This connection manifests in customer service quality evaluationsafter the interaction ends. Our study shows the connection between customer emotion and service quality as service interactions unfold, and suggests the use of sentiment analysis tools for real-time monitoring and control of web-based service quality.},

abstract = {Clustering narrow-domain short texts, such as academic abstracts, is an extremely difficult clustering problem. Firstly, short texts lead to low frequency and sparseness of words, making clustering results highly unstable and inaccurate; Secondly, narrow domain leads to great overlapping of insignificant words and makes it hard to distinguish between sub-domains, or fine-grained clusters. The vocabulary size is also too small to construct a good word bag needed by traditional clustering algorithms like LDA to give a meaningful topic distribution. A novel clustering model, Partitioned Word2Vec-LDA (PW-LDA), is proposed in this paper to tackle the described problems. Since the purpose sentences of an abstract contain crucial information about the topic of the paper, we firstly implement a novel algorithm to extract them from the abstracts according to its structural features. Then high-frequency words are removed from those purpose sentences to get a purified-purpose corpus and LDA and Word2Vec models are trained. After combining the results of both models, we can cluster the abstracts more precisely. Our model uses abstract text instead of keywords to cluster because keywords may be ambiguous and cause unsatisfied clustering results shown by previous work. Experimental results show that the clustering results of PW-LDA are much more accurate and stable than state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Payment transaction engine at PayU processes multimillion trans- actions every day through multiple payment gateways. Routing a transaction through an appropriate payment gateway is crucial to the engine for optimizing the availability and cost. The problem is that every transaction needs to choose one of K available payment gateways characterized by an unknown probability reward distri- bution. The reward for a gateway is a combination of its health and cost factors. The reward for a gateway is only realized when transaction is processed by the gateway i.e. by its success or failure. The objective of dynamic routing is to maximize the cumulative expected rewards over some given horizon of transactions' life. To do this, the dynamic switching system needs to acquire informa- tion about gateways (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards by selecting the best gateway at the moment (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade o is referred to as the regret. The main objective is to minimize the regret and maximize the rewards. The basic idea is to choose a gateway according to its probability of being the best gateway. The routing problem is a direct formulation of reinforcement learning (RL) problem. In an RL problem, an agent interacts with a dynamic, stochastic, and incompletely known environment, with the goal of finding an action-selection strategy, or policy, that optimizes some long-term performance measure. Thompson Sampling algorithm has experimentally been shown to be close to optimal.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of consumers using social media platforms to share both their satisfaction and displeasure about the products and services they use every day, organisations with a customer service focus are recognising the importance of rapid--and genuine--online engagement with their customers. In turn, consumers increasingly judge organisations on the quality of customer service and degree of responsiveness to online queries. This paper presents an extensible framework for evaluating direct engagements of customer service teams with customers on Twitter. Furthermore, this framework provides the capability to measure and analyse indirect engagement with industry sector rivals, especially their patterns, frequency and intensity. By applying graph analysis to these Twitter interactions, our framework generates various analytical measures and visual representations, exemplified through a case study based on seven major UK telecoms companies. With a dataset consisting of 15,000 tweets and 3,500 user profiles, the results provide sustained evidence for indirect engagements between business rivals, with customer queries acting as a trigger for intense competition between companies based in the same industry sub-domain.},

We place particular emphasis on ordinances and tweets relating to Smart City Characteristics (SCCs), since an important aim of our work is to assess how well a given region heads towards a Smart City. We rely on SCCs as a nexus between a seemingly infinite number of ordinances and tweets to be able to map them, and also to facilitate SCC-based opinion mining later for providing feedback to urban agencies based on public reactions. Common sense knowledge is harnessed in our approach to reflect human judgment in mapping. This paper presents our research in ordinance and tweet mapping with SCCs, including the proposed mapping approach, our initial experiments, related discussion, and future work emerging therein. To the best of our knowledge, ours is among the first works to conduct mining on ordinances and tweets for Smart Cities. This work has a broader impact with a vision to enhance Smart City growth.},

abstract = {For the temporal analysis of news articles or the extraction of temporal expressions from such documents, accurate document creation times are indispensable. While document creation times are available as time stamps or HTML metadata in many cases, depending on the document collection in question, this data can be inaccurate or incomplete in others. Especially in digitally published online news articles, publication times are often missing from the article or inaccurate due to (partial) updates of the content at a later time. In this paper, we investigate the prediction of document creation times for articles in citation networks of digitally published news articles, which provide a network structure of knowledge flows between individual articles in addition to the contained temporal expressions. We explore the evolution of such networks to motivate the extraction of suitable features, which we utilize in a subsequent prediction of document creation times, framed as a regression task. Based on our evaluation of several established machine learning regressors on a large network of English news articles, we show that the combination of temporal and local structural features allows for the estimation of document creation times from the network.},

abstract = {Predicting the popularity of a discussion topic in an online social network (OSN) or the responses to an online fund-raising campaign is a practical challenge of immense value. Previous work tries to predict the popularity of an online campaign by modeling information diffusion as a homogeneous temporal point process within a network of a single-type of actors. However, real-world information propagation often involved multiple types of actors. In particular, there are the so-called opinion leaders, e.g. online celebrities or influential OSN users with a huge number of followers, who can create a great impact on the visibility and thus the final popularity of an event by simply mentioning it in their tweets or postings. In this paper, we propose MASEP, a Multi-actor Self-exciting Process, to model and predict the popularity of different online campaigns involving multiple types of actors. MASEP combines a self-exciting branching process with a periodical decay process to capture the dynamics and interdependent relationship between opinion leaders and ordinary users during an online campaign. A closed-form expression is derived for the temporal campaign popularity under the MASEP model. Based on this closed-form expression, we can efficiently perform regression against the empirical activity measurements of an online campaign during its early stage to estimate the parameters of the corresponding MASEP model. The final popularity of the campaign can then be predicted. To demonstrate the efficacy of the MASEP-based approach, we apply it to predict the popularity of three types of online campaigns from different large-scale real-world datasets, namely, the total number of posts in retweeting cascades, the overall count of individual hashtags in posting streams, and the final number of sponsors for crowd-funding campaigns. In particular, using the initial 30% of each campaign data trace for training, our approach can achieve absolute prediction error (APE) of 13.25%, 15.7%, and 36.9% respectively for datasets of 3 different types of campaigns. This corresponds to a 26.1% to 63.2% reduction in prediction error when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches including SEISMIC, SpikeM, and STRM.},

abstract = {The development of information retrieval algorithms and temporal information retrieval ones has been extensively carried out over the last few years. While several studies have been conducted, most of these researches relate to English, leading to a lack of knowledge in several other important languages. This includes the Persian one. In this work, we aim to shorten this gap by contributing, disseminating and enlarging the knowledge we have on temporal information retrieval aspects in Persian, which is one of the dominant languages in the Middle East, widely spoken in several countries. To achieve this objective, we propose to understand the use of temporal expressions on a large-scale Persian search engine query log consisting of 27M queries. In particular, we focus on explicit (e.g., June 2017) and relative temporal expressions (e.g., tomorrow) and try to understand (1) how often temporal expressions are used in web queries; (2) which type of temporal expressions (Date, Time, Duration and Set) are commonly used; (3) to which time (past, current or future) do temporal expressions mostly refer to; (4) to which category they often belong; (5) how often do user's reformulate their queries by adding temporal expressions; and (6) how using temporal expressions affects user's satisfaction. We believe that answering these questions may be beneficial for a large number of tasks including, user's behavior understanding and search engines' improvement effectiveness.},

abstract = {The emergence of open information extraction as a tool for constructing and expanding knowledge graphs has aided the growth of temporal data, for instance, YAGO, NELL and Wikidata. While YAGO and Wikidata maintain the valid time of facts, NELL records the time point at which a fact is retrieved from some Web corpora. Collectively, these knowledge graphs (KGs) store facts extracted from Wikipedia and other sources. Due to the imprecise nature of the extraction tools that are used to build and expand KGs, such as NELL, the facts in the KGs are weighted (a confidence value representing the correctness of a fact). Additionally, NELL can be considered as a transaction time KG because every fact is associated with extraction date. On the other hand, YAGO and Wikidata use the valid time model because they only maintain facts together with their validity time (temporal scope). In this paper, we propose a bitemporal model (that combines transaction and valid time models) for maintaining and querying probabilistic temporal knowledge graphs. We report our evaluation results of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Web searches are done by users every day on a million-daily basis. Many of these web searches are related to events, social occasions that attracts society's attention. Events may happen multiple times on cyclic or non-periodic occasions. These are known as spiky events. When these events occur, multiple spikes can be observed in query logs triggered by a change in the user's behaviour and an increase in the frequency of the user's queries. In this paper, we aim to understand the user's search behaviour towards this kind of events. To this regard, we propose a new taxonomy of spiky events which categorizes queries into two groups: periodic (ongoing, historical, traditional) and aperiodic (predictable and unpredictable), and study how various features concerning the query and the clicked web pages describe the user's behaviour, before, during, and after the event. To conduct this research, we consider 100 spiky events and rely on a two-year Persian search engine query log to analyse their related queries and associated information. The results obtained show that users have a different behaviour regarding the query frequency, length and temporality, depending on the category of the spiky event and that query formulation and clicked pages are also different for each category before, during and after the event. Understanding these user's behaviours and their relationship with the different categories may play an important role for any search engine looking to provide better services for their users.},

We consider temporal KGs, in which edges are further annotated with time intervals, reflecting when the relationship between entities held in time. In this paper, we focus on the task of predicting time validity for unannotated edges. We introduce the problem as a variation of relational embedding. We adapt existing approaches, and explore the importance example selection and the incorporation of side information in the learning process. We present our experimental evaluation in details.},

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the organizing committee and with the experience of successful workshops in 2015, 2016, and 2017, we aim to continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that coordinates Wikimedia projects and the researchers interested in studying them. We received 17 paper submissions (and counting) from all around the world covering a broad range of topics. Our program committee evaluated them regarding relevance, quality, and novelty, selecting 8 to be presented as posters and published in the workshop proceedings, and numerous others for poster presentation only.},

abstract = {Quality in Wikipedia is enforced through a set of editing policies and guidelines recommended for Wikipedia editors. Neutral point of view (NPOV) is one of the main principles in Wikipedia, which ensures that for controversial information all possible points of view are represented proportionally. Furthermore, language used in Wikipedia should be neutral and not opinionated. However, due to the large number of Wikipedia articles and its operating principle based on a voluntary basis of Wikipedia editors; quality assurances and Wikipedia guidelines cannot always be enforced. Currently, there are more than 40,000 articles, which are flagged with NPOV or similar quality tags. Furthermore, these represent only the portion of articles for which such quality issues are explicitly flagged by the Wikipedia editors, however, the real number may be higher considering that only a small percentage of articles are of good quality or featured as categorized by Wikipedia. In this work, we focus on the case of language bias at the sentence level in Wikipedia. Language bias is a hard problem, as it represents a subjective task and usually the linguistic cues are subtle and can be determined only through its context. We propose a supervised classification approach, which relies on an automatically created lexicon of bias words, and other syntactical and semantic characteristics of biased statements. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a dataset consisting of biased and unbiased statements, and show that we are able to detect biased statements with an accuracy of 74%. Furthermore, we show that competitors that determine bias words are not suitable for detecting biased statements, which we outperform with a relative improvement of over 20%.},

abstract = {The collaborative knowledge base Wikidata is the central storage of Wikimedia projects, containing over 45 million data items. It acts as the hub for interlinking Wikipedia pages about a specific item in different languages, automates features such as infoboxes in Wikipedia, and is increasingly used for other applications such as data enrichment and question answering. Tracking the quality of Wikidata is an important issue for this project. In this paper we focus particularly on the completeness aspect. Several automated techniques have been adopted by Wikis to track and manage completeness, yet these techniques are generally subjective and do not provide a clear quality estimate at the level of entities. In this paper, we present an approach towards measuring Relative Completeness in Wikidata by comparison with data present for similar entities. This relative completeness approach is easily scalable with the introduction of new classes in the knowledge base, and has been implemented for all available entities in Wikidata. The results provide an intuition on the completeness of an entity comparing it with other similar entities. Here, we present our implementation approach along with a discussion on strategies and open challenges.},

abstract = {Wikipedia is one of the top visited resources on the Web, furthermore, it is used extensively as the main source of information for applications like Web search, question &amp; answering etc. This is mostly attributed to Wikipedia's coverage in terms of topics and real-world entities and the fact that Wikipedia articles are constantly updated with new and emerging facts. However, only a small fraction of articles are considered to be of good quality. The large majority of articles are incomplete and have other quality issues. A strong quality indicator is the presence of external references from third-party sources (e.g. news sources) as suggested by the verifiability principle in Wikipedia. Even for the existing references in Wikipedia there is an inherent lag in terms of the publication time of cited resources and the time they are cited in Wikipedia articles. We propose a near real-time suggestion of news references for Wikipedia from a daily news stream. We model daily news into specific events, spanning from a day up to year. Thus, we construct an event-chain from which we determine when the information in an event has converged and consequentially based on a learning-to-rank approach suggest the most authoritative and complete news article to Wikipedia articles involved in a specific event. We evaluate our news suggestion approach on a set of 41 events extracted from Wikipedia currents event portal, and on new corpus consisting of daily news between the period of 2016-2017 with more than 14 million news articles. We are able to suggest news articles to Wikipedia pages with an overall accuracy of MAP=0.77 and with a minimal lag w.r.t the publication time of the news article.},

abstract = {Despite its importance to the Web, multimedia content is often neglected when building and designing knowledge-bases: though descriptive metadata and links are often provided for images, video, etc., the multimedia content itself is often treated as opaque and is rarely analysed. IMGpedia is an effort to bring together the images of Wikimedia Commons (including visual information), and relevant knowledge-bases such as Wikidata and DBpedia. The result is a knowledge-base that incorporates similarity relations between the images based on visual descriptors, as well as links to the resources of Wikidata and DBpedia that relate to the image. Using the IMGpedia SPARQL endpoint, it is then possible to perform visuo-semantic queries, combining the semantic facts extracted from the external resources and the similarity relations of the images. This paper presents a new web interface to browse and explore the dataset of IMGpedia in a more friendly manner, as well as new visuo-semantic queries that can be answered using 6 million recently added links from IMGpedia to Wikidata. We also discuss future directions we foresee for the IMGpedia project.},

abstract = {Info-boxes provide a summary of the most important meta-data relating to a particular entity described by a Wikipedia article. However, many articles have no info-box or have info-boxes with only minimal information; furthermore, there is a huge disparity between the level of detail available for info-boxes in English articles and those for other languages. Wikidata has been proposed as a central repository of facts to try to address such disparities, and has been used as a source of information to generate info-boxes. However, current processes still rely on human intervention either to create generic templates for entities of a given type or to create a specific info-box for a specific article in a specific language. As such, there are still many articles of Wikipedia without info-boxes but where relevant data are provided by Wikidata. In this paper, we investigate fully automatic methods to generate info-boxes for Wikipedia from the Wikidata knowledge graph. The primary challenge is to create ranking mechanisms that provide an intuitive prioritisation of the facts associated with an entity. We discuss this challenge, propose several straightforward metrics to prioritise information in info-boxes, and present an initial user evaluation to compare the quality of info-boxes generated by various metrics.},

Real-time feedback about the user's heart rate and heart rate training zones is given through a web application. The performance and scalability of the platform is evaluated on a Raspberry Pi.

abstract = {For smart decision making, user agents need live and historic access to open data from sensors installed in the public domain. In contrast to a closed environment, for Open Data and federated query processing algorithms, the data publisher cannot anticipate in advance on specific questions, nor can it deal with a bad cost-efficiency of the server interface when data consumers increase. When publishing observations from sensors, different fragmentation strategies can be thought of depending on how the historic data needs to be queried. Furthermore, both publish/subscribe and polling strategies exist to publish live updates. Each of these strategies come with their own trade-offs regarding cost-efficiency of the server-interface, user-perceived performance and cpu use. A polling strategy where multiple observations are published in a paged collection was tested in a proof of concept for parking spaces availability. In order to understand the different resource trade-offs presented by publish/subscribe and polling publication strategies, we devised an experiment on two machines, for a scalability test. The preliminary results were inconclusive and suggest more large scale tests are needed in order to see a trend. While the large-scale tests will be performed in future work, the proof of concept helped to identify the technical Open Data principles for the 13 biggest cities in Flanders.},

abstract = {The join operator is a core component of an RDF Stream Processing engine. The join operations usually dominate the processing load of a query execution plan. Due to the constantly updating nature of continuous queries, the query optimiser has to frequently change the optimal execution plan for a query. However, optimising the join executing plan for every execution step might be prohibitively expensive, hence, dynamic optimisation of continuous join operations is still a challenging problem so far. Therefore, this paper proposes the first adaptive optimisation approach towards this problem in the context of RDF Stream Processing. The approach comes with two dynamic cost-based optimisation algorithms which use a light-weight process to search for the best execution plan for every execution step. The experiments show the encouraging results towards this direction.},

First held in 2010 at WWW in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, this 2018 edition of the WS-REST Workshop Series is proud to be a part of the renowned WWW conference series in Lyon, France. WS-REST 2018 brings together a community of researcher and practitioners interested in Web APIs and service architecture. Bringing Research and Industry Together In keeping with the history of WS-REST events, the 2018 edition strives to bring together vital content from both the Web Services and REST communities. This year we are hosting two individual tracks (Research and Industry) as a way to continue and strengthen this collaboration between academic and applied experience. The research track submissions received careful peer-review and will be published in the Web Conference proceedings. Industry track submissions focus on field-tested examples and use-cases in the form of extended abstracts or position papers and were selected by the organizers with advice from select program committee members. APIs, Services, and REST APIs have become the connective fabric of the Web and any application area that uses Internet or Web technologies. The goal of WS-REST 2018 is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners where they can openly and freely exchange ideas about how they are using Web technologies in their APIs, what works and what does not work for them, and what challenges they see in the current landscape of standards and technologies.

This is why industry specialists usually suggest "driven by" development approaches to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose such a methodology that employs Specification Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development in order to facilitate the phases of Web Service requirements elicitation and specification. Furthermore, we introduce gherkin2OAS, a software tool that aspires to bridge the aforementioned development approaches. Through the suggested methodology and tool, one may design and build RESTful services fast, while ensuring proper functionality.},

abstract = {Representational State Transfer (REST) is an efficient and by now established architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. However, REST has not been designed for offline operations, yet many applications must also keep functioning when going offline for more than a few seconds. Burdening the programmer with knowledge about offline status is undesirable. RESTful applications can be described by a formal model. Therefore, we define a function to derive a formal model of the proxy for handling offline support on the client-side. We then extend existing caching approaches so that a client-side proxy can transparently hide the offline status from the application. We validate our solution with a proxy layer that covers all test cases derived from the model. Using our model and proxy, clients do not have to know and worry about whether they are online or offline.},

abstract = {Being an architectural style rather than a specification or a standard, the proper design of REpresentational State Transfer (REST) APIs is not trivial, since developers have to deal with a flood of recommendations and best practices, especially the proper application of the hypermedia constraint requires some decent experience. Furthermore, testing RESTful APIs is a missing topic within literature and especially, hypermedia testing is not mentioned at all. To deal with this state of affairs, we have elaborated a Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) approach for creating RESTful APIs. As this project matured, we also explored the possibility of Model-Driven Testing (MDT). This work addresses the challenges of hypermedia testing and proposes approaches to overcome them with MDT techniques. We present the results of hypermedia testing for RESTful APIs using a model verification approach that were discovered within our research. MDT enables the verification of the underlying model of a RESTful API and ensuring its correctness before initiating any code generation. Therefore, we can prevent a poorly designed model from being transformed into a poorly designed RESTful API.},

abstract = {A central vision of the Internet of Things is the representation of the physical world in a consistent virtual environment. Especially in the context of smart factories the connection of the different, heterogeneous production modules through a digital shop floor promises faster conversion rates, data-driven maintenance or automated machine configurations for use cases which haven't been recognized at design time. Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.},

abstract = {In this talk, I will present Merged-Averaged Classifiers via Hashing (MACH) for K-classification with ultra-large values of K. Compared to traditional one-vs-all classifiers that require $O(Kd)$ memory and inference cost, MACH only need $O(d\l{}ogK)$ (d is dimensionality) memory while only requiring $O(K\l{}ogK + d\l{}ogK )$ operation for inference. MACH is a generic K-classification algorithm, with provably theoretical guarantees, without any assumption on the relationship between classes. MACH uses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes to few (logarithmic many) independent classification tasks with small (constant) number of classes. I will show the first quantification of discriminability-memory tradeoff in multi-class classification. Using the simple idea of hashing, we can train ODP dataset with 100,000 classes and 400,000 features on a single Titan X GPU, with the classification accuracy of 19.28%, which is the best-reported accuracy on this dataset. Before this work, the best performing baseline is a one-vs-all classifier that requires 40 billion parameters (160 GB model size) and achieves 9% accuracy. In contrast, MACH can achieve 9% accuracy with 480x reduction in the model size (of mere 0.3GB). With MACH, we also demonstrate complete training of feature extracted fine-grained imagenet dataset (compressed size 104GB), with 21,000 classes, on a single GPU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate complete training of these extreme-class datasets on a single Titan X. Furthermore, the algorithm is trivially parallelizable. Our experiments show that we can train ODP datasets in 7 hours on a single GPU or in 15 minutes with 25 GPUs. Similarly, we can train classifiers over the fine-grained imagenet dataset in 24 hours on a single GPU which can be reduced to little over 1 hour with 20 GPUs.},

abstract = {Structured prediction, where outcomes have a precedence order, lies at the heart of machine learning for information retrieval, movie recommendation, product review prediction, and digital advertising. Ordinal ranking, in particular, assumes that the structured response has a linear ranked order. Due to the extensive applicability of these models, substantial research has been devoted to understanding them, as well as developing efficient training techniques. One popular and widely cited technique of training ordinal ranking models is to exploit the linear precedence order and systematically reduce it to a binary classification problem. This facilitates the usage of readily available, powerful binary classifiers, but necessitates an expansion of the original training data, where the training data increases by $K-1$ times of its original size, with K being the number of ordinal classes. Due to prevalent nature of problems with large number of ordered classes, the reduction leads to datasets which are too large to train on single machines. While approximation methods like stochastic gradient descent are typically applied here, we investigate exact optimization solutions that can scale. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer (DC) algorithm, which divides large scale binary classification data into a cluster of machines and trains logistic models in parallel, and combines them at the end of the training phase to create a single binary classifier, which can then be used as an ordinal ranker. It requires no synchronization between the parallel learning algorithms during the training period, which makes training on large datasets feasible and efficient. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality property of the learned models using our proposed algorithm. We provide empirical evidence, on various ordinal datasets, of improved estimation and prediction performance of the model learnt using our algorithm, over several standard divide-and-conquer algorithms.},

Importantly, traditional recommender systems, based on collaborative filtering, are not capable of handlingnever-seen-before items (threads). We can view this task as a form of Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMLC), where for a newly-posted thread, we predict the set of users (labels) who will want to respond to it. Selecting a subset of users from the set of all users in the community poses significant challenges due to scalability, and sparsity. We propose a neural network architecture to solve thisnew thread recommendation task. Our architecture uses stacked bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for text encoding along with cluster sensitive attention for exploiting correlations among the large label space. Experimental evaluation with four datasets from different domains show that our model outperforms both the state-of-the-art recommendation systems as well as other XMLC approaches for this task in terms of MRR, Recall, and NDCG.},

The topics addressed varied from being purely focused on a domain specific task, without constraints on the technical approach to take (e.g. music genre recognition) to fundamentally technical tasks, which can be seen as useful across domains (question answering), with two of the challenges representing a mix of both.},

Artist labels are less subjective and less noisy, while certain artists may relate more strongly to certain genres. At the same time, at prediction time, it is not guaranteed that artist labels are available for a given audio segment. Therefore, in this work, we propose to apply the transfer learning framework, learning artist-related information which will be used at inference time for genre classification. We consider different types of artist-related information, expressed through artist group factors, which will allow for more efficient learning and stronger robustness to potential label noise. Furthermore, we investigate how to achieve the highest validation accuracy on the given FMA dataset, by experimenting with various kinds of transfer methods, including single-task transfer, multi-task transfer and finally multi-task learning.},

There are two subtasks : (1) to predict continuous sentiment score between -1 to 1, and (2) to determine which aspect(s) are related to the content of financial tweets. First, we propose a preprocessing procedure for decomposing financial tweets. Second, we collect over 334K labeled financial tweets to enlarge the scale of the experiments. Third, the sentiment prediction task is separated into two steps in this paper, i.e., (1) bullish/bearish and (2) sentiment degree. We compare the results of the CNN, CRNN and Bi-LSTM models. Besides, we further combine the results of the best models in both steps as the model of subtask 1. Finally, we make an investigation of aspects in depth, and propose some clues for dealing with the 14 aspects.},

abstract = {Aspect-based financial sentiment analysis, which aims to classify the text instance into a pre-defined aspect class and predict the sentiment score for the mentioned target. In this paper, we propose a neural network model, Attention-based LSTM model with the Aspect information (ALA), to solve the financial opinion mining problem introduced by the WWW 2018 shared task. The proposed neural network model can adapt to the financial dataset so that the neural network can effectively understand the semantic information of the short text. We evaluate our model with the 10-fold cross-validation, and we compare our model with a variety of related deep neural network models.},

abstract = {The goal of question answering with financial data is selecting sentences as answers from the given documents for a question. The core of the task is computing the similarity score between the question and answer pairs. In this paper, we incorporate statistical features such as the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and the word overlap in convolutional neural networks to learn optimal vector representations of question-answering pairs. The proposed model does not depend on any external resources and can be easily extended to other domains. Our experiments show that the TF-IDF and the word overlap features can improve the performance of basic neural network models. Also, with our experimental results, we can prove that models based on the margin loss training achieve better performance than the traditional classification models. When the number of candidate answers for each question is 500, our proposed model can achieve 0.622 in Top-1 accuracy (Top-1), 0.654 in mean average precision (MAP), 0.767 in normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), and 0.701 in bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU). If the number of candidate answers is 30, all the values of the evaluation metrics can reach more than 90%.},

abstract = {Aspect based sentiment analysis aims to detect an aspect (i.e. features) in a given text and then perform sentiment analysis of the text with respect to that aspect. This paper aims to give a solution for the FiQA 2018 challenge subtask 1. We perform aspect-based sentiment analysis on the microblogs and headlines of financial domain. We use a multi-channel convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis and a recurrent neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory units to extract aspect from a given headline or microblog. Our proposed model produces a weighted average F1 score of 0.69 for the aspect extraction task and predicts sentiment intensity scores with a mean squared error of 0.112 on 10-fold cross validation. We believe that the developed system has direct applications in the financial domain.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our ensemble approach for sentiment and aspect predictions in the financial domain for a given text. This ensemble approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a ridge regression and a voting strategy for sentiment and aspect predictions, and therefore, does not rely on any handcrafted feature. Based on 5-cross validation on the released training set, the results show that CNNs overall perform better than RNNs on both tasks, and the ensemble approach can boost the performance further by leveraging different types of deep learning approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a neural network based framework for answering non-factoid questions. The framework consists of two main components: Answer Retriever and Answer Ranker. In the first component, we leverage off-the-shelf retrieval models (e.g. bm25) to retrieve a pool of candidate answers regarding to the input question. Answer Ranker is then used to select the most suitable answer. In this work, we adopt two typical deep learning based frameworks for our Answer Ranker component. One is based on Siamese architecture and the other is the Compare-Aggregate framework. The Answer Ranker component is evaluated separately based on popular answer selection datasets. Our overall system is evaluated using FiQA dataset, a newly released dataset for financial domain and shows promising results.},
