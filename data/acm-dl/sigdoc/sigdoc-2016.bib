abstract = {The primary research question in this paper revolved around the logistics and feasibility of using iPad to perform the processes related to 3D scanning, design and technical documentation for task-based English language learning in a non-native classroom environment. The project discussed the use of IPads to scan a physical object using iSense scanners, use CAD software apps to innovate on the design, upload it in Cubify design feed repository, perform rapid prototyping, and then send it off to the Cubify 3D printer. During this entire process, students are expected to use Google Drive app to write design specifications and short technical reports, use concept-mapping app to draw product design blueprints, and illustrate idea sketches for usability studies using the iPad. We used a pilot study and experiment to analyze the feasibility and logistics of the proposed course design. Preliminary observations from this pilot study suggested that iPads could be used effectively and seamlessly to integrate the technology and the technical documentation processes. This pedagogical model is likely to help us teach innovative technical communication courses.},

Through surveys and qualitative interviews of 21 international college students, narrative data were collected and analyzed with a modified grounded theory methodology. This paper reports the preliminary findings from this study, including themes that indicate mismatch between designed features and user expectation due to sociocultural differences. Key distinctions involving cross-cultural literacy practices and technology expectations are discussed. Accordingly, I argue for a reenactment of a sociotechnological agenda as a culturally sensitive model for the research and design of wearables and emerging technologies.},

abstract = {While physical study abroad and exchange programs are proven methods for building cross-cultural communication, there are many limitations on the number of people who get to participate and how accessible such programs are to diverse populations. To address such inequities of access and consider virtual alternatives and supplements to traditional study abroad programs, a team of faculty and students collaborated on making a game designed to facilitate both English-language learning and cross-cultural communication through providing a virtual version of a trip to the United States. This paper discusses the historical context enabling such a project to occur and then discusses the process of building and deploying a game designed by US students for a Russian audience of visually-impaired students at the Grot School in St. Petersburg, Russia. The resulting text- and audio-based game demonstrates the potential of situated user-centered game design as a pedagogical practice with learning outcomes both for the student creators and the audience of student players. The resulting game was requested by 11 other institutions. The results reported here highlight the ability of game based learning to facilitate cross cultural communication, develop mutual understandings, and build relationships between culturally diverse students on an interpersonal level. It further reveals how the use of open source game creating tools provide a customizable game platform for the development of ideas to improve intercultural competence in the context of language learning (such as EFL) when other resources are not readily available. The impact of this type of initiative is thus far greater than the created object (the game): it illustrates the strong potential of games and game-making as a method for advancing cultural discourse, an important prerequisite for effective intercultural communication and documentation.},

abstract = {The design of technology occurs in a rich, nuanced and complex rhetorical space. Technical teams engage in negotiations, and at times argue, about design. We claim that user experience (UX) practice, at its heart, is a rhetorical endeavor, and this aspect of UX practice has been underexplored. To bridge the gap between UX theory and practice, we pose the research question: What strategies and tactics do UX practitioners use to convince or persuade others about design? To answer this question, we interviewed experienced UX practitioners and present the results of these interviews as a taxonomy of rhetorical strategies situated by an awareness of rhetorical complexity and the impact of context. The results of the study demonstrate that normative UX methods and practices discussed in the literature are chosen, adapted or dismissed as savvy rhetors flex their metis.},

abstract = {In a remote, unmoderated experiment, we tested readers' performance and perceptions as they used web-based documents to perform information-seeking tasks. The high value of specific participant experiences motivated us to develop a low-overhead tool to collect specific information remotely about readers' experiences with web-based documents. The tool we developed overlays a web document and prompts readers with a specific request to which they respond by highlighting a location in the document. In our experiment, we found the interaction to be very clear and easy for readers of a web site to use. The tool required very low communication bandwidth and processing power to collect and analyze the data and produced easy to interpret response visualizations and statistical analyses. This paper describes our experience with the tool in the course of the experiment. Further, we propose broader applications of the tool to support research activities in other document genres and, to adapt it for professional use in content management systems and web publishing platforms.},

abstract = {Divides among academic knowledge and practitioner needs have been well documented in technical communication and related fields. However, the recent popularity of practitioner publications indicates a timely moment to reassess the relationships among academic and nonacademic influencers in emerging communication design knowledge. In this paper, we introduce initial findings from the first phase of an ongoing research project that analyzes citation practices in communication design publications. First, we created a sample of over 1500 citations from 30 recent peer-reviewed journal articles that treat emerging communication design themes. Next, we coded authors or author teams from the 30 original articles and the 1500 cited publications to identify whether each author or author team was comprised of academic research faculty, nonacademics, or both. Based on this analysis, we show that academic citations comprise just over 60 percent of the total number in our sample. While this is a clear majority, non-academic citations do frequently influence the shape of peer-reviewed work on emerging communication design themes. Based on our findings, we argue for extending citation analysis to a larger sample of peer-reviewed journal articles and different publications types (i.e., proceedings, books, trade magazines, blogs, social media conversations) in order to test our findings. We furthermore call for social network analysis (SNA) that can reveal more complex interconnections among academic researchers and industry or independent thought leaders around topics such as user experience, content management and strategy, and project management.},

To do this we analyzed Amazon.com consumer electronic product customer reviews to reevaluate a central concept in North American Genre Theory: stable genre structures arise from recurring social actions ([1][2][3][4][5]). We discovered evidence of genre hybridity in the signals of instructional genres embedded into customer reviews. Our paper discusses the creation of a prototype web application, "Use What You Choose" (UWYC), which sorts the natural language text of Amazon reviews into two categories: instructionally-weighed reviews (e.g., reviews that contain operational information about products) and non-instructionally-weighed reviews (those that evaluate the quality of the product). Our results contribute to rhetorical genre theory and offer ideas on applying genre theory to inform application design for users of information services.},

abstract = {Recent advances in technology fostered the commercialization and usage of wearable devices. Among diverse form factors, wrist worn devices stand out. Benefitting from a conventional format and easy access, wrist worn devices, such as smart watches and fitness trackers, have been gaining popularity. While their continuous usage and close contact with the human body enable various applications, their limited computational resources summed with continuous changes in the context of use challenge designers in providing effective interactive solutions for end users. Seeking to understand how the context of use impacts the user experience and interaction with ten popular wrist worn wearables, in this study we analyzed the users' feedback: 545 users' comments were collected from Amazon, coded and aggregated. Based on the users' feedback, we identify 31 major problems that are currently faced in wrist worn interfaces. The analyses of the users' feedback led to a discussion about the causes and severity of those problems, and also to the definition of a set of design implications aimed at improving the user interaction with the next-generation wrist worn wearables.},

The results of the second step are used along with the usability inspection results to calculate the usability index that was set out aiming to measuring and comparing the relative usability of competing products. After the inspection, the usability index was calculated, which allowed us to verify the usability degree of the applications that had been developed using two different methodologies.},

abstract = {This technical report addresses questions raised by technical communication scholars concerning who or what may have rhetorical agency [1] in technology tools used to organize and manage information. One such tool is Google Analytics, a self-contained third-party system that technical communicators deploy by adding tracking code to web pages. Data collected through Google's algorithms are processed and presented through the Analytics reporting tool. Customizable reports are managed by the Analytics account administrator and shared with web developers, designers, and writers to assess rhetorical value, defined as whether the page reached its audience and achieved its communicative purpose. The data are also frequently shared with administrators, supervisors, and data technicians to demonstrate ongoing value of website work and technical communicator labor. Report data, in the form of metrics and customizable visual interfaces, not only visualize the rhetorical value of web pages, but also represent Google's rhetorical agency as designer and presenter of metrics. The paper encourages technical communicators to do symbolic-analytic work [34] to contextualize and remediate report data in their organizations. It reframes Analytics reports as "network exchanges" [29] in which responses, not resolution, are the goal of the Analytics report's rhetorical work. In this way, Google Analytics reports generate responses, rather than results, where technical communicators become part of the rhetorical network exchange and articulate Analytics data for stakeholders seeking website user and visit metrics.},

I then examine the animation types (e.g., rotation and fading) used by a specific mobile application. By comparing current practices to previous research, I argue that decades-old design principles can be used to understand and clarify the frequent injunction to design animation that is "realistic" and/or "lively." I also call attention to emerging terms and concepts that are not covered by prior research, providing possible threads for future study.},

abstract = {The role of small and medium enterprises (SME), especially small businesses, has significantly increased in the developing of interactive applications. Given the relevance of these companies in the market, the adoption of usability and user experience (UX) practices in these organizations is fundamental for the improvement of interactive systems. This paper performed a survey with 26 Brazilian small businesses of software about their Usability and UX practices. The results showed that Usability Tests and Heuristic Evaluation were the evaluation methods most frequently reported to be used by the surveyed companies. Although the results suggest an improvement in the adoption of usability and UX practices, they also show the need for significant improvement in training and awareness of the importance of usability and UX and appropriating techniques and practices in the context of small businesses. Our results showed a low use of accessibility evaluation methods, such as tests with disabled users (no mention) or even the use of automated tools to check initial aspects of accessibility (mentioned by only 3.85% of respondents) by the companies surveyed. It also showed that the companies surveyed relies many times on professionals of low experience for the conduction of Usability Tests and Heuristic Evaluation.},

Heuristic Evaluation is a popular method of usability evaluation, and its applicability to inspect the mobile usability may be improved by the development of context and audience specific heuristics. Additionally to a previous mapping, we present analysis of the recent usage of context and audience specific heuristics, and the application of Heuristic Evaluation to evaluate multiple contexts and audiences. The results showed the use of specific heuristics for the Healthy context and Malaysian audience. In addition, the results turned out the evolving of Heuristic Evaluation for multiple contexts and audiences, such as: Health Sector, Games, Learning, Elderly and Accessibility.},

abstract = {Based on participant observation conducted for a total of 85 hours spread across two months, this paper investigates the different types of information maintenance technicians seek, and discusses which of those types are relevant and challenging for a technical communicator to design. In order to design useful technical information, the technical communicator must not only understand the information needs of a user, but also understand the various aspects of the user context. This paper highlights a gap that exists between the type of information maintenance technicians seek, and what is relevant for a technical communicator to design. Information about the construction of a machine and work task instructions are relevant for a technical communicator to design. However, information regarding business identities and numbers, the cause of errors, placement of equipment and tools, as well as information related to various aspects of task execution seem very challenging--- or even impossible--- for a technical communicator to design during product development. This paper contributes knowledge to user behavior research within the technical communication research field. The results provide technical communicators with an understanding of what type of information maintenance technicians seek and select in order to satisfy an expressed information need. This discussion enables technical communication practitioners and researchers to gain a better understanding of what type of information is relevant to design and which information is a challenge to design, thus which types of expressed information needs are suitable to focus on, and why.},

abstract = {Technological changes bring great efficiencies and opportunities; however, they also bring new threats and dangers that users are often ill prepared to handle. Some individuals have training at work or school while others have family or friends to help them. However, there are few widely known or ubiquitous educational programs to inform and motivate users to develop safe cybersecurity practices. Additionally, little is known about learning strategies in this domain. Understanding how active Internet users have learned their security practices can give insight into more effective learning methods. I surveyed 800 online labor workers to discover their learning processes. They shared how they had to construct their own schema and negotiate meaning in a complex domain. Findings suggest a need to help users build a dynamic mental model of security. Participants recommend encouraging participatory and constructive learning, multi-model dissemination, and ubiquitous opportunities for learning security behaviors.},

The case study (planning, conduction and evaluation) was carried out based on the Communicability Evaluation Method (CEM) guidelines that support the identification and classification of application-to-users communicability breaks. The findings revealed us that there is no difference in the application communicability for both - deaf and hearing. In the conclusion we outlined some reflections about the need of proposing guidelines to building mobile applications for deaf people.},

We apply these methodologies to our own experiences as community based researchers, and sketch an adaptable heuristic for thinking through messy problems that researchers inhabiting similarity positionality might leverage in order to consider the ethical challenges of researcher positionality. Research positionality often carries tacit consequences for 1) researchers' immediate and enduring relationships with individuals and institutions, 2) researchers' ethics, 3) researchers' professional disciplines, and 4) the larger communities researchers seek to improve as citizens and end-users. This report argues that the positionality of researchers who also identify as stakeholders within the institutions and communities at study has been underappreciated and poses ethical and methodological challenges that warrant exploration.},

abstract = {In higher education institutions, writing in the disciplines (WID) and writing across the curriculum (WAC) programs are commonly received reluctantly by other disciplines and programs (Perelman). The context for these programs - servicing schools and departments but remaining apart from them - creates problems for facilitating effective service. At the University of Nevada, Reno, a new program began in 2015, called Composition and Communication in the Disciplines (CCID) and focusing on building student writing, presenting, and multimodal communication. To counter disciplinary reticence about such programs, CCID uses design thinking at its relational heuristic. In this context, design thinking serves as a means to engage with diverse disciplines and modes of communication active on campus while avoiding the perception of imposed disciplinarity. Although a number of scholars have written about the parallels between design and writing (Purdy; Norman), design thinking has yet to be used as part of a writing program in this way.This panel presentation includes a short overview of CCID, followed by details of how and why this design thinking-based, multimodal communication program is developing. Hepworth will focus on how design thinking is used to teach the building of effective multimodal student presentations. Mays will focus on how design thinking can be used to enrich writing, encouraging students to see it as active engagement with dynamic audiences. Macauley will discuss design thinking as an opportunity to improve student agency and self-efficacy as communicators.},

abstract = {This study is an analysis of seven obstetric websites. Through rhetorical theory and the framework of presence and absence, I demonstrate that by limiting the audience to expectant mothers and not including fathers, these websites do little to inform fathers who are physically and emotionally a part of the birth experience. Furthermore, the absence of fathers as audience promotes outdated gender roles and demonstrates that these websites have failed to evolve in a modern context. By the end of this presentation, conference participants will see how rhetorical theory serves to reveal gaps on hospital websites. These gaps mean only one side of a birthing narrative is communicated to expectant couples. Conference participants will see the benefits of analyzing audience and including a complete or universal audience when designing online communication.},

The Admissions Office recently revised their content strategy to create a consistent message across multiple channels and platforms. This study examined the core strategy, content (substance and structure), and work practices (workflow and governance). After analysis, the content substance was determined to follow six themes based on the university identity. The content structure followed an anti-single-sourcing strategy, showcasing variety in images across platforms and channels, rather than repetition. The strategy also used genre sets for different audiences. For workflow, there was a lead responsible for each channel. Governance followed the university hierarchy for decision-making. The content lifecycle followed the admission cycle of prospective, applicant, admitted, and yield over the academic year.},

After coding the comments made by editors on these grant proposals according to a 82-item coding scheme, I found that editors most often give suggestions, directions, explications, explanations, or have questions related to Content (77%), then Grammar and Mechanics (14%), then Design (4%), then Style (2%), and then Punctuation (1%). Overall, there were 471 times that codes were applied to the issues that editors addressed in their comments.The editors' emphasis on content in this study, especially in development and improving clarity, is consistent with the anecdotal, how-to advice from authors that promote improving clarity, conciseness, and accuracy, whether developing or deleting to improve these issues [1]; attending to audience [2, 3]; using active voice [4]; or encouraging organization [5, 6, 7]. Previous research also suggests avoiding jargon or technical terms [8, 9], which is reflected in the findings of this study in the Grammar and Mechanics category, in which editors address choosing an alternate or more accurate word or phrase.This research contributes to the evidence-based literature on grant proposal writing as well as editing, especially the types and phrasing of editing comments.},

abstract = {This paper describes the process we undertook to address a significant technical communication issue embedded within traditional information-distribution procedures in the U.S. National Park Service: The bureau's nationally circulated brochures, as print artifacts, are inaccessible to people who are blind, visually impaired and print dyslexic and also not optimized for people who prefer audio communication. This report includes findings from the second year of a three-year project, funded by a grant from the National Park Service. Our first year on this project was spent getting to know the frameworks and foundations of the 342 brochures currently circulating in the country, through a deep reading of samples and a larger content analysis of the brochure structures and content genres. The second year of this project, which is the focus of this paper and poster presentation at SIGDOC 2016, revolves around the design-based research prototyping experiments we conducted as a way to create and refine a web tool to support and produce audio description, particularly in relation to the remediation of NPS brochures to audio-based mobile apps. This process led to prototyping experiments within the NPS that revealed a significant gap between practitioner knowledge and best practices. Those best practices also were found to be lacking in many areas, such as guidance for the practitioners to audio describe a NPS staple, the site map. While audio description, like open/closed captioning, might be considered a relatively straightforward process to those uninitiated in the activity, these practitioner experiments revealed many of the nuances and complexities of audio description that make it a difficult translation exercise. They also led to the generation of important scholarly research questions, such as "In what ways could one audio describe a map?"},

In turn, this process identifies key terms and trends in scholarship, illuminating how communities of knowledge and practice have been fostered in the field. This process also helps display institutional collaboration and engagement. Conversely, these visualizations also suggest how these communities of knowledge and practice have left many unaddressed gaps in 44 years of research. The findings of this study suggest that, while the field has thoroughly applied the topics of rhetoric, discourse, language, author and audience in relation to pedagogy and what those terms can offer classrooms, more classroom-based research is needed to demonstrate pedagogical practices and learning in the field of technical communication. Further, technical communication researchers have not yet outlined the efficacy of rhetorical pedagogy in relation to student learning and engagement in technical communication classrooms, despite advocating for its importance to students and future practitioners. As a result, I argue that the study of citation networks can provide technical communicators with a means to both evaluate the field's history and shape its future trajectory.},

Such ongoing controversies (often playing out over years and even decades) typify the reactionary model of risk communication [5] in which experts and public audiences communicate past rather than with each other (participatory model) in attempts to influence policy and opinions in the public sphere. In this project, we ask what role government-funded research plays in shaping these discourses. We begin with two government-funded research reports made available to the public in order to examine how these reports are linked, cited, and interpreted across various websites and social media. Mapping these communication practices can help us better understand the reactionary model, how communication design and medium contribute to this model, and possibilities for intervention to move toward a participatory model as advocated by scholars [1, 2].},

Through an analysis of the design and categories of activity reports from a range of universities, this poster examines the ways in which service as an academic activity is framed within academic reporting structures. Findings suggest that the categories institutions provide for documenting our service often do not reflect the complex service we perform in technical communication and may need to be troubled and interrogated in order to make our work visible. "Service" contextualizes faculty work in various ways, and its institutional acceptance as a necessary but rarely sufficient category for promotion may challenge the abilities of Technical Communication faculty to effectively explain the new work of communication design in documents such as annual reports.},

The study discovered that, for these scholars, note taking comprises the majority of the tweets. The additional prevalence of activity such as sharing resources, conversation, and whimsy show that conference tweeting is the digital extension of the community-building activity of face-to-face conferences.

Through a thorough analysis of an available body of literature in design studies and adjacent fields, conceptualizations of the user will be identified. Following this stage, willing staff members of 4 separate design and technology firms will be interviewed in a semi-structural fashion to assess the concept of the user in practice. This project has the potential to inform areas of design studies and human-computer interaction, especially regarding the increasing need to incorporate and serve diverse individuals and communities.},

abstract = {Growing ranges of industries, from manufacturing to surgery, demand 3D printing and technical communication experience. Simultaneously, the "Maker Movement" promotes sharing knowledge about emerging technologies among diverse participatory communities. This case study explores how 3D printing and Instructables (online user-produced instructions) facilitate teaching documentation, participatory design, and rhetoric effectively, and will inform participants how they can start using 3D modeling and printing in technical communication classrooms and curricula. The study presents an assignment sequence that asks students to respond to a social issue by collaboratively designing and 3D printing an object, and documenting their process by publishing an Instructable.},

abstract = {This study explores emergency department (ED) team activity, behaviors, and cues initiating interruptions among team members through the use of surveys and observations. These findings, along with user- and work-centered design processes, was used to design mobile communication applications for the ED team by providing interface cues similar to team "busyness" visual cues. These customizable functionalities provided to users have the potential to help better maintain team shared awareness and communication. With this new design of communication, we may be able to design for other types of team supported tools that will enhance coordination, communication, collaboration, and general team performance.},
