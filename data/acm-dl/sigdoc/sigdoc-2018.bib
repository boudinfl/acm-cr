abstract = {"Information" is a boundary concept affecting work in multiple sectors. This paper examines classical information theory and modern research in technical rhetoric and circulation to define "information" for technical communicators and designers as something other than a usable unit or quantified intelligence. Defining information as a pattern allows designers to consider what leads to "information" and what its consequences are as part of usability. This paper also examines how knowledge is being made in the current climate of uncertainty and institutional erosion.},

In an effort to fill some of those gaps, this paper explores an amateur game design community with visible ongoing documentation practices. This research is meant to help establish cognates to professional game design practices in the service of building out the broader game design ecology.

abstract = {This paper introduces a foundation for revising how a professional writing program approaches information design learning for students across the university. We argue that the rise of information-related skills as a technical communication competency alongside the rise of big data as a sociotechnical phenomenon require us to rethink outcomes and assignments. In particular, these issues point to the need to emphasize design at the level of complex information rather than only at the broad level of the page or screen. As a first step in planning an approach to information design that is responsive to these needs, the authors have reviewed their local professional writing learning outcomes in response to a review of relevant literature, have developed flexible assignment guidelines, and have constructed a plan for integrating new assignments into the curriculum. The next stage of this research will implement a theory-driven information design assignment and evaluate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Most peer-reviewed journals in the field of Technical and Professional Communication have as a goal to publish research articles on problem, trends, and practices in the field to meet the needs of readers working in industry and academia. The hope is that readers working in industry use published research results to problem solve and improve practices. No studies to date, however, have examined practitioner experiences reading and responding to published academic research. We do not know the extent to which practitioners in the field use academic research or find it valuable, relevant, or accessible. This paper reports the results of interviews with 11 seasoned practitioners in the field who were asked to read 12 peer-reviewed articles and six trade articles and then share their experiences and perspectives. Results suggest that practitioners think much academic research applies to them but is not communicated in a way that makes the application clear. To encourage practitioners to seek out articles and apply research results, study participants urge researchers to highlight practical applications and potential use cases and to write with a practitioner audience in mind. Participants also urge journal editors and boards to consider creating companion blogs or magazines for publishing executive abstracts of articles. They further suggest that journals consider revising authoring guidelines and templates to increase the accessibility of articles for practitioner readers.},

abstract = {Successful task performance in a health or medical-related activity, especially in treating critical patients through biotechnology in resource-constrained settings, is determined by product usability that emphasizes the ease of use, error recovery, efficiency, and satisfaction. This means that technical products designed to be used in this context need to be efficient and easy to use. Research findings and suggestions laid out in this paper will highlight the importance of use context that allows for effective use of technological products across cultures. Successful patient treatments through biotechnology in resource-constrained settings and health communications are intrinsically connected to the concept of product usability. Such goals can be achieved through localized UX design practices that help users perform their desired tasks with speed, accuracy, and satisfaction, and thus promote social justice and inclusion in resource-constrained settings. Through a case study, this paper shares findings related to usability problems in technology transfer from industrialized nations to an underrepresented, underdeveloped country. The article provides implications of the findings, suggesting that designers in industrialized nations should consider how technological products designed through localized usability can be better positioned to be used for promoting social justice and human rights in the underserved, undeveloped countries.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the results of an empirical study that analyzed how people understand the data presented to them in deceptive data visualizations when those visualizations are paired with non-deceptive text. This study was administered as an online user survey and was designed to test the extent to which deceptive data visualizations can fool users, even when they are accompanied by a paragraph of accurate text. The study consisted of a basic demographic questionnaire, chart familiarity assessment, and data visualization survey. A total of 256 participants completed the survey and were evenly distributed between a control (non-deceptive) survey and a test (deceptive) survey in which participants were asked to observe a paragraph of text and a data visualization. Participants then answered a question relevant to the observed information to measure how they perceived the information. The results of the study confirmed that deceptive techniques in data visualizations caused participants to misinterpret the information in the deceptive data visualizations even when they were accompanied by accurate explanatory text. Furthermore, certain demographics and comfort levels with chart types were more susceptible to certain types of deceptive techniques. These results highlight the importance of education and awareness in the area of data visualizations to ensure deceptive practices are not utilized on the part of developers and to avoid misinformation on the part of users.},

abstract = {This paper explores the emerging field of human-embedded medical technology and its accompanying need for innovative user experience (UX) design. Specifically, the paper argues that, in the medium term, augmented reality (AR) can effectively serve as one part of a multimodal user interface (UI) for diabetes patients with embedded control systems for an artificial pancreas (AP). The paper explores what types of cross-disciplinary information UX designers will need in order to incorporate AR into an effective multimodal interface for diabetes patients with an AP. Currently, researchers are developing methods to embed continuous glucose monitors (CGM), model predictive control (MPC) systems, and AP systems into diabetes patients to regulate their blood sugar levels [30]. Ideally, an embedded control in a wearable medical device would remove the need for users to interact with the system because the system would self-regulate. However, once embedded, not only will a physician/technician need to initialize and adjust the system, but, ethically and practically, patients will also need access to the system. In the medium-term future (5-10 years), AR-with its emphasis on cross-disciplinary design needs-shows promise for conveying visual information most effectively to the patient. This paper addresses the interdisciplinary nature of conveying user information for embedded medical devices because it demonstrates the need for UX designers to integrate recent advancements in healthcare research, medical technology, cross-disciplinary design theory (e.g. human factors and effective use theory), and the rapidly changing nature of human-computer interaction (HCI).},

Using the documents, we created and museum contexts as an example, we explain that UX concepts can be broadly applied to other industries in order to inform participation practices. The main takeaway from our research is that UX terms and concepts are flexible enough to be applied to multiple industries in order to improve the effectiveness of an organization or institution's current participatory elements and help them reach their goals regarding user participation.},

In this report, we discuss how we modified traditional usability methods and tailored them for a teen audience. We share takeaways including keep methods and tools lightweight and facilitation styles engaging and casual. We assert that modifying methods is a key consideration for conducting usability testing with any unique group of users.},

abstract = {I have observed that technical communication lessons with a real-world impact provide students with a more engaging learning experience. While this observation is consistent with the theory of adult learning, it is an ongoing challenge to keep the examples fresh from term to term. This report describes my experience developing the piClinic Console from the beginning of project in the spring of 2017 to the present. The piClinic Console is a low-cost, patient information system designed for use in limited-resource clinics in lower-middle-income countries. In addition to helping these clinics begin to automate their patient records, the project has provided opportunities to demonstrate and apply technical communication skills in a real-world context and has initiated inter-departmental and international collaborations. This experience report describes a brief history of how the project began, the design and educational lessons it has provided to our students, the collaborations it has encouraged, some lessons learned, and the plans for future development.},

abstract = {The primary assumption of human-centered design is that humans should be the focus of design and decision making when creating technology and information products. However, when certain types of people are consistently centered, others are intentionally or unintentionally pushed to the margins or left out altogether. In this panel, the speakers discuss how centering overlooked, vulnerable, or marginalized audiences leads to different design considerations, methods, practices and resulting designs. Topics include issues of queering consent, humanitarian organizations and interventions, multilingual user experience, and women of color in design. The panel concludes with a discussion of the implications of centering marginalized audiences and a call for a reinvigorated conceptualization of ethics in UX.},

abstract = {Due to technological advances in data collection and distribution methods, data is increasing in size and complexity. Challenges and opportunities have emerged in the design of data visualization tools, particularly in the visualization of geospatial and multidimensional data. Traditional visualization approaches are falling behind as they lack effective design solutions for usability issues posed by the complex relationship between spatial and numeric data. Interdisciplinary approaches are essential to address issues in geovisualization, thus the field of human-computer interaction can act as a useful lens upon the problems of data discovery within seemingly disparate fields such as climate and agricultural sciences. ATLAS is a tool for the discovery and visualization of multidimensional geospatial data (MDGSD) and aims to aid data discovery. It proposes a new approach to the visualization of MDGSD: creating a single, 'multi-modal' interface for both spatial and time-series information. Benefits and failures inherent in this approach were identified though user testing. Tests were administered to nine college students pursuing various fields of study. Preliminary analysis of data suggests that participants recognize a relationship between the spatial and time-series information; however, subjects disagreed about the significance of colors across them. Our future work aims to utilize eye tracking data to determine whether data discovery is successfully enabled in ATLAS by examining how participants visually assess and connect the data. ATLAS offers insight on the emerging opportunities of interdisciplinary work in human-computer interaction and data visualization.},

abstract = {This presentation advocates responsive data visualization design in risk communication practices by applying principles of information design [1] to the National Weather Service's online weather maps. Citizens are consuming information via smartphones at an increasing rate, with 12% of Americans using these types of devices as their only source for web content [2]. Research shows that users read texts on a computer screen differently than a printed document [3], making the need for readable information and design prevalent for user experience and experience architecture.Data visualization continues to influence users through their design and display of content. Modern development strategies allow for visualization based on proximity, as seen in location maps for natural disasters [4]. Often invisible to the user, design choices create structures of power between agent and agency, leaving citizens vulnerable to manipulation of data. Risk management organizations have strong obligations to the public to ensure these visualizations are reliable, clear, and reflective of audience needs.The concept of Responsive Web Design was introduced around 2010 [5], but the adaptation in technical communication has been a slow process. Perhaps the resistance is because of the perceived complexity of responsive coding, or that readability is an invisible problem. What is even slower, it appears, is the consideration of how data visualizations appear on mobile devices, even when the main design is responsive. Regardless of the reasons for the slow adoption of responsive design, practices need to be altered to make communication easier for the user to follow and understand in times of emergency.Scholars have depicted how advancements in technology altered the process and responsibilities of technical communicator [6-7]. With technology providing the means for users to have access to technical information within seconds, it is essential that technical communicators be able to predict the needs and adaptations from online accessibility. By assessing the National Weather Service's web design through accessibility checks such as responsive design, this presentation is able to showcase the capabilities of data visualization and risk communication in digital spaces.With the mission of the National Weather Service being to "provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enhancement of the national economy," the ability to access online information across device platforms is crucial to achieve this government agency's goals. This presentation promotes the reassessment of online data visualizations based on their usability in terms of design and responsiveness to device-specific formats, particularly in the genre of risk management organizations. It is the responsibility of these organizations to maintain web standards across online platforms.},
