abstract = {Few users of computer applications seek help from the documentation. This paper reports the results of an empirical study of why this is so and examines how, in real work, users solve their usability problems. Based on in-depth interviews with 25 subjects representing a varied cross-section of users, we find that users do avoid using both paper and online help systems. Few users have paper manuals for the most heavily used applications, but none complained about their lack. Online help is more likely to be consulted than paper manuals, but users are equally likely to report that they solve their problem by asking a colleague or experimenting on their own. Users cite difficulties in navigating the help systems, particularly difficulties in finding useful search terms, and disappointment in the level of explanation found.},

It also aims to decrease risk levels associated to the requirements phase and improves overall completeness. The feasibility of the proposed method is shown in a Composting 101 tutorial example created in Macromedia Flash and corresponding MS Powerpoint documents. MURMER investigation is compared to other UML-driven schemes. Its efficiency is based on simplicity and completeness. It is also effective as a risk mitigator.},

It is in this context that we analyzed in what extent document genres are employed by users to describe digital resources, in order to be displayed in small display device.

abstract = {The digital games industry has grown to the size of the film industry and is going to leave the box office far behind. Computers with their advanced graphics capabilities have contributed to the immersive interactive experience which attracts many to spend more leisure time playing digital games than watching television. The available CPU power of home computers and notebook PCs is setting the stage for game AI; console development shows a similar trend. Digital games and their potential social impact are subject to a heated debate worldwide which is fueled by tragic events such as the 1999 deadly shooting at the Columbine Highschool, Littleton, CO, USA, or the 2002 amok run at the Gutenberg Highschool in Erfurt, Germany. This debate is getting even more controversal when digital games such as the Super Columbine Massacre RPG enter the stage. Clearly, digital games may be seen as entertainment media. Established approaches of media research apply. Digital games must be also seen as IT application systems. They are, in particular, systems of Artificial Intelligence. The invited talk addresses issues of digital games' impact on social behavior. Emphasis is put on an interdisciplinary approach which is new, to some extent, to digital games studies in media and communication science. As presentation agenda, some list of problems is identified. For every problem, there will be undertaken the endeavor of developing new ideas of game playing and designing novel games such that the identified problem changes or, in the best case, possibly disappears},

abstract = {Nowadays websites use, above all, the "visual channel" to communicate content, functionality and navigation/interaction capabilities. Users who, permanently or temporarily, cannot use their eyes to interact with an application (not only visuallyimpaired but also people who cannot look at the screen while interacting) need a new paradigm of interaction, based on an "aural" access to information. Current technological approaches for developing "aural hypertexts" (such as speech markup languages, or code optimization techniques for screen-readers) provide technical solutions to transform a visual interaction into an aural one, failing to support adequately the overall design process. This paper presents an overview of critical design issues to consider when conceiving aural hypertexts, namely when designing "aural" information architecture, navigation and interaction features. Examples of possible "aural" design solutions are also discussed to support specific requirements. The work is based upon real-life project experience in both designing web applications and developing applications for visually-impaired users},

abstract = {Visually impaired users are hindered in their efforts to access the largest repository of electronic information in the world, namely the World Wide Web (Web). A visually impaired users information and presentation requirements are different from a sighted user in that they are highly egocentric and non-visual. These requirements can become problems in that the Web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information order/layout, this can (and does) hinder users who need presentation-agnostic access to information. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into documents can help to alleviate these problems and support users who wish to understand the content as opposed to the presentation and order of the information. If this is to happen in the "real world", however, authors must incur no "design overhead" when creating documents. Our solution, Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence (SADIe) involves building ontologies of Cascading Sytle-Sheets (CSS) and using those ontologies to transformWeb pages. In this way we find that we can indeed "tame" inaccessible Web pages},

The difficulty is that Nielsen's heuristic evaluation [10, 13], with which the protocol is often paired, specifically requires Type 3 verbalizations - data that is deemed unreliable by Ericsson and Simon. A different theory, which considers the attributes of the individual and is also from cognitive science and Simon [5], is suggested to reconcile the theory with the practice of verbal protocols},

This paper proposes a framework to convert a data flow diagram and an entity relationship diagram into UML artifact, including a use case diagram, sequence diagrams, and a class diagram. The new UML model can be used by analysts or computer aided software engineering tools to implement new object-oriented system. The set of rules for transformation is tested on a structured analysis and design example},

abstract = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a new technology that was proposed to improve separation of concerns in software development. AOP's main focus is to use aspect modules to implement concerns that would be generally scattered across the system and tangled with other modules (crosscutting concerns). Although much research has focused on AOP's application to traditional software development, little has been done towards its application to Web development. Aspect-oriented PHP (aoPHP) is an addition to PHP that allows the use of AOP in the Web development context. In this paper we describe an application of aoPHP to show that AOP can also be effectively used in theWeb development context. In particular, we have implemented two crosscutting concerns in a collaborative Web system named CoTeia: the access control and the version control functionalities. Furthermore, we discuss how AOP can enhance the design of Web applications by reasoning on the refactored system},

abstract = {Legacy application systems have been widely used by user communities, and by individual users. They are currently providing a variety of functions required by system development requirements. For the development of a new 3D system using such legacy systems, we need both (i) the migration of legacy systems into a new 3D system environment, and (ii) interoperations among these systems. This paper proposes a framework for the ad hoc integration of a 2D legacy GIS, legacy simulators, and legacy databases, which are not a priori assumed to be integrated with each other. For this purpose, we first propose a mechanism to migrate a 2D legacy system with its GUI into a 3D environment. This mechanism is based on a special coordinate transformation for both the texture mapping and the event dispatching. It enables us to use a 3D terrain model with a shadow copy of a 2D legacy GIS. As for legacy geographic simulators and legacy databases without any GUI, we provide them with their proxy objects. These proxy objects can interoperate with each other, and also with the shadow copy of a 2D legacy GIS through their slot connections. As a result, our approach enables us to dynamically integrate multiple independent legacy simulators and/or legacy databases with a 2D legacy GIS simply through the composition of their 3D display objects},

The second is to explore the systemic coordination of human-generated text which enables one specific contact center to meet both physical repair and rhetorical goals.This paper may be of interest to researchers in genre analysis, organizational documentation, Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), and HCI.},

abstract = {As modern technical products like cars become more and more sophisticated, there is an increasing demand for a new type of technical documentation, for the owners and in particular for repair and maintenance staff. To achieve this goal the instructions should be visualized by technologies adding dynamic information as a further dimension to the so far static information. A potential technology is Augmented Reality that makes it easier to understand the operation to be carried out. The superimposed and animated action becomes an additional information carrier. However, this makes high demands on the authoring process. The creation process of technical documentation is an expensive and time-consuming task especially for complex products. To make this process more cost-efficient computerized support is requiredIn the future the basis for all documentation will be a generic document model. This model includes all work steps, e.g. in the context of a repair manual, covering all cars of a type series. The adaptation of the manual to the particular product will be realized by the computer system at runtime. The availability of an adequate authoring environment is a prerequisite for the deployment of technical documentations based on new technologies in the future. We present the concept for a generic document model and an authoring environment based on the separation of content from representation. It provides a creation framework for the document model, the included workflows and visualizations, and automatically adapts documentations to the real world},

Each of these operations is seen as an event that must be notified only to those users whose subscriptions match the document's description. The paper addresses the problem of efficiently supporting the notification process, and makes contributions in two directions: (a) definition of a formal model for the publish/subscribe process; (b) proposal of a semi-lattice structure for subscriptions allowing the filtering out of non matching subscriptions.
