abstract = {Technical communicators are now generating large amounts of content (which may or may not be web-based), that is used to communicate concepts and ideas for decision making. They are creating information that helps readers reduce their uncertainty about the overall situation and its future development as they read to decide. The information needs of complex information situations can be redefined as working to reduce the uncertainty people have about the situation. It helps people build a clearer picture of the overall situation and reduces uncertainty about the future development of the situation. This redefinition reshapes a design team's goal from answering the question of "what information does the reader need?" to "what information reduces the reader's uncertainty?" As design teams work with their personas or other information analysis methods, they need to remain focused on determining how people use that information to reduce their uncertainty. Too many information creation projects suffer from different groups all lobbing for their content to be included; a focus on reducing uncertainty helps cut through that lobbying. By focusing on the reduction of uncertainty, we have a basis for determining what information is needed, measuring what information is used, and judging the communication effectiveness. Questions posed before, during or after a usability test should be constructed specifically to measure the reduction in uncertainty.},

Systems can be extremely complex, and contain many subsystems and components. The presentation of technical communication for a system of systems adds layers of complexity both to explaining the basic concepts of the system and all the details required for each area of the system that may be applicable to each type of user or role, function, and operation. It becomes more critical and yet more difficult to provide clear and comprehensive overviews and details of a system and its subsystems and components, as the complexity increases.},

abstract = {Instructional design lies at the interface of systems theory, theories of teaching and learning, technology, and design. These fields together pose epistemological challenges to instructional designers. In this report I examine one element widely used by instructional designers, specifically the template designed and widely distributed by the Commonwealth of Learning (COL). In analyzing how the template serves intended users (who are instructional designers), I find that efficiency and effectiveness rooted in scientific models of objectivity to effectively corral massive information into manageable yet accessible knowledge for specific needs while expedient can have its drawbacks. I argue that a key emphasis on thinking as an active transaction between an individual and the data to which that individual is exposed permeates not just information, but also Instructional Design. Formalized within that role is a system of reasoning used to generate solutions to problems and in fostering skills in acquiring concepts. And it is missing in a template application such as COL's.},

A salient feature of the study was that the testing was conducted by a blind user with training in Information Design, Technical Communication, and Accessibility. The qualitative data gathered in this study suggests that the accessibility and usability in the present time voice-retrofitted ATM systems leaves much to desire. In fact, this researcher failed to accomplish most of the planned banking tasks on the four ATM systems tested in this study. The researcher recommends that disabled users must be engaged in the initial stages of designing such support systems so that the accessibility features could be built into the machine interface and less than satisfactory retrofits could be avoided.},

We offer, therefore, a way of understanding the Scrum process framework as a powerful orienting genre that facilitates collective development practice by stabilizing and intermediating a host of related, dynamic genres and artifacts.},

Students were engaged as active co-designers in the system, examining existing applications online offering similar services, discussing relevant research in building online communities, and ultimately re-designing the system to make it context-appropriate for different deployment scenarios.

abstract = {Digital backchannels have become an increasingly important field of study for researchers investigating educational technologies. We designed and deployed one such backchannel integrated with a public display -- ClassCommons -- in a 15-week field study that took place in a university classroom. We extracted and analyzed the communication patterns that emerged in the use of ClassCommons. In this paper, we use these data to address the following research questions: how do students appropriate public digital backchannels in classrooms, what communication patterns are typical in classroom digital public backchannels, how if at all do students' participation in the digital public backchannels evolve over an extended period of time and what are the characteristics of the messages that get more responses from other students?},

It provides foundations for a fundamental shift from consumer cultures (specialized in producing finished goods to be consumed passively) to cultures of participation (in which all people are provided with the means to participate actively in personally meaningful activities). These frameworks explore and support new approaches for the design, adoption, appropriation, adaptation, evolution, and sharing of artifacts by all participating stakeholders. Meta-design and cultures of participation are not dictated by technology alone: they are the result of incremental shifts in human behavior and social organizations.},

However, studies of such interactions have reported persistent communication problems that appear to be due to mismatches in non-native and native speakers' language proficiency. With this problem in mind, we have been exploring a conceptual design called Instant Annotation. Our design concept supports a kind of threading in chat using annotation, thus offering para-communication support in cross-cultural group chat. As part of this design investigation, we studied native and non-native speakers in a group chat activity, shared the new design concept, and interviewed users to gather their feedback about the Instant Annotation concept. The results pointed to three different design use cases and led us to envision four general design features that we will explore in our ongoing work. We discuss the cross-cultural communication problem, findings from the interview study, the current design and future directions.},

abstract = {The primary mechanism for navigating a website consists of pages with lists of links (or indexes). Such indexes are most effective when they convey the necessary hint (or scent) to anticipate the content they point to. When indexes fail to do so, users who are seeking specific information need to click on a link just to explore where it leads to, and then go back to the index to select another item. In a study with 150 participants, we explored whether guided tour navigation -- which enables users to linearly browse items without going back to the index -- could outperform scentless indexes in fact-finding tasks. Our results suggest that indexes remain a better solution than guided tours, even when lacking information scent. Guided tours, however, improve user's performance when the target content is found in the first half of collection with 20 items. Implications for designing effective navigation patterns are discussed.},

Affect is one such dimension that can play a crucial role in the dynamics, creativity, and productivity of distributed groups. We contribute an adaptation of the grounded theory methodology as a flexible and extensible means for constructing a taxonomy of affect in text-based online communication. Such a taxonomy can serve as an analytic lens for the continued investigation of the role of affect in creative collaborative endeavors as mediated by communication technology. We describe our modified grounded theory approach and then validate our method by constructing a taxonomy with data from chat logs collected during a longitudinal study of a multi-cultural distributed scientific collaboration.},

Our approach takes a "snapshot" of usability problems and behaviors across a heterogeneous sample of users, ranging from novice to expert. Our analysis suggests that a cross-sectional methodology can distinguish between less experienced and more experienced users with respect to the kinds of applications that cause frustration, frequency of use of help, and whether the problem was solved. Our analysis also suggests that the method is poor at distinguishing causes of frustration and the overall distribution of types of solutions tried. The data also suggest that three months of use of an application is the most useful point at which to distinguish less-experienced from more-experienced users.},

The project encourages researchers and practitioners to see value in visual analytics as new forms and rhetorical applications of data mining.

I consider the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' cash incentive for EMR adoption, and the "meaningful use" criteria that mediate that incentive (Table 1). Based on this research and my own small-scale study of real time EMR use, I outline the ways that the same problems had by EMR usability researchers are also had by actual EMR users, themselves. Specifically, questions about how to account for both embodied and cognitive effects, how to discern noise from useful information, and how to make useful what is available are all concerns shared by both care providers using EMRs and those who study EMR usability. As a result, I propose that communication design researchers design usability studies that use Mol et al's [9] construct of "care" (as a practice) as the gold standard for "meaningful use." That is, meaningful use of EMR software ought to be articulated less in terms of task-oriented record-keeping practices and the time it takes to accomplish them, but in terms of Mol et al's three components of good care: embodied practices, attuned attentiveness, and adaptive tinkering.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the works of the Keio-NUS CUTE Center at the National University of Singapore in order to uncover the dispositions of "analogness" and "digitalness" in regards to the relationship between users and interfaces. By comparing concepts of embodiment from a philosophical perspective, paired with the computer science treatment of analog and digital data, we derive a contingent definition for analog-like and digital-like interaction. With case studies as reference, we outline a continuum to describe types of interfaces based on these dispositions, which could then be further analyzed using characteristics for designing analog-like, digital-like or hybrid-like interactive systems. Finally, we propose a new methodology for designing novel interactive systems that are analog in nature, called interactive analog media (IAM).},

abstract = {Digital applications and web-based user experiences increasingly incorporate social web technologies that enable the user to become a participant, or someone who actively co-constructs content, context, and meaning in digital ecosystems. This paper explores the user experience of participation by establishing a working definition of the concept and discussing why it is important to researching and designing digital communication tools. The case study presented in this paper explores the ways that user-generated content produced with the game LittleBigPlanet and the community that this content supports are intricately linked to local inventions embedded within cultural practices that improve support people's efforts to learn how to participate within the social web ecosystem. I demonstrate that participation relies on one's ability to coordinate with other participants via social web ecosystems in order to explore digital tools and perform knowledge work. Thus, the user experience of participation can be traced to these local inventions and the culturally situated practices of participants that leverage digital applications to develop, document, and share knowledge with each other. The conclusion to this paper offers preliminary concepts necessary to defining the user experience of participation and to theorizing participation as a critical component of researching and designing social web ecosystems.},

In doing so, we describe how participants navigate among genres and artifacts within a minimum of three overlapping genre assemblages to design transmedia narratives: (1) the course genre assemblage, (2) their discipline-specific assemblage, and (3) their individual genre ecology. We explore individual genre ecologies in detail, describing how participants frequently incorporated ad hoc genres into their workflow as a way of navigating the expectations and genre norms of broader, overlapping assemblages.},

However, to increase the workers' awareness about the structure of their work and to help them with the execution of their work processes, a suitable visualization is necessary. Up to now, interaction histories have typically been visualized with the classical Gantt, bar or line charts, neglecting the information contained in links between the individual items in an interaction history. Moreover, clear and empirically grounded guidance for the choice of the visualization is currently lacking. We present two graph-based visualizations for interaction histories and evaluate them against the classical visualizations in a controlled experiment. From the results, we derive a set of recommendations for the visualizations best suited for the different tasks within information workers' work processes.},

abstract = {Computer technology has made amazing advances in the past few decades; however, the software documentation of today still looks strikingly similar to the software documentation used 30 years ago. If this continues into the 21st century, more and more software developers could be using 20th-century-style documentation to solve 21st-century problems with 21st-century technologies. Is 20th-century-style documentation up to the challenge? How can that be measured? This paper seeks to answer those questions by developing a heuristic to identify whether the documentation set for an application programming interface (API) contains the key elements of API reference documentation that help software developers learn an API. The resulting heuristic was tested on a collection of software documentation that was chosen to provide a diverse set of examples with which to validate the heuristic. In the course of testing the heuristic, interesting patterns in the API documentation were observed. For example, twenty-five percent of the documentation sets studied did not have any overview information, which, according to studies, is one of the most basic elements an API documentation set needs to help software developers learn to use the API. The heuristic produced by this research can be used to evaluate large sets of API documentation, track trends in API documentation, and facilitate additional research.},

QuikScan Views provides a hyperlinked table of contents for global navigation, displays QuikScan summaries in a scrolling window (as well as within the body of the document), and adds an extra level of summarization by means of a hyperlinked structured abstract.

abstract = {The world of today and its new technologies like smartphones, tablets, or any flat interaction surface has increasing the need for graphical user interfaces integrating gestural interaction in which 2D pen-based gestures are properly used. Integrating this interaction modality in streamlined software development represents a significant challenge for designers or developers: it requires important knowledge in gestures management, in deciding which gesture recognition algorithm should be used or refined for which types of gestures, or which usability knowledge should be used for supporting the development. These skills usually belong to experts for gesture interaction and not actors usually involved in user interface design process. In this paper, we present a structured method for facilitating the integration of gestures in graphical user interfaces by describing the roles of the gesture specialist and other stakeholders involved in the development life cycle, and the process of cooperation leading to the creation of a gesture-based user interface. The method consists of three pillars: a conceptual model for describing gestures on top of graphical user interfaces and its associated language, a step-wise approach for defining gestures depending on the end user's task, and a software that supports this approach. This method is exemplified with a running example in the area of document navigation.},

Although the FMA has been developed as a computer-parsable resource that is intended to enable computers to reason about human anatomy, it is also important to present the FMA in a manner that can be more easily understood by humans. Current interfaces for accessing the FMA do not adequately reveal the structure of the FMA to the user, nor do they support intuitive navigation through the ontology. As the first step toward designing a new interface, this paper describes an extensive inquiry into conceptualizations of both anatomy and the FMA. This user-centered process led to a design that will serve as a basis for the implementation of a web-based browser.},

The study illustrates a 4-stage participatory design process in which contributors voluntarily participate in varied events that contributed to the design effort, refining the technology that is meant to provide insight into the communicative practices of knowledge workers. This paper reports on this design process in light of six design and functional requirements for visualizations of writing activity and knowledge work more broadly. The paper proposes new design and functional requirements for visualizing writing activity and future directions for the technology.},

By paying attention to the cultural-historical situatedness of a given author, his or her terminology, and the ostensible function of activity theory within each piece, a more comprehensive understanding of the adaptive nature of activity theoretical approaches to design of communication emerges. And as activity theory continues to be used within disciplines relevant to design of communication, a framework for understanding both the previous and potential roles of activity theory in the scholarly literature is needed and is provided, in part, by our analysis.},

Doing the exercises at home without the supervision of a physical therapist raises the risk that patients do not execute the activities in a safe and effective manner. To address this problem, we developed a serious exergame to improve engagement and the efficiency of the rehabilitation process. A team of game developers, physiotherapists and a researcher collaborated to contribute to the design and prototype development. This led to a prototype using Microsoft Kinect as an input device to engage users combined with an individualized setup that provides visual rewarding and corrective feedback to the patient and a communication channel to the therapist to enable performance monitoring.This interdisciplinary process we were engaged in has implications for the development of engaging exergames that communicate clinically relevant performance information to elderly patients through a visual feedback tool.},

abstract = {Fourteen faculty participants each read two letters of application to a graduate program, and the data about how they read was collected using eye-tracking and think-aloud protocol. The eyetracking data show that expert readers not only "slow down" when they encounter grammatical and other errors, but also when they see words and phrases that match their program's mission or their own research interests. The think-aloud protocol data was used to verify eye-tracking results and also to allow for readers to expand on their impressions of the persuasiveness of a given letter. The project is not finished, but early impressions are that something akin to Kenneth Burke's concept of identification is a powerfully persuasive move in such letters--readers' eyes fixate on these identification moves and the participants identify those moves as positive and persuasive.},

abstract = {In this poster presentation, the author traces health communication in online spaces, especially conversations about hypothyroidism on Twitter. Specifically, the author looks at how participants on Twitter use the hashtag #hypothyroidism for patient agency and advocacy. The strength of ties between #hypothyroidism (the Twitter hashtag) and the actors necessary for its existence is also discussed. This poster presentation argues that Twitter can strengthen patient agency and advocacy in both online and offline relationships between hypothyroidism patients and healthcare professionals. Patient agency and advocacy is accomplished because Twitter helps to build communities of support between and among patients and professionals through the immediacy and accessibility of information.},

The pilot study found that, unlike other studies conducted on Twitter streams, the #hpv stream broadcasts information as opposed to interacting and conversing. The researcher plans to build upon this study by expanding the pilot dataset as a means to explore if preliminary findings in the initial study stand. The goal is to create a set of communication practices that happen within this ontology so that the space can be defined accordingly and compared with other streams of information on Twitter.},
