abstract = {The consensus of the documentation literature is that users rarely use help, usually preferring to muddle through. To increase use of help, tutorials for novice users could be changed from guided presentations toward using the system's actual help system. To determine whether this approach would increase users' use of help when they encountered problems with an application, we developed an alternative, help-based tutorial introduction to Microsoft Publisher. We compared the behaviors of users introduced to Publisher with the help-based tutorial with the behaviors of users who learned from a traditional tutorial. A balanced study of 22 novice users of Publisher suggests that using a help-based tutorial leads to significantly greater use of help systems when users encounter problems. However, the data also suggest that the increased use of help may not lead to more effective task performance.},

abstract = {UML diagrams are used to model real-world ideas and help users understand complex programming concepts. Developers and writers need to produce well-formed UML diagrams that can convey these ideas, and that are suitable for publishing in technical documentation. This paper examines the evolution of UML diagrams and tooling, with a focus on practices at the IBM Toronto Software Laboratory. It reviews the findings of two previous papers, which described obstacles to creating UML diagrams for publication and outlined numerous steps to help developers, writers, and graphic designers create useful UML diagrams. It shows how developers at the IBM Toronto Software Laboratory have added new features to existing modeling programs to improve the usability and design functions in IBM's suite of modeling tools. It describes the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two main types of graphics, and illustrates the beneficial impact of the addition of the SVG graphic export function to IBM's tooling. It shows how these functional improvements have resulted in a higher quality of UML diagrams submitted for publication by both technical and non-technical users.},

It also highlights features of simplification for BP, which may differ from other languages. Moreover, we propose simplification strategies and a Simplification Annotation Editor. This study consists of the first step towards building BP text simplification systems. One of the scenarios in which these systems could be used is that of reading electronic texts produced, e.g., by the Brazilian government or by news agencies.},

abstract = {If designing and developing optimal products, services, and information requires clarity and audience awareness, then developing ways to acquire customer input is a critical piece in the best development workflow solutions [43]. Seeking direct input from customers and learning how they use a product are the most effective methods for generating ideas for enhancements and innovations to the technical content that supports a product, as well as to the product itself [21].Taking the steps to create opportunities for customer feedback enables direct customer input and establishes the proactive best practice of demonstrating to the customer that they are a top priority in the product development focus [34].While there may not be a fixed agenda for an optimal customer meeting, there may, in fact, be a set of topics for discussion that comprise a set of best practices for gaining customer input for the user assistance [45].Customer input helps provide requests for change and thus aids in managing change, raising the importance of a change and requirements management system [34, 52]. A change and requirements management system is even more critical in the context of application lifecycle management and globally distributed development [27, 49, 50, 55].Managing relationships with customers leads to a two-way path for collaboration, both for helping customers solve their problems and for a company to enhance its products and overall success [26, 28].},

More than one support engineer had written a short document describing the installation tasks, but these documents pre-supposed a high level of expertise on the part of the installer. The challenge presented to Information Engineering was to create, from two such documents, a text that a customer could use to install the software tools.With the help of a world-wide team, internet tools, and two virtual sessions following user-centered design practices, a customer-oriented document was successfully created quickly at very low cost.

The study comprised of two parts and on each part participants were tested on a different website. Results showed that in the first part participants who used the violating site performed worse and were more disoriented than participants who used the conventional version. But the performance of the participants of the convention-violating group improved over time so that by the end of the first part performance on both groups were equivalent. In the second part performance and disorientation on both groups were equivalent suggesting that users might rapidly adapt to visual convention violations.},

Successful information design for the Web, however, needs careful choices about communication styles and structural elements, to create really useful news complements. In this article we focus on the multimedia component of on-line newspapers, which is surely one of their most distinctive features compared to printed versions. Using eye tracking technology, we have studied five main design issues related to multimedia, obtaining results which could only be guessed with "traditional" usability tests.},

From the aspect of recognition, well-design information structures were hypothesized to have fewer number of fixation and high sensitivity because well-designed menu structures reflecting the users' mental model would be well match with the product's menu structure, resulting in reducing the number of fixations.In this study, we propose a methodology based on the analysis of the sensitivity of the user fixation to support the design and evaluation of a user-centered menu structure relative to the human perception of information structure.},

The sheer number of items in a software product that can be subject to translation is overwhelming. The issue is further compounded as the number of required target languages increases.This situation aptly describes the IBM® technical documentation translation challenge. With each passing year, the number of documentation pages grows. It is safe to assume that the number of graphics used to improve user comprehension also increases proportionately along with the amount of new textual information.A system and process to automate translation is a necessity to curb the escalating cost of providing national language versions of graphics. IBM has such a system and process; however, they have been in place since the years of hardcopy manuals with some minor adjustments added when the World Wide Web tide swept the globe in the 1990s.Many years have passed and the method of producing technical documentation has changed with the introduction of XML and new graphics file formats. The time has come to revisit the current process of creating graphics, inserting them in an XML authoring environment, and then translating the whole package.This paper describes the current globalization of graphics environment and preliminary investigation into using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to improve the end-to-end translation process},

The communication system is divided into different spheres (sources, channels, and destinations), each with its own five interior stages: receiving, processing, creating, releasing, and communicating information. The flow of information is ontologically distinguished from the flow of physical signals. Accordingly, Shannon's and network-based OSI models are redesigned.},

abstract = {The technical communicator's job has changed from creating a document to creating information appropriate for a communication situation with multiple user groups and highly dynamic information needs. Many of the communication failure issues we consistently see have a root cause not based on how people interact with computers, but with a failure to understand how information is communicated to a person and how they interact with and interpret that information. It is a failure of effective Human-information interaction (HII), which emphasizes communicating information---interacting with, interpreting, and using information---not writing documents, not designing web sites, not generating content. Producing modern web-based information requires a solid understanding of HII to increase the success of creating information which communicates effectively to all readers. The information design and creation must be based on a clear understanding of a person's goals and information needs and how that person interacts with information. Developing information which fits a person's need requires understanding how a person thinks and what factors drives their decision processes. These elements form for the base of an understanding of HII.},

abstract = {The effect of gender in academic achievement has often been the focus of research because of its potential implications. However, the Web has modified the way people access and use information. The present study examines the differences between males' and females' reading behaviour in hypertexts. The study focuses on text based electronic documents. Ninety participants (27 females and 63 males) read a hierarchically structured hypertext and answered a set of questions. The study examines some original variables not previously studied comprehensively, such as coherence of transactions, sum of selected hyperlinks, hyperlink location etc. The results show that gender did not significantly affect any of the measured variables. The data consisted of reading times, comprehension scores, coherent links, hyperlink location, sum of hyperlinks, and the sum of read nodes.},

abstract = {The ability to extract and merge data that from documents (or databases) of different types, in order to acquire knowledge from a vast repository of information, is of unquestionable value. However that desirable integration is not an easy task. Different approaches can be followed to achieve it, ranging from the merge of resources (implying their conversion to a common format) till the fusion of the extracted parts. The idea is to interoperate those resources keeping them independent, without changes or transformations, creating over them an integration layer that gives us a general overview, as the information slices were gathered. This is possible creating a semantic network, or a conceptual map, over the resources, which relates data items among them mapping each one to its different occurrences in the repository; formally speaking, that conceptual map corresponds to the ontology that describes the knowledge we want to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Metamorphosis, a Topic Maps oriented environment to extract data from heterogeneous information repositories and to generate a browser and conceptual navigator for the extracted knowledge.},

abstract = {SIGDOC comes from a technical writing tradition, where literature and rhetoric play an important role. Communication is now giving a broader focus, especially as influences come from graphical design, web design, digital sound or digital multimedia. In Lisbon, we expect to discuss this focus of SIGDOC. This is an important transition that is being done, without loosing its identity. In fact, from the revision process the heterogeneity of view point was identified. This is the result of including more participants from multimedia, computer science and graphical design.For the second time, SIGDOC will take place outside the American continent. For the first time it takes places in a non-English speaking country. It is the ideal place to discuss an important issue either for the technical documentation, either for software engineering or for design of communication communities: translation, internationalization, localization, and globalization.Bologna process is transforming and making an authentic revolution in the European university panorama. This may be faced either as a threat or as an opportunity. In this context, the discussion about a curriculum in design of communication is an important step that may be undertaken by the SIGDOC. It is a step that may contribute to its affirmation either in academia or in practitioner context.},

Fine-grained version control tools can provide a more detailed version control. However traditional tools and models provide very low flexibility and present high cost and impact of deployment in software development environments.

These decisions avoided the need to customize the editor and the toolchain, and simplified the creation of style sheets for the required output formats.A small documentation team of five writers maintains over 6300 topics and publishes documents, online helps, and training materials.

Web page structural elements (such as text, tables, links, and images) and their characteristics (such as colour and size) are used to determine the visual presentation and complexity level of a Web page. We theorise that by understanding a user's visual and aesthetic perception of a Web page we can understand the cognitive effort required for interaction with that page. This paper describes an investigation into user perception of the visual complexity and aesthetic appearance of Web pages. Results show a strong and high correlation between users' perception of visual complexity, structural elements (links, images, words and sections) and aesthetic appearance (organisation, clearness, cleanliness, interestingness and beautifulness) of a Web page. We argue that the results should be used as a further understanding for keeping the balance between aesthetic appearance of a Web page and its visual complexity. Web pages will then be designed that can still be aesthetically attractive but also usable and not overloaded with information for the users.},

abstract = {The desktop computer has been part of our work-life for a while. Even so many work situations do not consist solely of work at the desktop. Many other artefacts are used in changing configurations with and around the computer. Most user interface design has failed to recognize this, and accordingly we are still stuck with the idea that new design should replace existing artefacts, rather than exist together with them.Mobile technology makes it possible to work in many places, and current mobile technologies often seem to assume that as long as the individual user has access to all her personal documents on her laptop, she can work independently of place. This assumes that everybody would always want to carry along every document one has ever produced or received. And on top, many work settings are not about individual documents but presupposes a network-oriented shared use of documents and services across physical place. Furthermore, while moving about, and e.g. working from home, we face a blurring of the boundaries between work and other parts of life, as well as an ongoing reconfiguration of work and non-work technologies. How do we deal with changing configurations of the interfaces in particular such that cross between work and non-work? How do experiences with non-work technology influence work, and how do we deal with those experiences in design of work-place technology?My background for addressing these issues lies in activity theoretical HCI that helped bring focus "from human factors to human actors [1]." Focus was moved from individual work to groups working with a collection of applications. Theory focused on work settings and interaction within well-established communities of practice. Rigid guidelines, formal methods, and systematic testing were mostly abandoned for proactive methods such as a variety of participatory design workshops, prototyping and contextual inquiries. With the above challenges, we are about to make a next theoretical move, focusing on multiplicity, context, boundaries, experience and participation in a world of changing configurations of artefacts},

But two questions emerge: how can we improve a webpage's aesthetics and how can we evaluate this item? In order to solve this problem, we identified some of the theory that is underlying graphic design, gestalt theory and multimedia design. Based in the literature review, we proposed principles for web site design. We also propose a tool to evaluate web design.},

Because emotions play an essential role in human communication process, and they are naturally present in humans through body external signals, we think it is important to maintain them in the interface. Therefore in this paper we propose a Communication Design approach for the development of an interface that conveys the expression of emotion, through the use of multimedia contents.},

Our goal is to get an organized process to the design of multimodal interfaces that will let the designers to evaluate the interfaces with real users, find out usability issues and report the rationale to correct those issues. Moreover it will capture and store the acquired knowledge gathered during the multimodal interfaces design by using the design rationale (DR) and design patterns techniques.},
