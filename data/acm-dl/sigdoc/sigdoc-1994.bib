abstract = {Bell-Northern Research (BNR) is a global leader in the design and development of advanced telecommunications systems and products. Documentation and training groups at BNR have historically been autonomous; that is until last year. Both organizations have now integrated under one management team. With this association was the understanding that the new organization would encounter a number of problems; for example, differences concerning culture, processes, and functions.The basic premise of the new organization was to provide a more comprehensive service for our internal -BNR- customer base. To do this effectively, we needed an appropriate strategy to eliminate duplication of effort and reduce development interval time, and an organizational structure to accommodate our customer's requirements.To provide a more comprehensive and coordinated service to our customers, required a formalized and planning mechanism. We developed an Information Development Plan (IDP) as a method to capture the combined project plans for documentation and training.  At this point, the IDP has been used for about one year and will develop or evolve into a more integrated plan for our customer base.},

In particular, it takes an in depth look at one particular project.We found that many of the skills necessary for success as technical writers in the computer software industry are also important when designing user interfaces, and that the “self instruction” skills writers acquire can be applied to gaining other, more specialized user interface (UI) design skills. The resulting transfer and augmentation of skills enhances our value as technical communicators},

The past year has been a pivotal one in terms of access to simple and cost-effective tools and technologies that push “personal publishing” of CD-ROMs closer to reality for a whole range of publishers and information providers. This paper will review the development cycle of SPIE's first CD-ROM product, the Electronic Imaging '93 Proceedings on CD-ROM, a hybrid Windows/Macintosh disc that was created without the use of any of the proprietary (and often expensive) software royalty-based contracts that have been the established turn-key solution until now. The intent of this paper is to provide a first-hand look at the developmental, technical, and financial issues involved in creating a CD-ROM publication.},

They can be seen as multi-level documentation of the underlying architectures and processes, comprising both formal and informal elements, and allowing for the execution of their formal parts.These concepts are being validated in Macrotec, an environment for organizational modelling and analysis, which is complemented with Hypertec, a hypertext-based component supporting authoring, display and navigation of the documentation that cannot be captured in the formal part of our models. In this paper, we shall discuss Macrotec and Hypertec, illustrate our approach with an example and report on our experience at applying it.},

abstract = {This paper takes another look at information retrieval. It starts from the purposes of retrieval, looks at what people would like from a retrieval system, builds a conceptual model for how a retrieval system could work and from that determines what and how to do appropriate indexing to fit the model. The approach leads to the idea of the duality of indexing and retrieval. The ideas are illustrated by giving the design of a text based system and of a system to store pictures of faces. It is shown that the underlying mechanisms are the same for both systems and it suggests that other retrieval systems using this approach will have similar structures. Other implications of the approach are that retrieval and indexing can be monitored by the machine and the systems can learn to better respond to human needs. Ongoing research in this area is outlined.},

The perceived need to link our technical community electronically is both a response to a future scenario of pervasive interconnectivity among the scientific community and a need to address the issues raised by a changing paradigm for technical publishing, wherein the rise of electronic communication may obviate the need for the traditional publisher (and its capital investment). Through a growing but still modest effort over the last two years, SPIE has created an array of online services that are essentially paving the way for our organization's future offerings in the electronic publishing world. Many of our experiences and observations may apply to any group involved in setting up such a resource, and we hope this case study will provide some assistance to others embarking on that process.},
