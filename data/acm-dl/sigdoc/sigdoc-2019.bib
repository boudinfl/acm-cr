abstract = {Amateur game design communities are fruitful spaces for research in professional and technical communication (PTC) [9, 10, 16]; these communities often mirror many professional practices such as iterative design and the creation of extensive documentation. Before crossing into these spaces, however, researchers and practitioners must understand the makeup of these communities, which may (anecdotally) serve as potential spaces for marginalized people in ways the games industry does not. In this study, we used the International Game Developers' Association's Developer Satisfaction Survey as a base for our own surveys of three amateur game design communities. In mapping these communities, we found that each mirrored the games industry in several categories, but that each community also displayed unique differences that necessitate a variety of approaches to conducting research in or on such sites.},

abstract = {User-created guides, or the "do-it-yourself" (DIY) genre of online procedural discourse, offer their audience access to vital knowledge while allowing them to bypass traditional gatekeeping mechanisms. Some vulnerable communities must further subvert or "hack" institutions to gain access to information that they need to survive exclusive or oppressive policies. In this article, we present original data in an effort to legitimize the work these communities have done while also challenging the boundaries of what constitutes successful design. Edenfield shares his research of medical information-sharing practices of DIY hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for trans individuals. Ledbetter's study of YouTube's beauty community involved collecting and analyzing user-generated makeup tutorials on YouTube as well as interviewing women who self-identify as members of the community. Both studies prompt a reconsideration of what it means to create successful instructional guides. We suggest strategies for avoiding institutional appropriation of these communities' work and for identifying community spaces and the borders that can protect the wellbeing of marginalized individuals.},

By analyzing shifts in audience theory, it defines a distributed network audience (DNA) theory reconfiguring the boundaries of what an audience is for digital composition. It draws upon distributed usability of user network influences for redefining audience and how that audience affects local and hypermediated networks of both human and nonhuman actors. Further, this paper offers insights for teaching this audience concept to maximize the impact of digital communication designs. It posits that we may appeal to conventional, positive multimedia experiences, design responsively to accommodate user participation, provide clear, learnable, memorable, and usable communications, curate connections between distributed resources, and shape nonhuman references to support and constrain communication. Therefore, this paper formulates a framework for a distributed network audience theory that reassembles many of the sociocultural and technological boundaries of technical audiences and offers new teachable directions.},

abstract = {While crucial infrastructures in the United States and similar countries are increasingly in conditions of crisis and decay, people living in these countries often lack a shared understanding of these systems from which to imagine the kind of radical change that theorists such as Lauren Berlant have argued is needed. As recent political controversies make clear, this lack of shared understanding extends to national infrastructures such as borders and points of entry. However, like all infrastructures, these are complex sociotechnical objects that challenge simple understanding. Collectively debating future infrastructure is complex and feels, in the present moment, insurmountable. At the same time, reimagining these systems for more equitable futures is crucial.Drawing on theories from a range of fields including anthropology and design, this paper considers the communication systems that might support broad groups with the shared understandings needed to debate the futures of infrastructures. It first describes a series of events in early 2017 related to the increased search and seizure of personal electronic devices at United States airports. It then analyzes the online comments left in response to articles about these events, arguing that the comments demonstrate both the tracing of existing infrastructures and the imagining of new infrastructures. Implications from this analysis include the potential of including speculation as a value that could be formally recognized by evaluation systems and the need to carefully consider how expert knowledge about present infrastructures is communicated alongside more future-oriented commentary.},

abstract = {This research report details how collaborative research teams used a mixed-methods research and design process to iterate and improve student food insecurity online portals and to better position the university to more directly address both student resiliency goals and unsustainable university community behaviors. Earlier student research teams collected data on potential interventions to increase broadly-identified student sustainability behaviors (behaviors like recycling, using mass transit, and reducing water use and food waste) through two semester-long diary studies. Diary studies revealed student ambivalence about being tasked with documenting personal sustainability behaviors while also trying to improve personal economic and social well-being. In order to foster awareness and improvement of student sustainability, collaborative facultystaff-student design teams reframed the sustainability intervention prompt into a student resiliency enquiry. Based on lessons learned from the student diary studies and institutional longitudinal attitude surveys, the staff-faculty-student teams designed student resiliency research to investigate the more immediate nutritional needs of at-risk students. Faculty and staff researchers asked student researchers to measure student user perceptions, attitudes, and activity to uncover how students navigate food insecurity. Student research teams processed the longitudinal survey data, collected user research data, and ideated solutions to student food insecurity through sketch-boards and interactive mockups. By turning the tools of UX research and design to locate opportunities for improving student experiences, research teams were able to successfully reframe the problem space in a way that would bypass questions of epideictic moral evaluation, and would instead enlist participants in defining the forensic qualities of the problem. Researchers discovered opportunities to solve scarcity problems that can both be described as rooted in sustainability and resiliency. The iterative, mixed-methods research approach invited greater participant understanding and consent by investigating preferred participant conceptual frameworks, and adopting a framework that acknowledged concerns that predominate participants' lived experience.},

abstract = {Open video game development systems provide a useful model for designing an engaging user experience (UX) research project. While UX research has typically framed people simultaneously as research subjects and users of a technology, some work has also problematized each of these categorizations. For instance, UX practitioners have questioned the framing of people as generic users, and participatory design has repositioned participants as co-owners of the results of research. This article offers a complimentary perspective by applying the concept of user roles to the activity of participation in open development. Open development, which is the prolonged process where incomplete games are publicly released and iterated on based on player feedback, is fundamentally a UX research process. In open development projects, user-participants adopt a variety of roles, including acting as consumers, players, bug reporters, player support services, community moderators, reviewers, developer advocates, playtesters, quality assurance testers, content creators, and ideators. This paper builds definitions for the user-participant roles and offers examples from the online forums for an open development game. Finally, it argues that we can design communications systems to support these roles.},

abstract = {User interfaces are continually evolving. Contemporary interfaces, particularly mobile interfaces, have developed their own design language as they have discarded skeuomorphs and metaphorical representations to support their design and introduced features not available before in desktop interfaces. Despite the pervasiveness of mobile interfaces, researchers have neglected the development of theory that accounts for how they still connect with or deviate from early interface design constructs. This paper adapts the notion of metaphorical tension to formulate and explore a new construct, design tension, which scopes an exercise of interaction criticism on Instagram's interface. As a result, this paper argues that design tension is useful to account for how interface components introduce features that are discordant to interface standards and best practices, things from the real world, and the user's belief system. It also suggests that both the method and construct can be applied to other communication design artifacts distinct from interfaces to produce intermediate-level knowledge.},

The age of the participants is skewed towards children and the gender of the participant sample is predominantly male. The studies combine mixed-methods, including observations, interviews, and usability evaluations. The participants include end users, as well as caregivers and practitioners. Neurodiversity is prevalent, and emerging technologies are promising to assist neurodiverse individuals in their daily activities. Despite the importance of involving neurodiverse users in the technology design, guidance for investigators to conduct inclusive studies is currently limited.

One of their big challenges refers to the adoption of mobile games by older adults. Appropriated methods for usability, accessibility and user experience (UX) evaluation of such domain remains a few in the literature. Engineering methods are still required for startup companies to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we sought to build evaluation methods for the context of startups, mobile games and older adults. This study is an empirical research based on techniques from the constructivist grounded theory methodology. Our findings show a lean framework aiming to guide startup practitioners to diagnose usability, accessibility and UX issues from tests of mobile games with older adults. We also provide a guide to usability and accessibility heuristics that can be employed to inspect the domain.},

Parents and legal guardians have striven to protect the privacy of their owns. However, current approaches for privacy control still lack usability for lay people. In this paper, we have explored the use of Card Sorting to enhance the usability of a privacy control for smart toys. Our goal was to identify and describe benefits of this technique to the design of more usable privacy controls. For this reason, we conducted a case study with voluntarily participants. We chose a parental control model from the literature to be the subject of evaluation for the experiment. Therefore, we extracted 19 units of information from its interface, and put them into cards for the Card Sorting evaluation. After the experiment, we obtained 30 valid responses. From these responses we performed a cluster analysis to understand the best alternative to group privacy related contents. Our contributions include a new model for nutrition label style mobile parental privacy controls for smart toys, suggestion of Google Material Design icons to be applied as indication for groups of privacy policies and, finally, a six steps process to perform Card Sorting with cluster analysis that does not rely on users' discussions to compose the Information Architecture hierarchy.},

Participants followed a think-aloud protocol during both observations, explaining the steps that they were taking and sharing their thought process and feelings with the researcher.

These comment points abstractly link to software documentation, which is stored separately from the source code but remains maintainable from the source code using traditional software development tools and workflows, or using documentation focused tools like wikis. By treating documentation as a cross-cutting concern of source code, we intend to increase the modularity of documentation. This, in turn, allows different documentation concerns to be supported without mixing those concerns. Examples of such concerns include documentation associated with the architectural design, articulated requirements for the software, a literate description of algorithms, external developer API documentation, accessibility of international documentation, and pedagogical exposition.},

Drawing from interviews with 13 participants, we constructed a heuristic that identifies six tensions community-engaged researchers (CERs) often negotiate through their research stance: (1) embodiment and identity, (2) access and relationships, (3) interventions and actions, (4) institutions and disciplinarity, (5) intentions and outcomes, and (6) disclosure and write-up. CERs described the tensions as concurrent, noting that shifting commitments, liminality, and time were factors that span categories. These findings underscore the necessity of opening spaces in disciplinary and institutional contexts to value and recognize intellectual work associated with CER such as trust building, boundary negotiation, methodological construction, and relationship maintenance.},

The purpose of such experience report is to outline a framework for establishing a shared understanding of global UX. The framework relies on inclusive design as a guiding philosophy and is based on my experience developing and teaching a global UX course in an undergraduate UX program. This paper briefly outlines the purpose and key topics of a global UX course at [school name omitted intentionally].

The documents and data we use are a suite of cloud computing services provided by Baidu Cloud. The report begins with an introduction of the research goal; following reviews on the related work, it then lays out the design of the experiments with user data collected from Baidu Cloud. In our experiments, we categorize all documents into three groups and try to identify which metrics would affect documentation quality most.

Apart from the high level of difficulty of manual assessments of accessibility in RIAs, such applications lack automatic tools that support the process. The dynamic nature of web content leads to the updating of automated tools to include techniques that identify and classify the several components that comprise RIAs. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art and limitations of current automatic tools that assess the accessibility of RIAs, and presents a meta-review of multidisciplinary techniques towards motivating research on improvements in such tools. The study contributes to the availability of accessible RIAs for disabled users, which include components with recent technologies and innovative features in web interfaces.},

abstract = {The increasing use of AI-powered chatbots has been transforming how technical communicators interact with users, content, and technologies. Menu-based, rule-based, or AI-powered, chatbots help automate customer service and technical support while moving away from more traditional web- or app-based frameworks. This panel explores how technical communicators design, teach, and evaluate chatbots before discussing lessons about user research, usability testing, information architecture, and new competencies that have to be introduced to prepare technical communication students to work toward/with useful and usable automated content.},

abstract = {Small clinics in low-middle-income countries frequently lack the financial and technical resources to support patient-record automation---relying instead on paper records to track patient visits. Earlier successes introducing automated solutions into these clinics often eroded quickly after external support was withdrawn. The piClinic Console is designed to automate key aspects of patient information management in small, limited-resource clinics so as to introduce automation into a clinic in a way that the clinic can sustain with little or no additional support. Unlike previous efforts to scale down existing medical records systems for a small clinic, the piClinic Console was developed to include only the functions that benefit most from automation. The design was implemented to work on low-cost hardware to minimize initial cost and dependence on external support. After encouraging laboratory test results, this design was tested in four Honduran clinics to evaluate the users' experiences and the utility of the design. Clinic response was universally positive; however, field testing identified that success relied on accommodating the different roles in the clinic, supporting at least one printer, and enabling multiple users to access the system from multiple devices.},

abstract = {Communication scholars employ metaphors to illustrate the ways that knowledge is produced in professional contexts. This poster argues that current metaphors casting professional texts in ecological and economical terms deserve reevaluation. To do this, it uses a content analysis of ethnographic notes from "ride-along" sessions and interviews with police officers in a mid-sized Midwestern town to construct a model of how law enforcement officers use technology to generate criminal evidence while on patrol. The model, which emphasizes the importance of "space" and "authority" in addition to traditional ecological metaphors of scope and time, is displayed in a graphical flow-chart that illustrates the capture, transmittal, and storage of this evidence. By illuminating these processes, it not only provides a clearer understanding of the role that these concepts play in genre ecologies, but also points to the complex ways that professional ecologies impart meaning to professional texts in the criminal justice system --- for better and for worse.},

Two years later in September 2017, Puerto Rico underwent category five hurricane Maria, killing an estimate of 800 to 8000 people and displacing hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans [1]. This poster presents preliminary results from a comparative study of Nepal's and Puerto Rico's networked communities who used crisis communication practices to address the havoc created by the disaster. This mixed methods research uses assemblage theory and comparative rhetorics to argue that disasters create situations where networked communities emerge with innovative digital composition practices.},

abstract = {This research project is built around empirical observations and interviews conducted with expert letterpress typesetters in the United States. These observations and interviews focused on participants' composition processes, placing fine-grained analysis of their observable habits and actions in the context of their explanations of these habits and actions. Observation and interview data was collected and analyzed with the goal of describing "intra-actions" [1] present in the relationship between human and machine. Preliminary results show evidence of a wide variety of intra-actions, including the following: habits and actions based on a desire for efficiency, a cyclical composing process, a concern for correctness, and a deference to letterpress printing's history. By taking seriously the ways in which the traditional concept of agency has been complicated by new materialist and posthuman theories, this study looks for ways to diversify and improve research methods for understanding how humans engage in the complex design activities that is writing. If the user is adding any new data, they should make sure to style it as per the instructions provided in previous sections.},
