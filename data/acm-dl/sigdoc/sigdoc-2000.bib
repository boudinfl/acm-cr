title = {Web Site Design: A Case Study in Usability Testing Using Paper Prototypes},
year = {2000},
isbn = {0780364317},
publisher = {IEEE Educational Activities Department},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Paper prototypes are a low-tech, low-cost, but highly effective,
form of usability testing for web site design. Creating a web site
is relatively easy, given the technology and tools now available.
All too often, web site developers tend to be enamored with the
technology and forget the needs of end user. As a result, many web
site developers delay usability testing until their web site is
completely designed, only to uncover significant interface,
content, or structural problems with the site once the customers
try to use it. Significant redesign may be impossible due to time,
cost, or personnel constraints.This paper discusses the benefits of
using paper prototypes to conduct usability testing of a web site
for Mercer University's School of Engineering Center for Excellence
in Engineering Education (CE3). These benefits include
the following: 

1. Low cost, both in terms of time and materials required to
create the prototype;2. Critical feedback from users, who appear more willing to
suggest significant flaws when the site design is obviously very
rough;3. Willingness on the part of the designers to change the
design, since they have invested minimal time and effort into
creating a paper prototype; and ultimately4. Improved usability.

.This paper also discusses how to create a paper prototype, how to
conduct a usability test with the prototype, and what to do with
the test results. This process can be used to enhance the usability
of any web site.The design of the CE3 is a project of a
team of senior technical communication students in the Department
of Technical Communication at Mercer University. This paper also
discusses the importance of training technical communicators to be
user advocates.},

abstract = {This paper introduces low-tech simulation as a technique for testing procedures and their documentation. The key idea is to test the interface-procedure-documentation set in the early stages of development, where changes can be still be made easily, using extremely low-cost simulation materials. Using this low-tech method, developers can test and improve the usability of documentation for user interfaces that are still being designed. An extended example, revolving a new aircraft cockpit interface for text-based air-traffic control communication, presents a look at the low-tech approach in use. An evaluation of low-tech simulation shows that the approach was practical. Qualitative analysis indicates that low-tech evaluation produces results that are different from those obtained using the cognitive walkthrough for operating procedures and similar to those obtained using traditional high-tech simulation.},

abstract = {The practice of technical communication, especially for professionals just entering the workplace, is rapidly changing. Companies have higher expectations for degrees in technical communication, a strong foundation in technology, and the ability to function on cross-disciplinary teams alongside technical experts in the design and development process. As the practice of technical communication shifts its focus, academics have the responsibility to be certain that technical communication degree programs have a strong component of such topics as engineering design, programming, human factors, usability, instructional design, and project management, in addition to traditional communication skills. Academic programs have lagged behind practice, largely due to the location of degree programs, departmental reward systems, faculty deficiencies in technology, little depth in fields beyond rhetoric, and lack of exposure to best industry practices. This paper addresses these issues and makes some practical recommendations for catching academe up to practice.},

abstract = {Recent transformations in engineering education accreditation have shifted emphasis away from simple counting of required courses to a focus on the documentation of student learning outcomes. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology's (ABET) Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC 2000) demands that engineering programs show evidence of eleven skills in their students. Only five of these skills relate to a student's technical abilities. The remaining six define what have been called "soft" skills, and it is this shift in emphasis that will have a significant impact on technical communication programs and pedagogy. In essence, EC 2000 has redefined both who is responsible for developing students' communication skills and for documenting evidence of student learning outcomes. Given the changes at the accreditation level, transformations within technical communication departments that serve engineering programs are inevitable. These changes offer problems as well as benefits for technical communication faculty.},

A campus in a system of for-profit post-secondary DeVry Institutes is employed as an example of the benefits of organizing physical space of educational activities in an integrated manner. Educators, support staff and technical resources are brought together across the range of the institution's educational offerings, creating by the campus as "open space" the conditions for successful informal teams in institutions of higher learning.},

These politics of organization, classification, division and association are intensified as the pressures on our groups to successfully work toward any goal also increase. (Baecker, 1993) Therefore, we react to organizational and goal-driven pressures by making even finer distinctions about who is "inside" our group and who is "outside." These distinctions in turn define the world for us and lead us to make projections (either accurate, or inaccurate) about the obstacles we must overcome, and lead us to consider who might get in the way of our goals. These types of social/political distractions help us establish who is "with" us and who is "against" us.},

abstract = {An increasing amount of information is being disseminated to decision-makers via web interfaces. Because there is also an increase in the use of personal digital assistants (PDA's), future web sites must accommodate handheld access. With easy ability to synchronize content from the web with handheld systems, basic web design assumptions should be reexamined to determine how handheld's affect search and retrieval. The small screen size, text-based design, and cumbersome interface manipulation requires verification of the current design guidelines to ensure they support efficient information retrieval. In addition, PDA users' browsing behaviors also differ from typical Web use. Whereas people using the Web tend to engage in open-ended, exploratory behaviors, PDA's are intended to support task-specific use. Thus user ability to retrieve information---including locating and relocating information, building mental models of the website, and remembering the information once the user has found it---may differ in substantive ways. This paper lays out a theoretical framework for understanding differences between handheld and full-sized web environments, as well as their intended uses. Design issues are identified for further research.},

However, the road to that destination is traveled by a wide variety of users and is filled with many obstacles. Even after you have arrived at your destination, there are still many surprises in store for you. As the designer/developer of the Web site, as well as an employee of the company, you may naively assume you know your audience very well. After all, you are a member of the same audience! This dual role of audience member and designer is both a strength and a weakness. You may be tempted to take your users for granted and assume that you know what's best for them. This paper emphasizes the importance of knowing your audience and the need for iterative design and usability testing; it also presents the reactions of your users to the design that you so carefully tested with them prior to implementation. No matter how carefully you plan and how well you think you know your users and have anticipated their needs, their responses to your well-crafted product will never cease to amaze you. Often, there is a problem in the interpretation of the requirements - maybe you didn't really implement exactly what the users had in mind or you provided them with what you assumed was an acceptable compromise. In these situations, you have to accept the responsibility and decide what to do next. However, the users of your product, in this case a Web site, also have some responsibilities. This paper discusses the responsibilities of both designers and users.},

If this base site is done correctly the next phase of growth is more like an explosion.The user base of these Intranets is also evolving. Today's corporations consist of a wider variety of employees than ever before. A typical business division will include office-based employees in various locations, telecommuting home-based employees, contract employees, and consultants. This type of business environment can lead to a lack of communication and lack of company loyalty.

It outlines ways in which writers can use their writing skills to collaborate with and add value to the HCI (human computer interaction) and software architecture functions. It also points to areas that writers need to explore further to discover the ways in which they can contribute meaningfully to information, and therefore product, development throughout the life cycle of the software product. It uses real-life examples to illustrate ways in which writers can transform documentation from an item on the laundry list of deliverables into an effective design and development tool.},

abstract = {This paper describes ongoing work to apply software engineering methods to the production of hypermedia technical documentation for safety critical application areas. Technical documentation is an increasingly important application area for hypermedia. In industries such as aerospace the economic drivers for widespread adoption of online hypermedia are very strong. One of the major issues in hypermedia design in these applications areas is the lack of rigorous design methods which would allow guarantees of correctness to be made. Current work on 'industrial strength' hypermedia has tended to concentrate on issues of system robustness or database query techniques. This work is directed at document systems which are designed as a coherent whole, to provide means of specifying and validating such documents by application of formal methods, allowing mathematical proofs to be made. These methods, in themselves, are not adequate, since they are accessible only to software engineers. A usable method must be accessible to document designers and software engineers. A 'formal storyboard' notation has been devised which has proven to be usable by those trained in hypermedia design and translates directly into the process algebra CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems). The method has the potential to address at least one of the major problems impeding the use of hypermedia in technical documentation supporting safety critical industries.},

We have learned the necessity for employing careful planning and "mature" project management practices to produce documents that match the needs of our users. On the other hand, we face the reality of "web time," wherein those users expect us to deliver information faster than previous methods have allowed. We cannot simply abandon practices that have proven to work; indeed, we have seen the consequences of simply slapping existing paper documents onto the web.Each organization in each industry will have to determine how much to truncate the proven project management standards. Perhaps one model for doing so is the "just good enough, just in time" mode, which will allow us to deliver information products that work, and to do so quickly, with the understanding that we can improve them continually after initial delivery.},

If the publication states that a particular device will work at such and such speeds, then this statement must be substantiated - somewhere. Systems must be tested and claims validated. Test plans and test procedures are poorly understood by many technical writers, and the need for good plans and procedures is critical in industry.This paper develops the definition of good test plans, test procedures, data collection, and the legal aspects of what is said about a new product versus what can be proven through product testing.},

We attempt to determine if and how the recommended changes from the usability test were implemented, to identify other changes made to the feature being designed, and to determine the source of those other changes. Based on our findings in this case study, we can say that the usability test findings and recommendations had a great impact on the design of the feature, and the design was also influenced by seven other sources.},

abstract = {Writers often have to create documents for different audiences, for
different media (e.g., web, Help, training), for different
products, and for different platforms. Single sourcing information
can help writers to accommodate all possible uses and audiences.
Single sourcing involves identifying all information requirements
up front, then developing them from a single source. All
information products required by a particular project (e.g.,
brochures, user guides, training materials, online Help, external
web site) are created from the single file, hence the name--single
sourcing.In single sourcing, writers break information down to the
element level (e.g., section, paragraph, sentence, even phrases and
words), then write and compile all elements into a single source
file. The power of single sourcing lies in effectively reusing
information elements--whether they're paragraphs, procedures, or
sentences--over and over again. Information models identify to
writers all the required elements, how to structure them, and how
to reuse them. This paper describes the process of information
modeling, including: 

analyzing audiences and their needsanalyzing information to determine the structure and
contentbuilding the model both at the product and the element

abstract = {Cognitive load theory can inform the design of web-based instruction. The basic premise of cognitive load theory is that the focus of an instructional module must be the instruction itself. Information that is adjunct to the instruction must be designed to minimize cognitive load and enhance working memory. Because the mental resources of working memory can be overloaded, any information that ignores cognitive load may interfere with the process of acquiring knowledge and skills. Instruction that effectively presents the learning to our working memory has an impact on our ability to store knowledge and skills in our long-term memory. Everything that we "know" is held in our long-term memory. Our team applied the principles of cognitive load theory to the design our instructional web site and discovered that cognitive load theory provides a sound baseline for the design of effective web-based instruction. Further, to effectively enhance web-based instruction, the graphical user interface and multimedia formats must be developed in consideration of cognitive load principles.},

This program is currently used for a self-paced, computer based, Internet mediated course at Northeastern University in Boston. This tool is interactive and permits the learner to develop listening skills by experimentation and practice.

Extending Media Richness Theory, we describe the multiplicity of communication situations these teams faced in terms of group management, interpersonal work, task work, and tools/media issues. We suggest that despite differences between the teams in both performace, communication, and situation, common patterns emerged in which each media type appeared to afford a distinct characteristic mix of communication. For both teams, email was dominated by exchanges on topics of group management; application-sharing/chat environments were dominated by exchanges over task work. Based on these results concerning emergent patterns of media use, we offer predictions concerning media use in collaboration at a distance and suggest some practical guidelines for those interested in supporting such work effectively.},

abstract = {As the new century opens, work processes have been reengineered, shifting from Tayloristic models of sequential specialization toward work processes that are concurrent and multidisciplinary. This shift in work processes put a premium on design collaborations in which members of project teams go beyond the simple coordination of still individualistic work to engage in joint activity aimed at the co-construction of "collective work products. " In this paper, we outline five basic characteristics emerging from a small but important body of work describing design collaboration. We then go on to suggest why most common collaborative technologies provide poor support for these characteristics, although recent trends are moving in promising directions. We conclude by outlining four criteria which technological mediation for design collaboration must meet in order to effectively support this new kind of work practice. These criteria can assist practitioners in evaluating the ever changing and ever increasing number of collaborative technologies.},

abstract = {This paper provides guidelines for writing HTML help content for end users of Apple hardware and software products. The guidelines were developed by the editors in Apple Computer's Instructional Products (IP) group to respond to the problems that arose as documentation shifted from print books to HTML help. Initially, writers struggled to "retrofit" their print content for the onscreen environment. However, the differences in how users interact with print and onscreen help demanded not just a small revision, but a major rethinking of the instructional content. Looking to minimalist principles for guidance, we created these guidelines to help writers develop content that supported the goal of Apple's HTML help: to help users get tasks done without slowing them down or getting in their way.},

abstract = {Procedural instructions that consist of only a sequence of steps will probably be executable, but nevertheless "meaningless" to users of technical devices. This paper discusses three features that can make procedural instructions more meaningful: adding functional coordinating information, adding information about the use of the technical device in real life, and adding operational information about how the device works. The research literature supports the effectiveness of the first feature, but offers little evidence that real life elements enhance understanding of instructions. As for operational information, the research suggests that users are willing to read it, and that it contributes to better understanding and performance in the long term, but only if it is closely related to the procedure. As a conclusion, we propose a theoretical framework that assumes three levels of mental representation of instructions: syntactical, semantic, and situational.},

With Elucidative Programming we are primarily concerned with documentation of program understanding, and presentation of such understanding on the World Wide Web. In a broader perspective, we are interested in support of any technical writing which needs to address source program constituents. We claim that Elucidative Programming may be helpful for these purposes, mainly due to a documentation model based on relations between places in the documentation and program constituents. The main section in the paper introduces a concrete Elucidator tool for Java. We use this tool as outset for a discussion of collaboration and teamwork centered in WWW based program presentations.},

abstract = {The rapid development of reusable software components results in an information-overload problem in the development process. Software developers must read large amounts of documentation. Adaptive documentation is one way to address this problem and support efficient reading. However, in our view, adaptive documentation requires a writing process that delivers the pedagogical strategies for adaptivity. In this paper, we take stance in a project on adaptive software reference documentation and discuss the requirements on writing. We also discuss writing trends and Web languages in relation to adaptivity. We conclude that describing change in documentation is not supported on an authoring level but rather on a programming level.},

As solutions, we propose graph types and usage templates.The edge types and inheritance of the proposed graph type model are useful modeling tools. We give examples for structures that can be expressed more precisely and with gain for the author using graph structures. There are also graphical tools available to define graph types and to specify operations on graphs.Templates can be used as a simple parameterization mechanism. A template illustrates the usual usage of a substructure, as opposed to the minimal one required by a structure definition, or the maximal one allowed by it.We also present a prototype authoring application based on these ideas.},

abstract = {As software becomes increasingly modular and componentized, giving users more control over what components they install and use, the challenge of creating useful, task-based navigation hierarchies becomes more complex. Help navigation needs to reflect the tasks a user can actually perform, given the components that were installed. This presents organizational and writing challenges for writers and technical challenges for help delivery systems. This paper examines a number of existing and possible future ways of implementing document navigation in a componentized software product and recommends approaches for future projects.},

We are investigating this by first gathering a collection of background material on the topic. In addition to collecting background material, we are designing and carrying out a study of individuals playing computer games. From the reading that we have done, and the preliminary design of our study, we have created four hypotheses to test. The background material for this study, the experimental design, and our hypotheses are all discussed below.},

abstract = {Software developers have used version control systems for years, to manage source code changes and to enable them to reproduce any given level of their software from the source code that created it. Most writing departments, however, tend to perform full-scale weekly backups at best, or tempt fate at worst. The two major reasons for this neglect of document version control are lack of adequate tools and the effort required by writers to deal with the inadequate tools presently available. This paper describes a tool I developed at IBM, the Automated Backup Manager (ABM), which attempts to connect the writer's documentation to a true source version control system, without reducing writer productivity.},

publisher = {IEEE Educational Activities Department},
address = {USA},
abstract = {DSTOP, the Design Support Tool for Operating Procedures, is a relatively simple software tool for support of designers of new interfaces and their procedures for use. DSTOP is based on two complementary models: the documentation coherence maxims and the situated-act model, which distinguishes domain actions from interface actions. Use of the tool involves the writing of operating procedures using a kind of grid, where the operating procedure runs from top to bottom and is divided horizontally into why, what and how elements. The why element represents the operating procedure's goal; the what represents the operating procedure's situated act; and the how represents the interface action(s) required to effectuate the act. The tool has been used to develop prototype operating procedures for computer-based aircraft cockpit interfaces. DSTOP adds new functionality associated with the coherence maxims, including explicit representation of variants of terms, and explicit tracking and display of procedures (and their why-what-how components) in which any of the variants is used.},

These projects have investigated the possibilities HTML documentation offer for creating end user documentation that is more than simple step-by-step instructions; documentation that is used on a regular basis by the end users and that has multiple applications in the work environment.

Although we may never develop universal design standards that apply to every situation, we need more empirically supported guidelines to inform design decisions. Guidelines must be based on commonly shared semiology of Web conventions. A semiotics of the Web can help us determine how meaning is derived from Web pages and the Web, and in turn how to better design sites to convey intended and desired meanings. This article identifies six categories or dimensions of design issues relating to the Web that serves as a beginning of a Web semiotics. Each dimension is explained, with various research issues and questions suggested.},

Paper copies were used for internal document review and approval. And once each week, paper updates on products and services were gathered, copied, collated, and mailed to OCLC-affiliated regional networks (distributors).Motivation for a document management system included the growth of the OCLC membership, the reduction in time lines for development of new products, and OCLC's committment to seek ISO certification.
