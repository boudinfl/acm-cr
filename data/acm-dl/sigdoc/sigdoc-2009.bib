abstract = {User interface design and development activities are typically costly and, despite many research efforts, still lack adequate support tools to make them more efficient. The use of guidelines and principles have been mostly replaced by the use of user interface design patterns, collected in libraries that aim to encompass both general and domain-specific user interface design knowledge. However, such patterns are represented mostly in natural language and other representations that cannot be easily computed. This paper presents an approach to represent user interface design patterns in a knowledge base which, by bringing together semi-structured user interface design patterns and design rationale models, can help designers to search, compare, and reuse proven design solutions in their projects.},

abstract = {Texts are the media content primarily available on Web sites and applications. However, this heavy use of texts creates an accessibility barrier to those who cannot read fluently in their mother tongue due to both text length and linguistic complexity. To offer an accessible alternative to these readers, shorter and simplified versions of text content should be provided. Taking that into consideration, this paper introduces Facilita, an assistive technology to help lower-literacy users to understand the text content of Web applications. Facilita generates an accessible content from Web pages automatically, using summarization and simplification techniques. It is also important to consider interface design requirements, since Facilita's target audience (the functionally illiterate) is often classified as computer illiterate as well. Thus, interaction and user interface design were developed considering the limitations and skills of the functionally illiterate.},

abstract = {Recently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) upgraded its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from version 1.0 to 2.0. WCAG 2.0 further encourages the design of accessible Web content, and has been put in place to address the limitations of the earlier version, WCAG 1.0. The new development requires that updates be made accordingly. One of the areas affected by the transition is automated Web content accessibility evaluation and repair. Since most Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools (AERTs) depend on guidelines to make suggestions about potential accessibility barriers and proffer repair solutions, existing tools have to be modified to accommodate the changes WCAG 2.0 brings. In particular, more techniques for performing automated Web content accessibility evaluation and repair are desirable. The heterogeneous nature of Web content which AERTs assess, calls for techniques of cross-disciplinary origin. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the transition for automated evaluation and repair. In addition, we present a meta-review of relevant techniques from related disciplines for the purpose of informing research that surrounds testing and repair techniques employed by AERTs.},

abstract = {Designers often strive to meet the requirements of the "average user." Unfortunately even if they manage to achieve their goal, this mythical user does not exist resulting in a gap between each actual user and the technology they receive. As technology cannot be designed for every individual it needs to be adaptable for as many people as possible.A framework has been developed to identify similarities between user-groups and the assistive technology they use, with the aim of catering for different users with minimum alteration to the technology. The framework takes a holistic view and can be used to describe either a person or a technology, initially focusing on six sections (Cognition, Senses, Output, General Health, Mobility and Context) identified using the model of a human body. The sections are then compared to identify patterns and areas of importance.Using each of the sections of the framework separately provides a complete picture of a technology or user allowing better profilling, improving accessibility. Bringing the framework together by comparing the sections against each other allows the design team to better understand the dynamics of the technology or user and the potential for communication using different media and mechanisms.},

Although there is awareness of the importance of the quality of these specific elements to ensure usability, existing usability evaluation methods fail to provide designers with inspection principles to specifically assess the semiotics aspects for web interfaces. This experience report illustrates and discusses the development of an initial set of heuristics and procedural tools aimed at guiding the semiotics inspection of large, information-intensive websites, as a separate concern from the other design dimensions, extensively covered in the usability literature. The semiotics heuristics defined represent a complementary toolkit to the existing usability methods.},

The communication impact is empirically investigated by eliciting and modeling the brand values that the website tries to convey and assessing whether and how much they are perceived by the intended target users. Results from two case studies show that simple and readable indicators can be constructed to identify flaws in the communication of the brand values and support designers and stakeholders to devise precise strategies to improve the design accordingly.},

The subjects' overall rates of success with trial-and-error were higher than with help. We present trends of use of the approaches across the four tasks, review the apparent causes of success and failure when using the approaches, and develop an affordance-knowledge model that helps to explain people's preference for muddling through over using help. We conclude by discussing the model's implications for developers of systems and writers of help.},

abstract = {Existing web-based help systems that provide interactive real-time assistance to end-users exhibit considerable limitations. Some of these limitations are related to the presence of invasive features in these systems, the asynchronous activities between the end-user and the technical support staff during a task-related help session, and the application-specific nature of these systems. The latter limitation in particular restricts the portability of these web-based help systems to other web applications. Despite advances in web development paradigms such as the workflow-based Model View Controller (MVC), and key technology ingredients such as synchronous web annotation services, we have not found any work that combines these technologies to address the above mentioned limitations. In this work we have designed and implemented a web-based help system as an abstract layer that can be seamlessly integrated with the architectural layers of any web application that is instantiated using the workflow-based MVC development paradigm. This layer uses the use cases of the instantiated application to ensure that task-related activities are synchronized during a help session. Our web-based help system also includes features to deliver instructive aids to end-users in the form of visual web annotations. In this paper we describe, using an example, the design and implementation of our system, discuss its limitations, and recommend directions for future work.},

We have developed a sonification scheme to describe static software entities in Java programs, and we show that it is useful in static program comprehension, notably concerning low-level architecture. The scheme is implemented via a tool in which an Eclipse IDE is integrated with a CSound synthesis engine. The tool is intended for use by sighted software developers in a static browsing/editing environment.A validation study of the concept has been performed via one-on-one sessions with experienced software developers. Preliminary results indicate that software developers are easily able to learn and recognize sonified characteristics of software entities and their relationships by listening to sequences of mapped sound constructs. Identification of specific entities is more problematic. Developers have indicated that they would find the tool useful during both exploration and more focused programming activities. Their additional perceptions have been collected using grounded qualitative means.},

abstract = {One of the major issues for user assistance systems consists of "providing help at an appropriate level". In this paper we analyze the problem of modeling task experience - a prerequisite for provisioning adequate help. In contrast to level-based approaches we propose an ontology-based model, which allows fine-grained modeling of task experience using the concepts of the task domain as granules. The model is semantic in the sense that it allows to take advantage of the relations between concepts to provide novel semantic services and interactions. We present the SACHS (Semantic Annotations for a Controlling Help System, a semantic help system for a spreadsheet-based financial controlling system) software as an exemplary application of the proposed task experience model.},

In this paper, we analyze audiovisual recordings of people using a computer application, to identify (1) transition patterns among problem-solving approaches, and (2) the frequency of these transitions. Our analysis indicates that people switch frequently between consulting help and exploring the interface. Switching between problem-solving approaches appears to be an effective way of succeeding in tasks. Applications and their help systems can be better designed to support users who switch between help and non-help approaches to solving problems.},

Design charrettes are intense periods of design activity most commonly associated with architectural and environmental studies. I have adapted design charrettes in order to achieve particular learning outcomes in multimedia design courses. This paper is a theoretical reflection on using charrettes to teach the design process. The pedagogy behind my use of charrettes is informed by socio-cognitive learning theories. In my multimedia design courses, graduate students participate in charrette activities to experience the design process, to collaborate in project-based design activities, to seek a range of solutions to design problems, and to gain mastery of design research techniques.},

abstract = {A continuous priority for technical writers is to increase user comprehension of concepts and statistical information in technical documentation. Improvements in the written language such as consistent terminology, use of an established writing style, accurate indexing, advanced search capabilities, and so on, address some of the user pain points. The complexities of certain topics do not always translate well into writing; therefore, there is a need for other aids such as information graphics to assist with visualization and to increase the efficacy of information communication [1]. The benefits of information graphics in documentation and learning modules are well documented by the works of Levin and Pane [2, 3]. The conclusion is simple according to Davison, Pane, and Bertrancourt: if graphics are crafted correctly with the intent to enhance understanding then the quality of the documentation will improve and ultimately enrich the user experience and comprehension [4, 5, 6].With this sage advice, one might expect implementation to be straightforward, perhaps even easy. This is unfortunately not the case. Careful consideration is necessary to construct an information graphic. Many questions may arise during the process, such as how many graphics, and which type, are needed, and where best to insert them in order to convey the concept clearly. Some information graphics, such as charts and graphs, require further thought since their visual representation is derived from data. In this case, the challenge lies in shaping the data into what is truly useful for users' comprehension, and in skillfully rendering the graphics with sound design principles. This paper presents the authors' recent experiences in collaborative design of charts and graphs, and demonstrates that the responsibility of communicating effectively should not lie on one person's shoulders alone, but rather on all development and documentation professionals who bring their collective expertise to fruition in a partnership.},

In particular, a number of contradictory views about the nature of digital documents raise questions about what factors shape the task of document encoding. To date there have been few studies that explore the relationship between human document encoders and the documents they produce, where the process of documentation embedded in encoding is the focus. In this paper we argue that to support and improve the processes of digital document development it is essential that we gain a clearer understanding of context and the situated, inter-subjective nature of human engagement in documentary practice. We present a methodology for understanding such documentary practices, which considers digital representation through the lens of practice theory and presents a conceptual framework for understanding the complex and changing dimensions of document encoding that are challenging both research and practice.},

abstract = {Annotating function of genes accurately is one of the most important tasks in molecular biology and medical sciences. The new sequencing technology, called the next generation sequencing technology, made sequencing the whole genomes possible with a fraction of cost of sequencing by using the traditional sequencing technology. As a result, the amount of sequence data has been growing very rapidly, but the computational method for gene function annotation is yet to be fully developed. Thus annotation of gene function is a serious bottleneck to achieving the high-throughput genome projects. The most commonly used gene annotation technique is to transfer annotation of genes based on the sequence similarity; annotation of top-ranked genes in terms of sequence similarity is simply transferred to the function of a target gene. However, this sequence-similarity based gene function annotation is often incorrect. As a result, genome projects still rely on expensive, error-prone, labor-intensive, manual process. Combining annotation and sequence similarity can improve the accuracy of gene function annotation significantly. We have been developing a computational method for comparing gene annotation in text. In this paper, we will discuss issues in comparing genome annotation in a text format. To compute textual similarity, we used cosine similarity. Since cosine similarity is effective only after preprocessing with textual variations, we used commonly used text preprocessing techniques such as removing stop words and stemming as well as gene annotation specific preprocessing such as handling synonyms and gene symbols using databases of biology terminologies such as BioThesaurus and MeSH. In experiments with annotations of a number of bacterial genomes, our method was able to handle many difficult cases (syntactically different but semantically equivalent gene function annotations) correctly.},

abstract = {E-commerce privacy policies tend to consist of many ambiguities in language that protects companies more than the customers. Types of ambiguities found are currently divided into four patterns: mitigation (downplaying frequency), enhancement (emphasizing nonessential qualities), obfuscation (hedging claims and obscuring causality), and omission (removing agents). A number of phrases have been identified as creating ambiguities within these four categories. When a customer accepts the terms and conditions of a privacy policy, words and phrases (from the category of mitigation) such as "occasionally" or "from time to time" actually give the e-commerce vendor permission to send as many spamming email offers as they deem necessary . Our study uses techniques based on Latent Semantic Analysis to discover the underlying semantic relations between words in privacy policies. Additional potential ambiguities and other word relations are found automatically. Words are clustered according to their topic in privacy policies using principal directions. This provides us with a ranking of the most significant words from each clustered topic as well as a ranking of the privacy policy topics. We also extract a signature that forms the basis of a typical privacy policy. These results lead to the design of a system used to analyze privacy policies called Hermes. Given an arbitrary privacy policy our system provides a list of the potential ambiguities along with a score that represents the similarity to a typical privacy policy.},

Using and categorizing definitions of interactivity from the fields of new media, computer science, communication, and advertising in order to begin to conceptualize interactivity, this paper will argue that rather than coming up with a single definition of interactivity that can be used in multiple disciplines, interactivity should be conceptualized along a continuum. By conceptualizing the term interactivity along a continuum, practitioners and instructors can be better able to use the term interactivity more productively, which can help practitioners and instructors who create or who teach others how to create interactive documents have a more generally agreed upon meaning that will further the ability to produce texts appropriate for an audience, purpose, and context.},

abstract = {Recent scholarship in games suggests that communications design can offer a more critical approach to understanding and developing meaningful player experiences. In this paper, I analyze such experiences by examining the usability of The Arcade Wire: Airport Security in relation to its rhetorical aims as a game. Synthesizing two models for games analysis, I can develop a new model to more fully account for affective responses in player experience. Furthermore, the model itself can be reconfigured to examine different gamespaces that configure different relationships among their structural and phenomenlogical elements.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 represents a major shift in how individuals communicate and collaborate with others. While many of these technologies have been used for public, social interactions (e.g., Wikipedia and YouTube), organizations are just beginning to explore their use in day-to-day operations. Due to relatively recent introduction and public popularity, Web 2.0 has led to a resurgent focus on how organizations can once again leverage technology within the organization for virtual and mass collaboration. In this paper, we explore some of the key questions facing organizations with regard to Web 2.0 implementation and adoption. We develop a model of "Web 2.0 Proclivity", defined as an individual's propensity to use Web 2.0 tools within the organization. Our model and set of associated hypotheses focuses on understanding an employee's internal Web 2.0 content behaviors based on non-work, personal use behaviors. To test our model and hypotheses, survey-based data was collected from a global engine design and manufacturing company. Our results show that Web 2.0 Proclivity is positively influenced by an employee's external behaviors and that differences exist across both functional departments and employee work roles. We discuss the research implications of our findings as well as how our findings and model of Web 2.0 Proclivity can be used to help guide organizational practice.},

In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer model for the exchange of context information and user annotations over video. The Context-Aware Peer-to-Peer Architecture (CAPPA) exploits the automatic capture of the user-interaction with personal devices, employs ontologies to store context information, and uses the context information to organize users in P2P groups for the collaborative exchange of information. We present our proposed model by discussing a prototype system, called CAPPA Service (CAPPAS), which allows users to create and to join peer-to-peer groups using Web-based social communities. Using CAPPAS, users are able to create multimodal annotations while watching videos. The service deploys a capture mode which can be adapted according to the context information collected from the P2P network. CAPPAS customization features include the adaptation of its graphical interfaces according to context information, and the automatic suggestion of text completion during annotation.},

abstract = {Interdisciplinary design is challenging, in large measure, because of the difficulty in communicating and coordinating across disciplines. Team members from different disciplines may view and solve the same problem from different perspectives, with their own unique method and language, which may create barriers to information sharing. Wikis, in particular, have gained popularity as a collaborative tool and have been claimed to support collaboration and information sharing. Despite the increasing use of wikis in design projects, there has been little research attention to how wikis are actually used by design teams. This paper describes a field study of two interdisciplinary design teams, seeking to discover how wikis support information sharing in software development projects. The study provides empirical evidence on the use of wikis in interdisciplinary design work, which will be used to develop guidelines on the effective use of wikis to support interdisciplinary design collaboration.},

Collective intelligence can take many forms - this paper examines one, the emergence of stable facts on Wikipedia. More specifically, this paper examines ways of participating that lead to the creation of facts. This research will show how we can be more effective consumers, producers, and managers of wiki information by understanding how collaboration shapes facts.},

abstract = {Digital backchannel communication has become an increasingly important area of study for researchers and practitioners in several fields. From the emergence of wifi-enabled Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to contemporary instances of microblogging and SMS messaging, the role of digital backchannels in enabling collaborative affordances has received much recent attention. As backchannel communication continues to become more prevalent at professional conferences, in educational curricula, and in organizational settings, robust frameworks for understanding the role of backchannel environments in collaborative meaning-making are needed. Drawing upon cultural-historical activity theory and actor network theory, this paper explores the development of backchannel persistence through microblogging platforms, and suggests an approach to studying the collaborative affordances of backchannel communication by focusing on the related concepts of mobilization and recursive writing collaboration.},

Unfortunately, there is currently little concrete guidance available on how to do so effectively. This workshop will explore the current state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in documenting SOA-based systems. The goal is to learn from past experience in documenting other software-intensive systems, including the use of graphical documentation techniques relying on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), but taking into account the unique features and challenges inherent in SOA-based systems (e.g., properly documenting issues related to governance). This workshop is the 7th in a series of events exploring graphical documentation in the context of aiding system understanding.},
