abstract = {Successful visual querying requires users to understand what data selection means and how it works in interactive and dynamically linked graphics. Visually selecting data differs from writing query or search statements, and users who are new to visualizations have to learn this new paradigm of querying. A usability study that I conducted provides findings about problems that users encounter in visual selection when analyzing data for a realistic, complex business problem. These problems reveal the program-based support that users need in order to make accurate, complete, and efficient selections. I identify combined improvements in user interfaces and Help that address these problems.},

abstract = {This paper supports critics of current approaches to the development of computer graphing and graph visualization programs which model the user as an individual problem solver reliant on perceptual skills. These critics argue that such a model of graphing is ill-suited to meet the complex needs of real users. This paper agrees with this criticism and provides conclusions from two bodies of literature on graphing practices which have not been traditionally cited in studies of computer development, graph production and human factors. These literature surveys are taken from the fields of the sociology of scientific and technical practices and of educational research in science and technology. Surveys of these literatures illustrate the importance of experience and culture in the successful practice of designing and interpreting graphs.},

Drawing on a historical study, it demonstrates that the varied forms given to documentation have a long history, extending back at least to the early days of commercial mainframe computing. The data suggests that (1) early forms of computer documentation were borrowed from existing genres, and (2) official and unofficial documentation existed concurrently, despite efforts to consolidate these divergent texts. The study thus provides a glimpse into the early experimental nature of documentation as writers struggled to find a meaningful way to communicate information about their organization's developing computer technology.},

How can you develop single-source documentation for output in multiple formats, without having to store your source in a specific format that will soon become obsolete? The answer is to use a combination of your own SGML or XML tags to mark up your documentation and a simple OmniMark® program to create each output format and presentation style. There's also a third ingredient: teamwork. As much as any technology, you need a team that can manage itself, in which everyone is willing to take tasks from someone who's overloaded. At OmniMark Technologies, we developed documentation for a new product, SureSpeed, using an SGML system we designed and short programs we wrote in OmniMark. The teamwork came from innovative and co-operative individuals who made up the OmniMark documentation team.},

abstract = {As online information becomes more comprehensive in its scope, the sheer wealth of information can be overwhelming. Information needs to be both browsable and searchable, and both needs are best met with a structured information approach (such as SGML or XML).Browsing assumes a primary sequence of all information, which is unlikely to be appropriate for all readers. Searching assumes no primary sequence: information is sorted by relevance for a particular query, creating any number of ad hoc sequences as a result. However, the criteria for relevance specified in the search is unlikely to be reflected within the returned topics: they are usually still structured in a way that reflects the primary browsing path. For example, a search of API information for a description of a specific method returns a description of the entire class where it is declared, because API documentation is organized around classes, even though this particular search has nothing to do with classes.One way to resolve this tension (between linear display and multidimensional search) is with multiple documents that capture various useful ways of looking at the same information. However, the number of possible views and the growing size of information bases can make static generation of such views prohibitively expensive.The ideal solution would be a dynamically assembled document, in which the information base is so comprehensively structured that it can be meaningfully reconstructed into any number of relevant documents, whose derived structures reflect the needs of a particular reader and environment.This is a speculative paper that looks at what the interface to a dynamically assembled document might look like.},

In this paper we present an approach for the integration of electronic documents, which is part of a system called PANDA. Our approach has benefits for editors, authors, and readers: it easily allows the editor to provide multiple user interfaces with minimal overhead, while the authors can present their submissions using any of the permitted different formats, and the readers can choose one of these formats or define their own. The customization of the layout as provided by PANDA goes beyond that provided by widely available tailorable interfaces, such as MyYahoo!. Currently our approach works on HTML files but is general enough to accommodate XML or other formats in the future.},

abstract = {As the focus of our work on electronic publishing, the department for Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Trier has developed methods and prototypical tools for use of the Internet in both kinds of publications since about mid-1994. While transfer of documents as-is can nowadays be considered everyday technology (which it wasn't, for several reasons, in 1994), and proper collection and processing of metadata is at least doable, the areas of mixed-platform document processing and support of the editorial process are still in the research phase. In this paper, we will focus on recent work in the latter area.In one of our projects — the Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC), operative sind the end of 1994 — the decision process for selection of contributions to include was radically simplified in comparison to traditional journals. As a result, ECCC has a guaranteed limit on the delay between submission and decision of two months; many electronic journals use the same decision mechanism as paper journals, and suffer the same delays of sometimes over a year because of the time spent for communication between reviewers and editors.This approach could not be used, however, in the tools we developed for electronic conference submission. Conferences have established modi operandi, usually involving distribution of the submissions for reviewing down several hierarchical levels and an actual meeting of the editors (program committee, PC) for the final decision. As a consequence, the first tools we presented did not address the decision process at all, which left a large procedural hole between the actual electronic submission and the later support of final version submission and conference attendance.In 1999, we performed electronic submissions to the Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS), and since the conference was hosted in Trier, we were able to “co-develop” certain changes in the decision process and a software implementing support for the entire process. The software performed well and demonstrated the anticipated advantages, the most memorable being publication of the list of accepted papers — formerly taking place up to a week after the PC meeting — while the assembled PC members watched.},

abstract = {This paper examines the case for componentization of HTML-based help webs. Instead of providing a single, monolithic help web for a complex software product, content providers can provide online help that is divided (or componentized) along the same functional lines as the software itself. Traditionally, online help has been chunked according to task orientation, and a component-centered approach appears to challenge task orientation. In the proposed approach, componentization is achieved without sacrificing a task-orientation; they complement one another. Componentization of online help makes the help system more usable for users, and makes the task of integrating help content more flexible for help content providers — all without sacrificing the user's task perspective.},

Training materials created for print are adapted, first for passive online presentation, then for interactive computer-based training. In each adaptation, the materials are modified to suit a different environment or application of the product being described. The subject matter and educational objectives are not modified.The presentation will discuss the rationale for the recommended strategy and outline the steps in the process by which it is executed, illustrating the process with examples.},

Aim of this paper is to describe a solution for both problems, which is based on department structure, subject areas, and roles in an enterprise. Our approach will be introduced by presenting the DAPHNE system. DAPHNE provides possibilities to support collaborative authoring on a document hierarchy that reflects the diverse branches of an enterprise's organization structure and allows diverse (documentation) information sources of an enterprise to be well structured. The role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism implemented within DAPHNE is supported by the document hierarchy as well.},

abstract = {How do we support successful, lifelong learners and performers and help them competently respond to rapidly changing opportunities in the 21st century. The answer to this challenging question lies in how well we consider diverse sources for successful learning and explain audiences differentiated by individual learning differences. After years of primarily cognitive traditions, lack of strong theoretical foundations, and imperfect one-size-fits-all designs, our cognitive-rich explanations are missing the significant, higher-order impact of affective, conative, and other factors on learning. In this study the investigator introduces learning orientation (learner-difference profiles) to examine the fundamental sources for individual learning differences from an entirely new perspective. This perspective highlights the importance of intentions and emotions and describes how these dominant factors guide, manage, and sometimes override cognitive (thinking) processes. Using multiple repeated measures univariate ANOVAs, this study exhibits how learning orientation, time, and environments account for significant variance, effects, and interactions. The results demonstrate useful ways to analyze and differentiate the audience before designing solutions and environments for more successful performance.},
