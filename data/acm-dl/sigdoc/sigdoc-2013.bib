abstract = {Understanding the terminology used by different user groups as they interact with a system's information is a primary focus of information analysis. User terminology directly reflects audience groups' mental models, how they perceive the overall situation, and how their needs differ from other groups. The web of mappings of terminology between user groups and system interaction goals provides a path to developing a 5E model that can be carried forward into the design process. During the early information analysis, the designers and user experience people have to analyze multiple audiences, create personas, create a 5E model for each persona, and then resolve and merge the differences so that the final design works for all audiences. Building 5E models for multiple audiences provides a method to optimize across those audiences.},

abstract = {Knee replacement surgery is dramatically increasing in the United States for people over the age of 45 and rehabilitation after surgery is a necessary step for the success of the replacement. Rehabilitation requires regular access to a wide variety of resources and personnel. Currently, there are no self-care tools to enable tracking a patient's rehabilitative progress at home. As such, there is an opportunity to design and develop sensing technology tools to help alleviate the healthcare system and empower people in the knee rehabilitation process. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design process for a wearable, home rehabilitation device for knee replacement: an eTextile Knee Sleeve. More specifically, it describes the design research methods undertaken to understand user needs, including expert interviews, rehabilitation observation, and a participatory design workshop, to leverage advancements in technology and the field of eTextiles.},

abstract = {Public administrations must communicate with a diverse citizenry concerning complex programs and initiatives. Because producing individual communications for a large citizenry is expensive, the communications are written generically, carefully discussing all possible contingencies and details. Because the programs are complex, these generic communications are difficult to understand. One way to communicate more effectively in this complex environment is to automatically tailor each communication based on the context of each individual citizen. This paper presents a prototype system that produces web presentations describing the programs offered by a public administration agency to the citizenry it serves. The work is presented as an example of work on the pragmatic web. Particular attention is focused on the system's authoring tool, which allows authors to produce and configure the resources required to drive the tailoring mechanism.},

abstract = {The Web is currently the main way of providing computing services, reaching a larger number of users with different characteristics. As the complexity and interactivity of systems is increased, users become more demanding towards all the requirements associated to their distinct needs. Implementing the interaction requirements in the Web has become the main focus of accessibility and usability studies, describing essential design features which provide users with quality, assured systems. The focus on the users reinforced that as the number of users grows and the system became available to a wide variety of users, accessibility and usability features become even more critical to a Web application's success. In this paper, we present ACCESSA, a practical approach to rapidly improve the accessibility of existing Web systems, acting mainly in the interface design with no changes to the functional requirements of systems. The ACCESSA is based on the WCAG 2.0 guidelines and other patterns, choosing the guidelines that present lower implementation costs and represent higher severity accessibility issues.},

We situate analytics as a heuristic process, the intentional creation of forms and events for aggregating and assessing data within and across systems. Using examples from healthcare and library science we highlight: (1) The opportunities and complications of working with comprehensive data sets (100% of population) rather than representative samples; (2) The importance of outliers, and (3) The social dynamics associated with inventing concepts. We suggest that analytics is equally a social, technical, and rhetorical activity. Meaningful queries will invent and aggregate concepts that enable description, assessment, and change throughout a social system. We stress the contextual and social dynamics of analytics noting that like any rhetorical activity, analytics simultaneously construct, reflect, and impose value and meaning on systems under scrutiny.},

To address the challenges posed by responsive design, aiming to simplify their development by factoring out the common parts from the specific ones, this paper presents Quill, a web-based development environment that enables various stakeholders of a web application to collaboratively adopt a model-based design of the user interface for cross-platform deployment. The paper establishes a series of requirements for collaborative model-based design of cross-platform web user interfaces motivated by the literature, observational and situational design. It then elaborates on potential solutions that satisfy these requirements and explains the solution selected for Quill. A user survey has been conducted to determine how stakeholders appreciate model-based design user interface and how they estimate the importance of the requirements that lead to Quill.},

abstract = {Large-scale information system evolution projects often place high demands on both business and technical stakeholders' cognitive and communication skills. Especially if the need for evolution is not confined to a particular feature, but affects the whole value chain, finding dependencies and interrelationships between processes and components is challenging as it requires cross-departmental understanding. These issues can be even more challenging for management stakeholders who need to make high-level and far-reaching decisions on implementation strategies despite not being deeply involved in the technical details. One of the main problems in such projects is that the stakeholders who have expert knowledge typically have only little methodical experience, while the method experts lack the business experience. In this paper, we report on experiences and lessons from a large systems evolution project in a German insurance company, where we applied a new approach -- the so-called "Interaction Room" -- to improve stakeholders' understanding of the project's risks and dependencies in a pragmatic way, without overwhelming them with a heavyweight analysis method.},

Complex and unclear UIs and instructions make compliance with self-management schedules often poor. The issue of compliance, with the need for effective communication between chronic disease patients and healthcare professionals emphasize the need for the appropriate UI and communication technology. Improvement is made from the perspective of the user experience (UX) / UI redesign. Usability studies were conducted, followed by the UI redesign and icons design with the aim to address the UX design. A mobile application concept for the RPM is developed, that could be used on existing tablets and smartphones, thus eliminating the need for the current costly hardware.},

Therefore there is a need to design and implement learning systems that are not complex, confusing or complicated. This paper discusses, based on a review of the literature, how we could simplify educational technology and learning systems by focusing on one of the most important user centered design principles, i.e. understanding learner's needs and establishing requirements. It is also important to consider the learning context before focusing on the characteristics and system requirements. In conclusion, nowadays, more than ever before, new and emerging technologies could make possible the design of powerful learning systems that could transform the quality of learning as long as they are easy to use, intuitive and provide an engaging user experience.},

These technologies are often disconnected and require separate maintenance and coordination. This system leads to more complex processing and communication that creates confusion in collaboration. It is also time consuming, have little or no flexibility and accumulates data overhead. To address these issues, we propose a new Integrated Internet and Intranet (I3) architecture, information flow models and optimization techniques to streamline the communication and enhance the collaboration. With an efficient Big Data processing design and optimization techniques, we reduce the complexity and enhance the computer-human interaction. Our implementation of this architecture in a non-profit international organization showed significant improvement in communication and collaboration by reducing the number of emails, duplicates of documents, man-hours, and number of steps for each task.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the rhetorical construction of two community sites and analyze how these sites support the information sharing practices of these communities. By examining activity on web-based discussion boards reddit and 4chan, we show how these spaces are developed and shaped over time by participants making rhetorical moves in order to share content within these ecologies. During the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, we show how these spaces can be altered, disregarding the more typical practices on these sites. When community members embrace or reject these uses, it is as much a reaction to the content as it is to the cultural misuse of the community. In the case of reddit and 4hcan, this acceptance and rejection is especially true when the makers and maintainers of the system are participants themselves. Through this examination, we conclude that it is important to understand the rhetorical construction of these systems as reflections of the cultures they support.},

This framework was developed as part of a research focus, entitled "sympathetic devices," which focuses on the design of communication technologies for older adults. The core elements of the framework are outlined providing examples of product concepts where the framework has been applied in order to demonstrate its capabilities. The significance of utilizing the framework is to better design technologies to help older adults age healthy and independently, specially focusing on the utilization of tangible interactions as an extension of the use of touch interfaces.},

abstract = {Mobile devices, together with touch-screen interfaces, have become part of the everyday usage items of many information consumers across the globe. However, it is clear that the learning curve for touch-screen interfaces is steeper than what was expected. This presents some problems especially along with the current trend towards designing more complex mobile applications. The objective of this research was to determine how users interact with applications on touch-screen mobile devices, and how they progress through the various learning phases. A literature study, two pilot studies and a full survey questionnaire were used to gather data and perceptions about the status quo of learning within mobile touch-screen interfaces. Results indicated the presence of recurring patterns in users' preferences. In particular, associations with personal characteristics, namely age, gender and the length of experience, were observed. These patterns might provide fundamental value as a theoretical ground for designing intuitive mobile applications.},

abstract = {Studies of what software developers need from API documentation have reported consistent findings over the years; however, these studies all used similar methods--usually a form of observation or survey. Our study looks at API documentation as artifacts of the open-source software communities who produce them to study how documentation produced by the communities who use the software compares to past studies of what software developers want and need from API documentation. We reviewed API documentation from 33 of the most popular open-source software projects, assessed their documentation elements, and evaluated the quality of their visual design and writing. We found that the documentation we studied included most or all the documentation elements reported as desirable in earlier studies and in the process, we found that the design and writing quality of many documentation sets received considerable attention. Our findings reinforce the API requirements identified in the literature and suggest that the design and writing quality of the documentation are also critical API documentation requirements that warrant further study.},

Accordingly, users are interested in knowing how counterparts apply the software, despite raising concerns about privacy. Based on these findings, the poster illustrates the advantages that software companies - especially those operating on a Waterfall development model - can gain by allowing users to participate in creating and refining documentation. In addition to reducing the learning curve for users, participatory documentation enables companies to gather feedback that is critical to making documentation and software more usable.},
