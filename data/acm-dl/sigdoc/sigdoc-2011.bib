From this analysis, we constructed a matrix with appropriateness/inappropriateness values for all combinations of communicative functions and animation types covered by our survey. To illustrate how the model could be applied to graphical user interfaces and to assess the model's plausibility, we used the model to develop two versions of a user interface for an MP3 player.},

Targeted to blind high-school children, our innovative design, AEDIN (Acoustic EDutainment INterface), uses non-speech sounds simultaneously as navigational prompts and content icons/signifiers for recorded text-to-speech educational essays, which are the main content of this application. A study of two versions of AEDIN was conducted with 20 participants from a K-12 school for the BVI to evaluate its usability and identify ways to improve it. Through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data, we discovered key design improvements that made AEDIN a highly usable and enjoyable interface for these users. The paper highlights good design practices for acoustic interfaces.},

abstract = {The role of human-computer interaction technologies has become a prominent factor that most can determine the successful introduction of new computer games. Players, in fact, wish to experience playful exchanges with the objects and characters that compose games. To reach this aim, new technologies have come into the play that comprise the use of video cameras and gesture recognition software. The great news is that such types of technologies could be exploited not only while playing at home on a console, but also in public spaces, thus broadening the use of games to new segments of customers. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, neither relevant exemplars of such specific type of games (that can be played in public spaces) have yet emerged, nor extensive measurement studies exist regarding how players enjoy games in public immersive environments (e.g., fairs, museums and exhibits), the motivation being that those technologies that support completely hands-free gaming have been commercialized only very recently. Hence, our contribution with this article is twofold: on one side we want to illustrate the main design principles we have devised to design a gestural game to be played in a public space, based on novel hand following and gesture recognition techniques. On the other side we wish to report on real measurements we took when over one hundred players enjoyed our gestural game at the Shanghai 2010 World Expo.},

abstract = {Gathering players is unavoidably costly when we run large-scale "Langrid Gaming", which is a Language Grid-linked multilingual and multinational gaming simulation. If people can be replaced in the gaming simulations, the cost decreases. Thus, a player agent has been introduced. First, game experiments were conducted in natural language, and parallel texts and player agents were developed by analyzing the experiments. Second, experiments were conducted in Japanese Experiment 1) and in Japanese and Chinese (Experiment 2). Negotiation protocols were analyzed, and new parallel texts were developed from Experiments 1 and 2. Third, experiments were conducted in Japanese (Experiment 3) once again, and Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were compared and analyzed. The following results were obtained. (1) Using parallel texts enables a player agent to be introduced. (2) Various negotiation protocols can be extracted by repeating an experiment with a greater variety of participants. (3) Valid parallel texts can be extracted by analyzing negotiation protocols and functions of utterances. (4) Adding new parallel texts reduces fruitless utterances and changes the negotiations protocol.},

However, the potential of those technologies could have been exploited further in order to transform students from passive data receivers, to active actors in the learning process. The scope of this paper is the presentation of a theoretical educational framework for the use of interactive three dimensional virtual environments with game characteristics that aims at the initiation of motivation and enhancement of learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework a prototype educational application called "VRLerna" has been implemented and evaluated with real users. VRLerna is an interactive reconstruction of the central building of a prehistoric population at Lerna of Argolis which is used to teach history at Key stage 5. The paper describes the methodology used to evaluate the prototype and via this the theoretical educational framework and presents the evaluation results that portray the success of the prototype to attract the students interest and keep them engaged and motivated.},

This tool has been enhanced on the basis of the experience and know-how obtained from the participants' comments and suggestions.However, the object and the model object of the gaming tool are usually defined as Java or PHP objects, which makes it difficult for non-programmers to develop a new game. In this study, we propose a framework to implement various types of Langrid Gaming easily. In particular, we designed a new domain specific language (DSL) called 'Karina' to describe targeted games, and implemented a translator to convert Karina script into CGI programs. This script development environment makes game building easy and simplifies the development procedures, regardless of whether the gaming developer is a programmer or not.},

Our Comic Computing method uses the classical features of comics to create a unique user interface that enhances communication. We first analyzed the comic medium from the viewpoint of a user interface by focusing on information visualization, and then we developed several systems on the basis of the analysis results. Our goal was twofold: comic creation and application, both of which can be used to foster creative and visual communication.

abstract = {Knowledge work at computer workplaces involves execution of multiple concurrent tasks with frequent task interruptions. The complexity of the resulting work processes makes task externalization a desired goal towards facilitating analysis and support of knowledge work, e.g. by extracting and disseminating best practices.In this paper, we present a task mining method that identifies tasks based on interaction histories. The method generates instances of a semantic hierarchical task model which captures an abstraction of the work processes. A specific characteristic of the method is that it mines tasks based on a combination of semantic and temporal features, extracted from enriched interaction histories. The use of semantic similarity results in a high robustness of the system with respect to task interruption and concurrent task execution. An evaluation of our task mining method based on a study with users executing frequently interrupted tasks is presented. One element of the evaluation is the assessment of different algorithms for semantic similarity computing, namely Term Matching (TM), Vector Space Model (VSM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For an approach using VSM a precision of 0.83, a recall of 0.76 and a F1-measure of 0.79 is reached.},

Following a first generation of human-centered social networks, the notion of object-centered sociality has been introduced to describe the fact that strong social relationships are built mainly when individuals are grouped together around a shared object. In this paper we attempt to further enhance the notion of the social object and present the concept of heterogeneous social network, where humans and social objects are uniformly treated as equal actors. The paper discusses how this notion can be exploited in different application domains and presents in more detail a particular example from the field of medical education.},

abstract = {There has been extensive discussion and research surrounding fidelity or refinement of prototypes in paper and software form, especially focusing on how the nature of prototypes influences the feedback that this prototype can help elicit during user testing. We extend this debate to the domain of video prototypes, where use scenarios are acted out on video. This study examines how the visual refinement (a.k.a. visual fidelity) of design representations presented in such videos impacts user feedback. An experiment was performed where two video prototypes were compared, one where the product is portrayed with high visual refinement and the other looking rough and sketchy. Our results could not identify any significant effects upon the number or type of comments returned by users. This finding contrasts widely held contentions relating to fidelity of software and paper prototypes, though it agrees with similar experiments done with non video prototypes. In practice our results support the validity of testing with low fidelity videos and suggest that the choice of visual fidelity in video prototypes should be based on pragmatic project concerns, e.g., whether the video should be used also for communication and the resources that are available for prototyping.},

abstract = {Ambient Intelligence (AmI) constitutes an evolution of Information and Communication Technologies which responds to the current increasing demand for anytime anywhere availability of information and electronic services. AmI technologies integrate sensing capabilities, processing power, reasoning mechanisms, networking facilities, applications and services, digital content, and actuating capabilities distributed in the environment. While a wide variety of different technologies is involved, the goal of AmI is to either entirely hide their presence from users or to smoothly integrate them within the surrounding context as enhanced environment artifacts, rather than as technological gadgets. The pervasiveness of interaction in AmI environments requires the elaboration of new interaction concepts that extend beyond the current user interface concepts like the desktop metaphor and menu driven interfaces. AmI will therefore bring about new interaction techniques, as well as novel uses and multimodal combinations of existing advanced techniques, such as, for example, gestures and localisation. Additionally, interaction is embedded in everyday objects and smart artifacts. This concept refers to interfaces that use physical artifacts as objects for representation and interaction, seamlessly integrating the physical and digital worlds. Interaction in AmI environments inherently relies on multimodal input, implying that it combines various user input modes, such as speech, pen, touch, manual gestures, gaze and head and body movements, as well as more than one output modes, primarily in the form of visual and auditory feedback. In this context, adaptive multimodality is prominent to support natural input in a dynamically changing context-of-use, adaptively offering to users the most appropriate and effective input forms at the current interaction context.The ICS-FORTH Ambient Intelligence Programme is an on-going horizontal interdisciplinary RTD Programme aiming to develop and apply pioneering human-centric AmI technologies and Smart Environments, capable of "understanding" and fulfilling individual human needs. This Programme constitutes a systematic effort towards addressing the challenges which arise in the context of AmI, by providing natural forms of interaction and access to information and communication. In this context, a wide variety of AmI applications and services have been developed for various environments and domains, including home and everyday living, office work, culture and museums, exhibitions and public spaces, education, and health. These developments constitute showcases for demonstrating in practice AmI technologies and their potential and benefits in different aspects of everyday life and activities. Some of them have been deployed "in vivo" and are available and used in real environments, such as, for example, the exhibition of AmI artifacts "Macedonia from fragments to pixels" deployed at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. The new ICSFORTH AmI Research Facility, due to be completed by the end of 2011, will comprise simulated AmI-augmented environments and their support spaces, laboratory spaces for developing and testing related technologies, and will provide an appropriate environment for the pilot deployment and user-based evaluation of the developed AmI technologies under conditions very similar to real life.},

We obtained responses from 79 agile software development professionals and 8 teams in 13 different countries. Our findings include that over half of developers in our data set find documentation important or even very important but that too little documentation is available in their projects. Agile practitioners do not seem to agree with the agile principle that "The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."

abstract = {One of the core tasks of technical communication and knowledge management is maintaining the internal and external consistency of document collections. The design of (technical) communication infrastructures has to take this into account from the start. Consistency of static collections is enforced by format constraints (e.g. specified in a schema and validated grammatically). Recently, consistency in mutable knowledge collections can be supported by change management systems, that draw on specified semantics for knowledge objects and their relations. But even with machine support a seemingly minor change can easily cascade into a major adaptation task. In this paper we argue that the practice of maintaining "islands of consistency" in mutable knowledge collections can be supported by versioned links: Links as first-class elements defined by a triple of versioned elements (subject/predicate/object). The main idea explored here is that changes need not be propagated to linked elements, if those still reference the originally linked object. With this concept a major adaptation task can be put under user-friendly impact management. We give a model for versioned links that is easy to embed in existing systems and show how this concept supports impact management workflows.},

However, now that more and more 'serious' applications and services, such as online banking or multichannel shopping, are becoming distributed through multiple platforms as well as used at various times and locations, its specific characteristics are becoming increasingly relevant for other design domains as well. This paper will reflect on the process of designing crossmedia applications and services by describing experiences from teaching a course in crossmedia interaction design to industrial design students. It is argued that, in order to create seamless, interactive experiences, real crossmedia design should go beyond a pragmatic mix of the principles and characteristics of the design disciplines that constitute the individual platforms.},

Due to their static presentation of the complex issues involved, they remain inaccessible to most readers and pose formidable barriers even for experts. To enable advanced interactions which would support understanding, software systems will have to incorporate machine-understandable (formal) information, while retaining the informal nature of the documents, which allows efficient communication of ideas and methods between humans. The simplistic dichotomy between "formal" (as expressed in a logic) and "informal" (everything else) is not helpful as a guide for designing representation formats for context. As a step towards a remedy we propose the notion of flexibly formal representations (flexiforms) based on the analysis of document content and its context in the Software Engineering project SAMSDocs where we elicited a formal context for an informal document collection.},

Regarding this task, C2C has two resources that we named Cultural Translator and Machine Translator. The Cultural Translator uses a Brazilian Portuguese cultural knowledge base (from the Open Mind Common Sense - Br Project in collaboration to Media Lab - MIT) that works with the sender's vocabulary expression in order to provide alternative suggestions that can have the same colloquial meaning. The Machine Translation converts texts from a source language to a target language. The process that we used to combine these features and develop the application was based on an user-centered design approach with a focus on prototyping. We used different types of fidelity-levels (low, mid, high) before developing the functional web prototype version of C2C. User tests were then applied to evaluate usability issues. After collecting data from questionnaires and observation, problems were corrected and now we are heading to a larger user study regarding the C2C functionality. We have been performing a study case involving Brazilian and Canadian users. There are some initial results available from this study that will be discussed further. These data show that users appreciate the resources that help them design messages for cross-cultural communication.},

abstract = {Web forms are massively used as a very effective way for user interaction with information systems. Notwithstanding, filling in forms with personal data can be tedious and repetitive. Due to legal and technical constraints, full interoperability of information systems is not a straightforward solution. So that several client-side techniques have been developed in the last years to automate the task of filling in forms; for example, auto-filling and auto-complete are very well-known techniques that employ contextual information to fill in automatically Web forms. However, the accuracy of these techniques is limited by the contextual information available on the Web browser. Some information systems can record users' personal information on the server side and use them to provide pre-filled forms to returning users. The problem with such as an approach is that users must keep updated records of personal information in remote servers; legal and technical issues prevent from sharing personal data among different applications, thus users must maintain multiple accounts. Interestingly enough, the analysis of data requested in forms reveal a pattern in the set of pieces of personal information that are often required (e.g. names, affiliations, billing address, home address, bank account, etc). In this paper we propose a new approach for automating filling in form that relies on these patterns of personal information. Our ultimate goal is to provide means for supporting the exchange of data between user's Personal Information Management Systems (PIMS) and Web forms. The approach is supported by a tool called PIAFF (which stands for Personal Information Assistant for Filling Forms) and illustrated by a case study concerning forms used for student applications.},

The use of search engines to get help with software by both computer scientists and students in other disciplines is investigated. Students from all disciplines tested were found to use and be more satisfied by search engines than Help. Further investigation showed that, generally, students went to other people more than Help or search engines but found search engines and people to be the most satisfactory sources of help. Recommendations are made to improve Help systems by incorporating aspects of search engines.},

abstract = {Software design documentation is an important aid for communication during software development and maintenance. Nevertheless, little empirical evidence exists regarding the use of software documentation, and effective software design representation in particular. In an experimental setting, we used documentation from industry in which aspects of a software design were modeled in both a (UML) diagram and text. We recorded and analysed how participants used these media to answer various design-related questions and collected additional information in various questionnaires. By having participants think aloud, we set out to understand the underlying cognitive processes of developer design comprehension by applying the grounded theory method. We validated the results with concepts from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Results show a positive correlation between developer certainty and correctness of answers, whereas the opposite was not found. Also, self-rated experience and self-rated skill coincide with higher levels of certainty. We found that participants rated information based on perceived importance and that their "common sense" plays a significant role. Surprisingly, more than 60 percent of the answers were based on the consultation of a single medium. These results clearly ask for further investigation. We propose corresponding future work.},

The ACM SIGDOC has a relatively short history as special interest groups go (1975 to the present), but not in terms of the brief history and explosive growth of computer science, interface design, and the design of systems that support computer users. Indeed, interest in forming a special group focusing on systems documentation began to develop in the early 1970s. At the time, few technical writers (or few computer professionals who recognized themselves as technical writers) existed. Most systems documentation was being developed for military applications and large mainframe computer systems (such as those developed by IBM Corporation). Similar to the history of ACM SIGDOC, the field of communication design has burgeoned while simultaneously allowing increased fragmentation and distributed research initiatives across other developing fields.},

We explore theoretical issues for studying social media with respect to one popular research methodology: case study research (CSR). Here we examine the challenges that social media pose to CSR in the humanities and then advance an approach using social network analysis (SNA) to assist in selecting case studies. This approach, we argue, improves selection of case studies by considering the network structures of social media.},

However, to move beyond simple advertising kiosks and use public displays as a community tool typically requires a lengthy ethnographic approach. In this paper we describe CATS, a rapid UI design methodology that we developed and used to create a public display system for stimulating community interaction during a large university alumni event. The CATS methodology relies on the co-evolutionary process between (C)oncept design, (A)ctivity design, and (T)echnology design through (S)cenario dramatization. Each of the three design strands occurs simultaneously and is connected through a central scenario dramatization process, in which study participants selectively enact various aspects of the interaction in order to verify and explore different design issues. In this article, we briefly describe the CATS methodology and report on our use experiences.},

Homophily is the degree to which a pair of individuals who communicate are similar; so, it tends to promote more effective communication. The computational environment is the result of: a) a cultural knowledge-based method to identify people who "talks" about the same topic in social media; b) a method to generate culturally contextualized hyperdocuments, adapted and made available according to the level of literacy of a community. Thus, while the goal of method (a) is to improve the chances of "homophilous people" to come together and join the same community, the goal of method (b) is to make "innovative ideas" accessible to them, so that innovation can be seeded and spread among the online community's members.

The RP is activated when the information parsed through the visual channel consists of animation and on-screen text. This paper presents an experiment that explores the way the RP is related to learning videos and how the type of on-screen visual aid (text, call-outs) affects learners' comprehension. It also discusses preliminary results that derived from a pilot study. The presented work is part of a bigger project that explores several aspects of CTML in relation to learning videos design.},

DLEs make uniform learning possible, while allowing interaction (as opposed to a text book). However, it is unclear how interaction should be designed to be beneficial in a uniform learning situation. Feedback is needed in DLE, both for the learning itself, and for the functionality of the system. Through an evaluation framework the uniform learning situation is evaluated and feedback is mapped onto interaction lanes. Balanced feedback has the potential to offer a beneficial DLE for uniform learning. Although the importance of feedback is known in theory, our study shows that practical implementations lack complete feedback. Hence, we propose a design guideline to implement balanced (relative to the framework) feedback in general, and to pay specific attention to Feed-Forward when designing DLEs.},

abstract = {This poster reports data from a case study of the information management practices technical communicators at a software company in the U.S. Midwest. The study found that the technical communicators preferred location-based file folder browsing for their information finding and retrieval activities. Building on situated cognition theories of learning, the researcher speculates that file folder browsing may serve a learning purpose for the technical communicators by helping them internalize technical information about their products and social information about their work teams and processes.},
