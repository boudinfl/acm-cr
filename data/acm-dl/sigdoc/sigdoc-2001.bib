abstract = {Design of information used for technical communication of complex products should consider how learnable that information is, and strive to deliver materials that are inherently learnable.The speed of information interchange and the demands of the workplace and school curricula require increasingly minimalist approaches to the material that is made available. People are frustrated by long learning times, and new users of software tools demand rapid absorption of tool capabilities. In addition, many readers of technical information are people for whom English is not their native language.Methods and practices that worked in the period when people were willing to commit to hours of study to understand a topic, or days of practice to master a tool, no longer work in a world based on ?internet time.? To assist our understanding of these trends in learning, this paper addresses three key areas related to learnability: proposing a definition of learnability, showing where learnability and usability intersect, and providing a basis for learnability based on some attributes of human beings.},

abstract = {Maps are cognitive artifacts that represent not only the characteristics of the information space but also the use people make of the space. There are three privileged modalities by which humans learn the relationships in existing spaces: path-based learning, landmark-based learning and survey learning. These three modalities are differently sustained by maps and by the real environments. Maps afford Simultaneous experience of the space, Single point of view, Survey knowledge, Secondary spatial activity; while real environments afford Progressive Experience of the space, Multiple point of view, Procedural knowledge, Primary Spatial activity. The most important attempts to modify these differences between maps and real environments, and to merge their properties, have been: a) the creation of visual structures that enable focus + context views; b) the design of information landscapes that enable free flight in 3D space. The principles used to obtain such a view are the combination of Simultaneous and Progressive Experience of the space as a Primary spatial activity.We are designing new views for a graphic information system by merging the affordances of traditional maps and real environments for learning spatial relations. The emerging views will be presented and discussed from a theoretical point of view and exemplified in their application to the design of an information system for a National Park in Italy. The prototype of the information system was tested by human factors specialists and by end-users; the results of the test show both strength, and weakness, in the implementation of the proposed design concepts.},

abstract = {Our goal is to improve the content of help systems and provide better access to it, by giving users opportunities to signal breakdowns during interaction. To this end, we use a semiotic engineering model that explores both direct and indirect messages sent from designers to users via systems' interfaces. These messages represent how the designers conceived of the application, how they built it, and why. The online help system is an important component, because this is where designers have the best chances to explicitly express their vision. In this paper we review some of the classifications used to characterize help systems, and suggest that user-intent sensitivity should be explored as a new classification if we are targeting at efficient designer/user communication. We allow users to signal their intents by choosing among a limited set of predefined utterances, which provide an entry point to a cohesive discourse structure. The discourse is about the application's design rationale, and the operational and tactical instructions about how to use the application. Coupled with the application's conceptual model, and also the task and interaction models, these utterances allow help systems to provide information with increased probability of addressing the user's intentions.},

abstract = {Over the last decade an unfolding cognitive-psychology research program on how learners use examples to develop effective problem-solving expertise has yielded well-established empirical findings. Chi et al., Renkl, Reimann, and Neubert (in various papers) have confirmed statistically significant differences in how good and poor learners inferentially elaborate ("self-explain") example steps as they study. Such example elaboration is highly relevant to software documentation and training, yet largely neglected in the current literature.This paper summarizes the neglected research on example use and puts its neglect in a disciplinary perspective. I then show that differences in support for example elaboration in commercial software documentation reveal previously overlooked usability issues. These issues involve example summaries, using goals and goal structures to reinforce example elaborations, and prompting readers to recognize the role of example parts.Secondly, I show how these same example elaboration techniques can build cognitive maturity among underperforming high-school students who study technical writing. Principle-based elaborations, condition elaborations, and role recognition of example steps all have their place in innovative, high-school-level, technical-writing exercises, and all promote far-transfer problem solving.Finally, I use these studies to clarify the constructivist debate over what writers and readers contribute to text meaning. I argue that writers can influence how readers elaborate on examples, and that because of the great empirical differences in example-study effectiveness (and reader choices) writers should do what they can (through within-text design features) to encourage readers to elaborate examples in the most successful ways.},

The more casual approach to work made it possible for me to join the Product Design team during the spec and design phase of the project - the technical writer's nirvana. However, as the financial squeeze was felt our company underwent several restructurings. This meant fewer people to complete the required work. As someone who was involved in the product spec sessions I now found myself doing more and more Business Analyst work, with technical writing and training work falling by the wayside.This paper examines my experiences in the design, development and implementation phases of a product, as a technical writer and as a general addition to the team. This paper also reviews the positive and negative effects my work in other areas had on my ability to perform as a technical writer.},

abstract = {Field research in software documentation has a tradition of investigating how artifacts (from documentation to online help to interfaces to mundane equipment such as Post-It? notes) mediate or enable workers to perform complex tasks (see for instance [29]). Understanding artifacts and mediation can be key to understanding how well documentation supports work, and consequently, how we might design information to fit work patterns. Yet the field of technical communication has developed or adapted relatively few analytical frameworks for examining compound mediation, the ways that sets of artifacts work together to help workers get their jobs done. Such frameworks are important to understand because they provide us with guidance for investigating the mediatory relationships among artifacts - guidance which has important ramifications for intelligently designing information systems and inserting designed artifacts (such as documentation) into existing systems.In this paper, I use three analytical frameworks - contextual design's work models [4, 5, 23], distributed cognition's functional systems [1, 2, 13, 24], and genre ecologies [25, 26, 27, 28, 30] - to examine observational and interview data from a 1997 study of software developers. The observational study is a 10-week investigation of 22 software developers at work, focusing on how artifacts (such as manuals, code comments, and the code itself) collectively mediated the developers? production and comprehension of code at three units of the same global corporation. The study provides a good case for basing a comparison of the three frameworks because it (a) involves comparing multiple artifacts and complex use of artifacts across the different sites, and (b) uses ethnographic methods similar to those often used by proponents of the three frameworks.By applying the three frameworks to the same study, I illustrate which aspects of compound mediation are illuminated and unexplored by each analytical framework. Based on the comparison, I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each framework for exploring compound mediation, and I suggest ways in which the frameworks might be coordinated to produce different pictures of work.},

The differences as well as similarities among the original websites in English and the translated websites in Simplified and Traditional Chinese are analyzed for the addition, omission and retention of linguistic and cultural elements. The results suggest that the adaptation to native language and local culture of the target audience and market is one of the important quality indicators for multilingual websites. The results also show that language and culture are inseparable for developing quality multilingual websites in global e-commerce.},

abstract = {OCLC Online Computer Library Center has reduced costs and improved quality by using single sourcing in the localization of its services. For its FirstSearch reference service (which provides access to 80 databases for 18,000 libraries in 64 countries), OCLC has been through three phases of localization. Each phase has increased consistency and efficiency and lowered our translation costs. In the first phase of localizing FirstSearch in 1999, we introduced French and Spanish versions. The translation included the user interface screens and the help system. During this phase, we had minimal reuse of text in the interface and help files. The next year, OCLC released a major redesign of that service-with three levels of searching and greatly expanded database help. A separate administrative service and help system were also included. The translation task became much larger, and we needed to optimize the opportunities for text reuse in the system interfaces, help systems, and documentation. In the interfaces, all text strings were categorized and defined as entity strings-reused as needed among functions, databases, and user levels. For help and documentation, the needed content was analyzed and defined in an SGML DTD. Scripts were used to generate 240 help topics from a few SGML files. This approach reduced translation costs and facilitated consistency. Now in the third phase of localization, we are integrating our tool set, implementing a content management system, and adding support for Asian languages. Through this phase, we expect to reduce translation costs and improve quality.},

abstract = {The challenges that face content management writers are not just tools, but the design principles and concepts underlying content management. This paper is a case study that explores the challenges of teaching writers both to create encapsulated content and to design that content within a user-centric approach to information design. The approach used in the class provided a fine-grained definition of information types to move the writers as far as possible from the traditional documentation approach. The insights presented in this case study are drawn from instructors' experiences in presenting a course in content encapsulation to technical writers, employed by a traditionally mainframe-based software company. Writer reactions suggested that the approach taught in the class assisted them in overcoming existing preconceptions of document design, user profiling, and content creation.},

abstract = {Iterative development models allow developers to respond quickly to changing user requirements, but place increasing demands on writers who must handle increasing amounts of change with ever-decreasing resources. In the software development world, one solution to this problem is open-source development: allowing the users to set requirements and priorities by actually contributing to the development of the software. This results in just-in-time software improvements that are explicitly user-driven, since they are actually developed by users.In this article we will discuss how the open source model can be extended to the development of documentation. In many open-source projects, the role of writer has remained unchanged: documentation development remains a specialized activity, owned by a single writer or group of writers, who work as best they can with key developers and frequently out-of-date specification documents. However, a potentially more rewarding approach is to open the development of the documentation to the same sort of community involvement that gives rise to the software: using forums and mailing lists as the tools for developing documentation, driven by debate and dialogue among the actual users and developers.Just as open-source development blurs the line between user and developer, open-source documentation will blur the line between reader and writer. Someone who is a novice reader in one area may be an expert author in another. Two key activities emerge for the technical writer in such a model: as gatekeeper and moderator for FAQs and formal documentation, and as literate expert user of the system they are documenting.},

The scenario is a meta-model of the help document and contains information about the structure and behavior of the document. Therefore, the scenario-based design of help documents can achieve context-sensitive interaction between the system and a user depending on his/her knowledge level.This paper also demonstrates that SOF can be used to meet these demands placed upon online help systems, and includes a prototype system named Fit (Flexible Information Tailor).

The names of these scientists are obtained from the DBLP server [9]. The HomePageSearch system finds the Home Pages according to the names, and Mops finds research papers close to the Home Pages. It creates an index of these papers and makes it accessible on the web. We conclude that such a focused crawling is very effective for building high-quality collections and indices of scientific papers, using ordinary desktop hardware.},

Indexes can be considered as residing within interfaces, rather than just more pages accompanying a printed piece, or a tab stuck in a online help file. Designing indexes that work equally well in any of the various interfaces a document may be displayed in, whether print, help, PDF, or on the Web, presents a real challenge.Understanding the structure and relationships available in each destination format allows the indexer to design the index to work well in each instance. Ignoring an output format or assuming that the index is a simple construction leads to poorly designed online indexes, in which one format's requirements have been sacrificed for the output needs of another. In addition, print indexes do not translate well to online without consideration of screen design and user behavior.In this paper we discuss the interface indexing design issues for print, online HTML Help, PDF, XML, and plain HTML.},

This tutorial gives participants an understanding of how "experience design" is impacting documentation and online interactions. Participants learn why it is important to create positive user experiences -documentation that is both enjoyable and memorable - and how to transform user interactions into memorable experiences.The tutorial introduces a variety of field research and observation methods (including contextual inquiry, in-depth experience sessions, and user testing). Participants will learn a user-centered design process that shows them how to transform user data into actual design ideas; how to align the ideas with their organization's corporate voice, brand, and personality; and how to prototype, test, and implement these ideas - all with the intent of better meeting the information needs of users and creating positive user experiences. Guided group work allows participants to apply the concepts learned at each step of the process and provides valuable tools that can be used with any documentation processes. This tutorial will help participants expand their view of what documentation is and how it can be used as a strategic tool within their respective organizations.},

abstract = {As the Web drives technical communicators to move from creating documents to managing the flow of content in the form of thousands of interactive objects, the Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a standard way to describe that content, grab information from databases, enable business-to-business commerce, and personalize the information provided customers at online stores. This workshop gives non-programmers an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of XML, then shows you how to create a well-formed XML document with standard mark up tags. After this workshop, you will be able toIdentify reasons your organization may need to switch to XMLMark up documents with XML tagsIdentify current tools for creating and publishing in XMLIn-class exercises help you try out what you are learning. An extensive handout provides full details of the material we are studying, providing a useful reference when you return to work. You do not need to know HTML, but some familiarity with Web publishing will help you understand the context in which XML becomes important. This course does not give nuts-and-bolts instruction on any particular tool, and we do not go into the creation of Document Type Definitions (DTDs) or extensible stylesheets (XSLT).},

abstract = {International corporations and small organizations recognize that although you can buy in any language, you must use the customer's language to sell. Because of this, the dominance of English in the Internet is lessening. To effectively author for the Internet, the practice of sequential design in one language followed by subsequent adaptation to accommodate another language must change to that of creating an initial design accommodating multiple languages at once. But anytime more than one language is involved in anything many challenges arise. These must be addressed and overcome to achieve accuracy in message delivery. The challenges to doing this in the instant, dynamic, location-independent media that are available on the Internet are as unique as the demand for the capability is great. That's what makes it fun!This workshop addresses key issues in Designing and Authoring Multilingual Websites. Writing considerations, dealing with information, the way it is presented, and the content structure are addressed as are the technical issues of file structure, data definition and implementation. Through questions and answers, participants will help "design and build" a multilingual web site. As each of the key definitions is created, the participants will be presented with issues related to those definitions. In this way, we will work through the entire process, giving the participants a chance to learn more about the questions they may need to ask in order to create their own effective, maintainable, sustainable multilingual web sites.},

abstract = {We've entered the age of information recycling, but many of us have inherited whole libraries of legacy documents that are so poorly chunked and so incoherently written that we cannot easily move them into a Web site.In this intensive one-day workshop, you will learn how to adopt an object-oriented approach to editing current documentation to make it more effective on the Web. You will see how to rethink the purpose of each sentence, paragraph, and section, in reference material, process descriptions, and procedures, to prepare for extensive re-use in a variety of contexts, formats, and media. Done badly, the transformation of legacy materials ends in customer rebellion. Done well, it improves the quality, efficiency, and impact of your documentation.Working with hands-on exercises, discussion, and extensive readings, you will learn to reorganize, revise, and, if necessary, completely rewrite legacy materials, revising them for object-oriented disassembly and multiple re-use, modularizing them for random access, and developing guidelines for consistency across the site.The guidelines in this workshop come from usability research and practitioner lore, as well as my own experience consulting on large conversion projects. An extensive bibliography helps you look up relevant articles and books. This workshop does not promote or teach any particular software; the focus is on writing and editing skills you can apply in any situation. With this consistent, object-oriented approach to structure, you can convert the resulting documents into XML or SGML more easily than you could have transformed the tangled originals.Participants get a high-level overview of XML, because it is a formal way of describing rhetorical objects. Every structural analysis includes sample Document Type Descriptions (DTDs). But this workshop is not a hands-on course in XML. We look at XML because it provides a context in which we may soon be working, and its tags offer us a way of describing rhetorical objects in terms that external software and other organizations can recognize, allowing for additional re-use and manipulation of the material.},

abstract = {Software engineers rely on program documentation as an aid in understanding the functional nature, high-level design, and implementation details of complex applications. Without such documentation, engineers are forced to rely solely on source code. This is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially when one considers the amount of information assimilation and domain mapping that is required to understand the architecture of a large-scale software system. This paper describes an integrated approach to documenting software systems based on XML. In particular, the paper focuses on the creation and use of specific Document Type Definitions (DTD) that are defined by MSR as a standard for software documentation. MSR is a consortium of several German automotive companies whose goal is to support cooperative development between car manufacturers and their electronic system suppliers. To illustrate the approach, selected aspects of the document creation process for an engine control system are presented.},
