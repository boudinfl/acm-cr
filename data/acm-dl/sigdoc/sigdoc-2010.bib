If they are able to share their understanding within a "common ground" like a communicative or behavioral protocol, they can overcome their difficulties in communication, and we can improve information systems to help them improve mutual understanding. We designed a multilingual participatory gaming simulation, and conducted multilingual gaming experiments with Japanese and Korean participants. We extracted the protocol for conversation with mistranslations from the game logs and designed an agent to support conversation. Then, Japanese and Chinese played it and we observed and analyzed the behaviors of agents and the interaction between players and agents. Consequently, we obtained two main sets of results: (1) an agent function that notified players of the time that had elapsed since the conversation had broken down effectively speeded up their negotiations and achieved more active communications. (2) Tagging by participants was difficult and ineffective in leading to specific protocols and conversations when mistranslations occurred.},

In addition, this approach also aims to include accessibility features on models from official W3C guidelines such as WCAG and ATAG, allowing access by a wider range of users.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering for interactive systems remains a cumbersome task still under-supported by notations, development processes and tools. Indeed, in the field of HCI, the most common practice is to perform user testing to assess the compatibility between the designed system and its intended user. Other approaches such as scenario-based design promote a design process based on the analysis of the actual use of a technology in order to design new technologies better supporting users' tasks and activities. Some of them also support a critical element in the development of interactive systems: creativity. However, these approaches do not provide any support for a) the definition of a set of requirements that have to be fulfilled by the system under design and b) as a consequence for assessing which of these requirements are actually embedded in the system and which ones have been discarded (traceability and coverage aspects). This paper proposes a tool-supported notation for addressing these problems of traceability and coverage of both requirements and design options during the development process of interactive systems. These elements are additionally integrated within a more global approach aiming at providing notations and tools for supporting a rationalized design of interactive systems following a model-based approach. Our approach combines and extends previous work on rational design and requirements engineering. The current contribution, DREAMER, makes possible to relate design options with both functional and non functional requirements. The approach is illustrated by real size case study from large civil aircraft cockpit applications.},

abstract = {The concept of social networks in conjunction with concepts from economics has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper we propose the Stochastic Diffusion Market Search (SDMS), a novel contextual advertising method for mutual advertisement hosting among participating entities, where each owns a web site. In the scenario considered each participating agent/web-site buys or sells advertising links. In the proposed method the advertising market and network that formed into the system emerge from agents preferences and their social behavior into the network. SDMS consists of a variation of Stochastic Diffusion Search, a swarm intelligence metaheuristic, and an algorithm for market equilibria. We present an evaluation of the model and the experimental results show that the network potentially converges to a stable stage and the distribution of market prices adheres to power law properties.},

Providing a well structured information allows users to browse through different pieces of documentation without depending exclusively on the keyword search. Based on these observations, this research prototyped Kolline, a system that aims to facilitate information seeking for unexperienced users by allowing more experienced users to collaborate together. Users in Kolline create a task-oriented navigation structure based on web annotations. In this paper we discuss the potential benefits of this technique on helping unexperienced users to solve complex search tasks and present improvements for future work.},

abstract = {This experience report examines the user interface designs of Twitter and selected third party Twitter applications: Tweetdeck and Brizzly. Since participants are using different tools to communicate across the same system, Twitter users have different communication expectations. Evaluating Twitter and these tools based on usability heuristics found in activity theory and Morville's notion of findability, we argue for the normalization of these tools based on a set of mental models and affordances for Twitter. From this basis, we will report on how third-party clients more effectively exploit Twitter's affordances by making the streams, and thus the user's experiences, modular, emergent, and contextual. By comparing the UIs of Tweetdeck and Brizzly, along with that of Twitter's own web-based UI, we will assess how these clients allow participants to adapt Twitter streams to their own communication needs. The flexibility given to users via such clients serves as a tremendous signpost to the nature of and need for modular, context-aware experiences in communication channels as information content evolves. Not only do the social networks themselves need to be articulated and modular, but so do the UIs through which users engage with these networks. We argue that these features are critical for social media participants. Based on our analysis of Tweetdeck and Brizzly, we develop a set of best practices that should guide the research and design of participant experiences in social media and the third-party applications that many of them often use.},

Analyzing these two broad categories of stabilizing moves yields insights into how online writing practices may help foster effective and sustainable information ecologies.},

The Android architecture was used to integrate the cell phone camera, image capturing and analysis routines, on-device implementation of robust and efficient optical character recognition (OCR) engine and text to speech (TTS) engine to develop the proposed application in real-time. Empirical analysis under various environments (such as indoor, outdoor, complex background, different surfaces, and different orientations) and usability studies were performed to illustrate the efficacy of the R-MAP. Improved feedback and new functions were added based on usability study results.},

abstract = {The increase of aging people and the possibilities that are extended to the Internet users have led studies into improvement of web accessibility solutions for older people [30]. Most older adults present some decline in their cognitive, visual, hearing and motor skills [13]. Nowadays, however, the Web faces new technological challenges that extend the initial idea of cross-platform and inter-operational nature of the HTML and HTTP. The challenges are posed as accessibility barriers and consider the skills, capabilities, culture, languages, disabilities, among other characteristics related to the user as a human being, in contrast to the hardware and software requirements previously addressed. The human characteristics of the challenge can be seeing as the ultimate barrier of the initial Web requirements of cross-platform and inter-operational environment, and goes towards social inclusion of people whatever differences they might present in the Web. In this paper we propose the establishment of a new set of success criteria that address older users accessibility into the normative document of WCAG 2.0. The proposed recommendations were identified from a composition of usability studies with real older users and were tested for different scenarios.},

abstract = {We present a computational application to facilitate text chat-based communication between people with different cultural and language background. We focus on end-to-end communication between people with rudimentary and intermediary knowledge of the second language using computer support rather than using a simple connection with automated computer translation. Through a user-centered design process, involving three increasingly hifidelity prototypes, we created a system that allows users who speak different languages to send text messages between them that begins with an automated translation of their message that does a partial translation but normally has words that are not translated well. These poorly translated words are then searched for in a common sense knowledge base for the sender's culture that contains meanings gleaned from a large open source initiative to collect common sense knowledge. Using these additional concepts and words coupled to a translator, the user can select from a list of translations those that are better suited to the intention of the message. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach empirically to show that users find the augmented translated messages are culturally sensitive and provide better communication experiences than without it. Our study used messaging between Portuguese (Brazilian) and English speakers.},

abstract = {The development of interactive digital TV applications is hindered by the user-interaction options allowed when traditional remote controls are used. In this work, we describe the model of a software component that allows text entry in interactive TV applications based on an interface with multiple input modes --- the component offers a virtual keyboard mode, a cell keypad mode, and a speech mode. We discuss our considerations with respect to the design, development and evaluation of a prototype corresponding to our model, built according to the user-centered design methodology. After conducting a research on existing text input methods in television systems, we interviewed four experts in the interactive TV domain. We also applied 153 questionnaires to TV users, with the aim of gathering a user profile of users who make use of text entry mechanisms. During the development of the prototype, we conducted usability tests using the think aloud protocol, and usability inspections using the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The evaluations allowed the detection of both, a number of problems and of several improvement opportunities; at the same time that they highlighted the importance of using complementary text input modes in order to satisfy the needs of different users. Overall, the evaluation results suggest that the proposed approach provides a satisfactory level of usability by overcoming the limitations of text input in the context of user-interaction with interactive TV applications.},

Our particular research investigates interaction design within this field, taking into account relations hips with ubiquitous computing contexts, and applying knowledge from several disciplines, mainly Computer Music and Human-Computer Interaction. In this paper we propose using the concept of patterns in such multidisciplinary design context. Design patterns are, essentially, common solutions for specific design problems, which have been systematically collected and documented. Since they help designers, allowing them to reuse proven solutions within a certain domain, we argue that they can aid multidisciplinary design, facilitating communication and allowing knowledge transfer among team members of diverse fields. We illustrate our point by describing a set of musical interaction patterns that came out of our investigation so far, showing how they encapsulate Computer Music knowledge and how this was helpful in our own design process.},

abstract = {The demand for software in Ubiquitous Computing, in which access to applications occurs anywhere, anytime and from different devices, has raised new challenges for Software Engineering. One of these challenges is related to the adaptation of the contents of an application to the numerous devices that can access it in distinct contexts. Another challenge is related to the building of rich interfaces with multimedia content, asynchronous communication and other features that characterize Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). Searching for solutions focused on these challenges, a model-driven process for building rich interfaces of context-sensitive ubiquitous applications has been developed. The process, which is based on the conceptions of Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM), emphasizes the modeling reuse from a rich interface components metamodel. This metamodel provides a generic infrastructure for developing rich interfaces of applications, focusing on model-level reuse and on code generation for different Ubiquitous Computing platforms. In addition, the metamodel allows that the interface models are built by using the terms of rich interface domain, which facilitates the communication between users and developers.},

We believe this is due to the lack of tools to help designers find patterns and identify how they can be combined to solve user interface design problems. This paper proposes a flexible model to represent UIDPs and their relationships. The flexibility of our model, based on RDF Statements, is to provide a structure to the representation of the UIDPs in order to allow the development of tools to automate their use.},

In the educational area, the recommendation of relevant and interesting content can attract the student's attention, motivating her/him during the learning-teaching process. It is very important, thus, to know learner preferences to suggest suitable contents to the students. The goal of this work is to present an approach to design the student interaction based on the recommendation of e-learning content, determining a more suitable relationship between learning objects and learning profiles. In our proposal, the learning profile is split into categories to attend different student preferences during the teaching-learning process: perception, presentation-format and participation. Our recommendation uses these categories to filter out the most suitable learning objects organized according to the IEEE LOM standard. We present a prototype architecture named e-LORS, over which we perform demonstrative experiments.},

abstract = {Nowadays e-learning systems (ELSs) are used by a wide variety of students with different characteristics. Thus, adapting it to specific users, taking advantage of knowledge acquired and registered about them (the user's model, which in ELS domain is usually called student model) is an essential feature in order to improve usability and flexibility of ELSs. In fact, the use of personalization techniques aims at improving ELS usability since a personalized system automatically customizes the user interface, content, access rights, navigation, etc., considering the student model and each user may think that the system was designed specifically for him/her. This paper presents the context-aware and culture-oriented aspects of an adaptability approach designed for ELS. The main features of our approach are described and illustrated, showing how to use it to model context and culture for personalization of ELS, representing explicitly the rich context as an extension of traditional student modeling and making use of ontologies to model it.},

Second, we read and reviewed the numerous meta-analyses of distance education, multimedia, e-learning, and collaborative computing published over the last fifteen years [1--2, 4--6, 17, 25--27, 31, 33, 35]. Third, we performed our own meta-analysis of the abstracts of articles published in 10 peer-reviewed journals on distance learning and e-learning. Our goal in all these activities was to generate a list of significant topics or themes contained in publications about distance education and e-learning, in part to demonstrate the lack of consistent terminology.},

We report the main issues of access and findings obtained throughout the design process. Our findings revealed that iDTV applications must provide strategies to signalize interactive content without being obtrusive. Additionally, the context of the users must be taken into account, for instance by providing functionalities to enable collaborative interaction in learning groups, as well as mobilization affordances to encompass the different levels of technological literacy. Moreover, a recurrent issue that affected user experience was the proper synchronization of the live program with the interactive content.},

One of the main consequences is that service systems are often perceived as having human characteristics and usually expected to exhibit human-like behaviors. This talks presents and discusses those issues, under the light of Service Science and HCI theory. We also present the concept of the human facet of a service system, which is the set of elements and their configurations that create and control the perception of and the interaction of a user with the human characteristics of a service system. The talk then examines how the design of the human facet of service system can be simplified by theoretical insights from Psychological Models such Personality Theory, Social Psychology, and Emotional Communication Theory; and Dramatic models such as Character Theory, Stanislavski's System, Method Acting, and Illusion of Life.},
