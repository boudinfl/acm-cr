abstract = {Carroll's (1991) minimal manual has been considered an important advance in teaching first-time users the basics of computer programs. Unfortunately, it is not very clear what minimalism really means. Practitioners, for example, will find it difficult to create their own minimal manual because the principles of minimalism have not been described in enough detail (see Horn, 1992; Tripp, 1990). It is also not yet settled that a minimalist approach is the most effective one because critical experiments have hardly been conducted. This study therefore closely examines the minimalist principles and claims.This paper describes the basic ideas of minimalism, its design principles and how they can be operationalized. A parallel is drawn between a minimalist and constructivist perspective on learning and instruction. Like minimalism, constructivism places a high value on experience-based learning in context-rich environments. Like minimalism, it stresses the need to capitalize on the learner's prior knowledge as much as possible. And like minimalism, constructivists urge learners to follow their own plans and goals, to make inferences, and to abstract principles from what they experience (see Duffy &amp; Jonassen, 1991, 1992).An experiment is reported that examines the claims of minimalism. Strong and significant gains on several factors were found, all favoring the minimal manual over a control (conventional) manual. The discussion points to several issues that minimalism has yet to address.},

abstract = {The paper examines the extralinguistic factors that influence user behavior with online information systems. Extralinguistic factors include any interface features which are “outside” how users understand and comprehend written texts online. Extralinguistic features, therefore, are interface features that support (1) how users formulate their information goals or represent their tasks, (2) how users navigate to new or related topics of interest to them, and (3) how users quickly scan (rather than read) online information. It is argued that text comprehension is only one task that users engage in when using online information systems. A model of online user behavior that includes goal setting, navigating, scanning, and text comprehension is outlined. I argue that a broader definition of online information use is necessary and discuss various design principles for avoiding communication breakdowns beforeusers reach their desired information. Finally, I conclude by suggesting that a Participatory Design Approach to the design of human-computer interfaces is one method of undermining our tendency, as software designers, to apply design advice and guidelines without first accounting for user tasks and information goals.},

abstract = {Two of the recent developments in electronic documents are multimedia and hypermedia systems. Current multimedia systems are limited because they can not contain general third-party media in their documents. Hypermedia systems can only link documents together and cannot merge documents into compound documents.To overcome these limitations, we have implemented a prototype editor to create documents on the X Window system. Not only it opens a door for general third-party media tools to be integrated in documents, but it also allows users to compose compound documents with other documents. The corresponding metaphor for the manipulation of included media is fold-and-paste. The folded media are clipped by viewports and displayed by live processes that operate on the original  copies. The key technique used to provide these functions is embedded virtual screens. With the simple and powerful mechanism of embedded virtual screens, our editor is a multimedia and multisource document editor of an open architecture with regard to containing general media in its compound documents. it expands the capability in composing multimedia documents and it provides a simple mechanism to create documents that share some information with each other.},

The Zelig document management system is based on the definition of an only conceptual (i.e. abstract) document, which is mapped to several concrete documents, each used to fulfil a different communication goal. A prototype implementation of the Zelig system has been carried out within the MS-Windows environment.},

abstract = {The hypertext system “HyperMan” provides for an automatic conversion of linear machine–readable documents into hypertexts by applying text partitioning and link generation methods. After completion of the generation process, the graphical user interface of the system enables users to browse through the converted documents very easily. To determine whether user actions allow conclusions to be drawn about a generated hypertext, a special component that records user actions has been integrated into the system. In this way sequences of actions can be identified that provide hints of relationships between two document passages or between two terms that occur in the text. Then, the relationships can be stored as links or thesaurus entries, respectively, in the system's  data base and can be made available to subsequent users. In addition to acquiring relationships, the user observation component also provides for hints about the acceptance of system components. These hints can serve as a basis for further development of the system.},

Less than a megabyte in size, the controlling program permits a teacher with no formal computer training to prepare and modify all elements of the module—topics, subject matter, sequencing and the availability of computer tools and devices. The program displays all materials immediately and permits spontaneous and continuous modification in creation mode where lessons can be linked to each other in larger units, run separately and linked to any executable, batch or graphics files to permit easy integration of other CAL and computer facilities. Users work within, and can be tested on, each MENU lesson and students can become participants in  lesson creation and the preparation processes and of any text files within them. A “definition” option permits instructors to expand on and enrich terms within a file or globally throughout the lesson and to link ideas throughout the module.MENU is designed to run on very basic systems to support individuals in the preparation and learning of subject matter and to be integrated into large networks, with tutorial and mail facilities, for classes and students working on group projects. Hyperlinks permit connections among all levels of information and across topics. Help facilities are context-specific and can be created or modified by instructors at each point in the module. The creation elements include display screens, an ascii editor for both lesson creation and  as the medium through which instructors and users prepare information within the lessons. Instructors can adapt, modify and expand existing materials and link these to larger modules and all movement within the lesson is accomplished by the cursor. ESC and Enter keys or a mouse. The .dat file within the MENU program permits instructors to make direct connections to display files as their familiarity the creation process increases.MENU permits instructors to create materials specific to their needs and teaching style, to integrate existing lessons, tools and subject matter into modules relevant to their courses and to quickly incorporate students in the preparation of both subject matter and the structuring of lessons for their own projects and to prepare materials for other  classes.},

abstract = {Software professionals rely on internal documentation as an aid in understanding programs. Unfortunately, the documentation for most programs is usually out-of-date and cannot be trusted. Without it, the only reliable and objective information is the source code itself. Personnel must spend an inordinate amount of time exploring the system by looking at low-level source code to gain an understanding of its functionality. One way of producing accurate documentation for an existing software system is through reverse engineering. This paper outlines a reverse engineering methodology for building subsystem structures out of software building blocks, and describes how documenting a software system with views created by this process can produce numerous  benefits. It addresses primarily the needs of the software engineer and technical manager as document users.},

abstract = {Little is known about Hypertext writing style. This study examines the effects of link quantity and quality on usability. Our chosen domain is technical documentation which has a very regular writing style and organization. We compare two Hypertext Networks: one network has intuitively created links and the other is an algorithmic enhancement of it. The enhanced network has the same number of destination links, but more total link-anchors.Twelve subjects (six for each system) were asked to answer a set of eleven questions by navigating through the networks. We were interested in investigating three issues: efficiency (how many nodes need to be visited), speed (how much time is required) and accuracy (what is the error rate).Results showed that the lightly linked network required users to visit significantly more nodes to answer a question than the heavily linked equivalent. Heavy linking enabled users to find the answers to questions more quickly, but not significantly so. There was little difference in the error rate.},

abstract = {In developing an integrated document library for a NeXT LAN, we have experimented with multimedia applications and their implementation. In this paper we present results of this work including: issues of compression of different data types (e.g., voice, video, compound documents); demands placed on network bandwidth by multimedia documents in real-time, interactive use; processing loads generated by multimedia interactive use and impacts on perceived system performance; compound document and dynamically linked compound document file systems and their intra and internetwork transport; and real-time multimedia presentation durations determined by constraints of processing/storage requirements.Our experiments consisted of systematic measurements of multimedia specific     packets on the 10mb ethernet bandwidth and ethernet to ethernet via routers and FDDI backbone. In addition, we collected data on processor utilization by specific tasks of the multimedia applications and correlated these with traffic measurements.We empirically studied the impact on network bandwidth of multimedia implementations to evaluate the need for intra-network compression and the trade-offs between transmission times and processing requirements for dual-end compression/decompression approaches.From this work we, developed guidelines and specific requirements for the NeXT platforms used in our testing with respect to memory, magnetic and optical media, display technologies and other factors such as dual end compression. We also developed a model which allows  us to predict with some accuracy expected network loads, the processing demands placed on workstations and servers by multimedia implementations of different descriptions, and means of enhancing the performance of the system to accommodate these demands.These results provide a means of determining the hardware and software performance and configuration requirements of a specific type of multimedia implementation and, therefore, of the applicability or feasibility of multimedia technology for a particular application.As an example, library tutorial applications are high-level, focused on the look and feel of the library system, and make use of multimedia tools to convey these characteristics without placing large demands on the workstation processor server  processor, or bandwidth. On-line help for the library system is more detailed, solution-oriented, keyed to components of the application suite and conventional in approach except for the addition of hypertext features and limited graphics. The trend towards inclusion of multimedia documents in growing numbers and increased complexity within the library system will affect it significantly without improvements in performance and management of resources.},

Traditional methods of document design often prove inadequate for coping with the complexity of large online documentation projects.

The paper introduces the concepts of object-oriented design and their applicability to documentation, and suggests techniques for developing object-oriented documentation.},
