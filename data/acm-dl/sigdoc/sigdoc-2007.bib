abstract = {Genres exist within complex social structures, making them both the product and productive of that social structure. Consequently, any genre may be as active within the context of its social structure as are any human agents. This paper broadens the concept of genre to include what we call the genre field in the attempt to expand the definition of agent to include the genre-as-agent concept. Through the lens of play theory, this paper develops a grammar of genre fields as a heuristic for the understanding of genre's complex social structure. This grammar of genre fields includes the player-agent and genre-agent, the genre field, and the play scenario. To illustrate the use of the grammar of genre fields, this paper applies the grammar to two case studies; the first of which showcases genre within a dynamic social structure, the second of which demonstrates how rigid and formulaic genres can be when viewed within a static social structure.},

abstract = {Using activity theory and genre theory as bases for analysis, this article examines the activity of grouping in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft. The article first examines what grouping does in the overall context of the game, including its socialization and gameplay functions. Grouping involves a series of interactions and conventions that structure gameplay objectives and model expected behavior. Groups are formed through specific interfaces in the game that enact social networking processes and can be examined comparatively alongside web-based social networking technologies. By looking at interface design, the article identifies how grouping as an activity is mediated and what social expectations are put in place when players participate in groups.Next, the article considers the role of other texts in the activity system of grouping, focusing on two examples: the game FAQ and message board. The FAQ is especially noteworthy as an instance of player-produced technical writing. Players write FAQs to document basic game information, present game strategies and walkthroughs, and help other players solve problems. As a genre, this type of FAQ is characterized by a number of tensions that can productively challenge how we think about the conventions of electronic and printed text. FAQ writers make different kinds of rhetorical moves that situate the text within the larger activity of gaming and outline specific purposes and audiences. The FAQ is also examined here in the context of message board interaction, which is used in part for more localized discourse that the FAQ does not address specifically. Working at various levels of abstraction and consolidation, this system of online texts mediates group activity and provides a space for extra-game interactions to directly influence the in-game interactions and behaviors of players (and vice versa).},

abstract = {This paper describes the use and design of gestures for online virtual environment interactions. Virtual Environments (VEs), are three dimensional virtual worlds that combine sound, text, and gestures in computer-mediated communication (CMC) processes. In VEs, communication can be done through text-based CMC such as instant messaging and chat, but also through additional gestural, visual, proxemic and deictic non-verbal channels. For this reason, VEs require an understanding of the impact of gestures in various contexts. This paper will outline common CMC medium affordances as related to VEs and discuss the importance of using gestures in various online communication contexts. In doing so, this paper will explore the issues that may influence the design and use of gestures for specific professional communication purposes. Because gestures may serve in addressing intercultural contexts and have informational and cognitive communicative benefits within virtual environments, this paper will end with an exploration of specific gesture designs that may help facilitate their use by professional communicators.},

I further argue that researchers in Rhetoric and Writing Studies are particularly well positioned to write and/or co-create sympatric course platforms.},

We introduce the concept of ordered partition for sequencing, and the ordered product of partitions, when it is necessary to combine more than one preference orderings. In our context, ordered partitions originate from preferences expressed over general relations, rather than on functional attributes of traditional database tuples (or objects) addressed by other approaches. We believe that the proposed framework is expressive enough to produce course sequences from descriptions expressed in diverse data models (e.g., XML, RDF/S) with respect to a variety of user preferences, also including priorities over the preferences.},

abstract = {The design of large software systems requires designers to apply critical thinking skills to resolve the complex design problems these systems typically generate. Cultivating these skills in novice designers involves exposing them to the complexities of these problems, allowing them to critically explore the problem and application domains, and providing a means to communicate the rationales for the design decisions they make. In a classroom learning environment, the processes students use to think about and organize what they know and do not know about the design problems is more important to the students' learning than the artifacts they generate. Effectively communicating to the instructor why they make their decisions facilitates assessment and feedback on the thinking and organizing process, and enhances the learning experience. This paper presents a pattern or template for capturing and communicating this information in a concise yet information-rich format. The author's experience using this pattern in a teaching and learning context is discussed to validate the effectiveness of this pattern.},

abstract = {Providing communication in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an instigating development challenge, due to the high complexity of these systems and to the difficulty of modeling them properly. This paper presents a model of an architecture to represent the structure of a GIS. The architecture is based on standard technologies, such as XML, XSLT and SVG. These technologies are used to represent GIS and to provide functional and device interoperability. Moreover, web services are used for exchanging information between systems used by different devices in different contexts. The proposed architecture is transparent to users and provides information adaptation to different devices using context information. The main contributions of the proposed architecture is the geographic representation using SVG, the functional and device interoperability and cartographic generalization.},

abstract = {In today's global software engineering projects, where development activities are distributed geographically and temporally, it is increasingly important for CASE tools to maintain the information (both syntactic and semantic) captured in the design models. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto standard for modeling software applications and UML diagrams serve as graphical documentations of the software system. The interoperability of UML modeling tools is important in supporting the model exchange. Tool interoperability is often implemented using XML Metadata Interchange (XMI). Unfortunately, there is a loss of fidelity of the design documentation when transforming between UML and XMI due to the compatibility of different versions of UML, XMI and add-on proprietary information, which hinder reuse. This paper reports on an ongoing study evaluating the interoperability of UML modeling tools by assessing the quality of XMI documents representing the design. Case studies in the paper demonstrate a framework of preserving the fidelity of UML models data when importing and exporting different UML models in a distributed heterogeneous environment.},

abstract = {In an information system, if data-entry agents (authors) do not understand properly the intentions of the designer of the structure they are populating (the modeler), they can make errors, resulting in incomplete or incorrect information entering the system. Thus, modeler-author communication is of prime importance in the performance of a system. Intertextual Semantics (IS) is a semantic framework for structured-document, based on natural language, intended to facilitate the communication of the modeler's intentions to interface designers and authors. In IS, the modeler prepares peritexts (text-before and text-after segments) in natural language, that help understanding the contents of an element (or field) by putting it in the appropriate context. The experience reported here is the application of IS to the development of an exchange format between funeral homes and cemeteries. The issues raised by the use of this approach are discussed.},

abstract = {As the number of users using web-based applications increases, online help systems are required to provide appropriate information in multiple formats and accesses. Since users are dealing with various applications simultaneously so as to complete objectives and make daily decisions, it is necessary to provide anytime, anywhere help or tutorials. However, developing effective and efficient help systems on behalf of users is costly. As geographically distributed and multilingual users with minimal training or interruption have increased significantly, it has become a requirement to restructure help systems. In order to meet users' requirements and business challenges, it is necessary to restructure help systems to deliver training, documentation, and online help while taking into account nonfunctional requirements such as usability, time-to-market, quality and maintainability. In this paper we try to overcome such technical and economic constraints through single sourcing and content reuse, embrace as many users as possible by HTML-based help systems, and beef up help contents through unified and structural help system design. In addition, network pipe method for user feedback data collection and statistical analysis has been suggested as user feedback automation.},

The CWRL's website has long been an important resource for computers and writing scholarship, but in 2004, it faced new challenges. On one hand, the site had to conform to new accessibility guidelines, guidelines that are sometimes difficult to follow. On the other hand, the site's users ranged from expert HTML coders to neophytes, all of whom had knowledge to contribute. These two factors had caused a severe bottleneck with the previous, static website, causing delays and leading to slow site development. The CWRL's solution was to use an open-source content management system to develop a new site in which accessibility guidelines are programmed and enforced, allowing anyone with an account to contribute accessible portions to the site while retaining centralized control over the site's web standards. I conclude with thoughts about open systems and their potential to improve accessible, distributed site development in similar organizations.},

abstract = {Narrative-based writing is a technique that was developed to address the lack of support for document coherence. The technique depends on the production of a story-like executive summary of the document called a DN (Document Narrative). This is then analysed using a discourse theory called Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) which helps further to correct any lapses in coherence in the DN before proceeding to use it to write the document. Previous papers have described the technique briefly, alongside discussions of the ongoing software development to incorporate narrative support in writing tools. It has now become apparent that the technique itself needs to be explained in greater detail. This is the purpose of this paper. Here, narrative-based writing and the reasoning behind it is described. This is followed by a description of a user experiment conducted in May 2006 to evaluate narrative-based writing and discover areas in which it could be improved. The positive feedback from the volunteers has motivated us to continue to refine and simplify the technique.},

abstract = {Workplace collaborators make use of diverse types of documents and other resources. Traditionally, each type of document has been stored in its own repository, and people have had to manage multiple documents in multiple storage services. Workplace collaborators often have complex, ad hoc working relations that are partially executed through their shared documents. Traditionally, dependencies among documents and other objects have gone unrecorded, or have been stored in a piecemeal manner inside the documents, or have been objectified and rigidified in workflow engines. Workplace collaborators often need to coordinate with one another, both asynchronously and in real-time, and often in the context of their shared documents. Traditionally, people had no idea of the status of their collaborators, or they have had to consult other, unrelated services for awareness or presence information about their colleagues.We aim to change that. I will describe our research, findings, and possible futures of systems and services that are intended to unify the ways that people collaborate with and through shared documents. In our ActivityExplorer project, users innovated new ways of using our software, showing that a service with collections of shared documents, fine-grained access control, persistent communications, and real-time status information could serve diverse needs of a workplace of individuals, teams, and communities. Our Unified Activity Management project explored the harvesting of collective enactments, and their crystallization into work practices templates and rich placeholders for future collaborations. These ideas have led to successful technology transfer, and are making their way into products.In the course of this work, we sometimes found that simple ideas were much more popular than expected, paradoxically creating new challenges for users. I will describe two of those challenges, and our attempts to meet them. This new research has led us into domains of interruption management, machine learning, and very much into social computing, including technology transfer into another generation of collaboration products.People work together through direct communication and through shared documents. At every turn, people surprise us with their ingenuity and their ability to create new human and technological solutions with the systems that we offer them. I will close with a discussion of the concept of reinvention (innovation through usage), and how technology developers and users can learn from one another through cycles of development and usage, with innovative contributions from all parties at each turn of the cycle.},

abstract = {This paper provides an initial examination of discourses used to resist and destabilize change after change has been initiated within a social network. The study examines an email exchange among association members in which one member offered a proposal for changing the way members post email to their list serve. In the proposal, the writer employed one discourse of usability and claimed it to be the dominant (and only) form for the field. As that specific discourse began to stabilize, other actors entered the conversation to destabilize both the change and the conversation that enabled the possibility of change. The result of these exchanges was a reinforcement of the very forms the agent of change attempted to challenge. Examining the relative stability of each contribution to the email conversation, the study shows that opposition was enacted only once the change appeared to stabilize. The case describes one example of the competing discursive aggregations that constitute organizational networks and the forms enacted by discourses of change.},

abstract = {In this paper, I analyze marketing materials - principally brochures - from two cochlear implant manufacturers. Cochlear implants occupy a central place in the debates over deafness. Is deafness merely a medical condition that prevents deaf people from fully participating in the (hearing) society at large? Or is Deafness (written with a capital D) the moniker of a minority group, one with its own distinct language (e.g. American Sign Language), history, culture, and values, and thus deserving of the same civil rights afforded to other linguistic minorities? Because implants promise to eradicate deafness, they also threaten to undermine the claims of some deaf people to self-realization as members of a linguistic minority group. Not surprisingly, the marketing materials embrace a medical model of deafness as a stigmatizing deficit to be fixed. But they do so by downplaying the implant's uncertainty (i.e. implants to date can not deliver on the promise to cure deafness for all) and by ignoring the contests within the Deaf community over the place of implants in the lives of d/Deaf people.},

abstract = {Usability inspection methods, such as heuristic evaluation, the cognitive walkthrough, formal usability inspections, and the pluralistic usability walkthrough, were introduced fifteen years ago. Since then, these methods, analyses of their comparative effectiveness, and their use have evolved in different ways. In this paper, we track the fortunes of the methods and analyses, looking at which led to use and to further research, and which led to relative methodological dead ends. Heuristic evaluation and the cognitive walkthrough appear to be the most actively used and researched techniques. The pluralistic walkthrough remains a recognized technique, although not the subject of significant further study. Formal usability inspections appear to have been incorporated into other techniques or largely abandoned in practice. We conclude with lessons for practitioners and suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {In this paper, I make the case that User-Centered Design (UCD) principles, specifically those principles that view design through the lens of distributed usability, should be at the center of research into how organizations determine and value writing work. Based in activity theory, my argument for such an approach is that UCD principles, grounded in notions of Distributed Usability, function well as a research method to determine organizational values that may be invisible or ill defined. Activity theory as it currently stands contains but does not foreground what and how an organization values as good writing for a particular situation. By using activity theory and distributed usability to develop what I call a Distributed Value System Matrix, organizations would be able to see how differing documents may be doing the same work within and between different contexts. Such knowledge should be of great value for smaller organizations where members often engage in a variety of writing tasks and for professional writers who move project to project, context to context. I include a brief example of what such a research project looks like in an academic context.},

At the conclusion of the interview, we created an Affinity Diagram to analyze the issues that we observed.After performing an analysis of the tasks conducted by the users that we observed during the contextual inquiry, in addition to the context in which they are performed, we conducted a scenario-based usability study in which participants were given a set of tasks to complete for each of our proposed redesigns of the CivicInfo BC Web site. Users were asked to "think aloud" while working through each task. The purpose of the think aloud method is to gain an understanding of the participants thought processes, expectations, and how they came to make their decisions.The study was conducted by Alan Rosenthal using Microsoft Live Meeting. The use of Live Meeting enabled Marcia Peterson and Rob MacDonald to participate remotely in the usability study via conference call. Screen activity was also recorded using Camtasia Recorder.},
