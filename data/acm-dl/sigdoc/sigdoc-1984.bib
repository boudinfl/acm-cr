abstract = {The file descriptor is a data structure that describes or documents the characteristics (position type, initial value, etc.) of the information within a file. Each file containing information possesses a unique file descriptor. The file descriptors for a collection of related files are stored together in a file named DESCRIPTORS.This paper explains the use of the file descriptor for:answering general queries to a file- “retrieve all records satisfying predicate P” This is embodied in a tool called the consultator.a general tool for data input - the capturer - wich allows inputting appropriate data for any file.a tool for report production - the report printer - which allows design of arbitrary output reports.a specification for transformations from several input files into one or more output files - the file transformer - and its corresponding tool (program to interpret such notation).The above tools allow for input, consultation or retrieval, transformations (“computation” or “processing” of data into results) among files, and report generation, all of these without writing programs in high level languages (Pascal, Cobol,...). Instead, we use a simpler description of (a) the screen to be presented for inputting data; (b) the query or predicate; (c) the transformation; (d) the report.The description used in (a) through (d) can be considered as a concise language for specifying data-manipulation (v. gr, administrative or managerial) tasks. If the tools prove to be useful, one can expect considerable savings in the time and effort spent in specifying and programming such data-manipulation tasks. The system in being implemented in Pascal for an IBM-PC network.},

abstract = {We present as a practical case the payroll system developed for the Education Planning and Culture Offices of the Ministry of Public Education. It is the old payroll problem, but payment normativity in the Mexican government and the characteristics of the education sector involve greater complexity.Because the system is for employees' payment, it is important that any modification to the system be done as soon as possible (not more than a week) and with maximum reliability to get the expected results. With these considerations in mind, one of the principal objectives at the beginning of the project was that documentation must be good enough to permit a programmer to become familiar with the system and perform maintenance easily and accurately, even if he or she was not a member of the team that developed it.},

abstract = {It is well known that a programmer's main idea is to generate results, but these are often only partially done. Generally, they want to finish the program well to document it afterwards; however, they never do so. Sometimes they are assigned to a new project, and they expect to have an opportunity to document what they have written at a later date. Other times, programmers have their own ideas, like ownership or professional secrets, and so on and so forth, but the truth is, few programmers document their programs, and fewer document them well.If there is a method that allows the programmer to document before writing a program or while he is writing it, such a program will, obviously, be documented in the most proper manner.This paper will describe some experiences in using the method of J.D. Warnier to design programs, and, therefore, its graphs are used as documentation.},
