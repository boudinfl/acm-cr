abstract = {Lightweight DITA (LwDITA) is a proposed standard and methodology for authoring intelligent technical content. LwDITA aims to ease adoption of the open standard Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) in industry and academia by reducing its dependence on robust XML structures and allowing authors to develop content in a variety of markup languages. LwDITA is designed after three primary authoring formats: 1) a subset of DITA XML elements aimed at an audience of technical communicators (XDITA), 2) an HTML5 format for web content creators (HDITA), and 3) a Markdown format for developers and plain-text aficionados (MDITA). LwDITA is still under development, but some plugins compatible with the DITA Open Toolkit make it functional enough for evaluation and early adoption.},

Gamification is nowadays applied to several areas, such as learning, computer science, business, marketing, tourism, among others. However, we need to understand to what extent it is studied in academic context. We present a bibliographic study on gamification research, by identifying publications trends. This paper presents the gamification related areas, result from a publication keyword analysis of the scientific publications on gamification. In this paper, we also identify the game elements, game mechanics, and game dynamics, used as part of any gamification implementation. In this study are also present the most used gamification theoretical models.},

We suggest ways teachers and practitioners should consider shifting our assumptions about the writing/content development process and modifying how we prepare our students for this kind of work in the classroom.},

Specific entities that coalesce into such assemblages include users, environments, technologies, networks, hardware, software, corporations, ideologies, and data structures. This paper proposes Levi Bryant's [11] onto-cartography as a framework for depicting emergent assemblage agency across four aspects of online search: 1) search and its results page; 2) the content of search results; 3) the searcher's research literacy; and 4) the ambient environment of the search session. The paper suggests methods to be used for studying emergent agency and encourages technical communicators to engage in studies that identify and trace rhetorical agency, especially in post-human assemblages of human and nonhuman actants.},

The growing prevalence of crowdsourcing is creating new and complex contexts for communication, prompting a need to more fully understand how these arrangements can best be sustained for and by their participants and stakeholders. I draw on an ethnographic study of LibriVox.org---a volunteer audiobook publishing project---to argue that such large communities of makers necessitate a unique understanding of usability: one where, instead of flawless consumer experiences, a more important, long-term goal is to cultivate good, empowering user experiences for makers. Through surveying four central sites of user-generated LibriVox documentation, I learn how this decentralized maker community offers its volunteers multiple and flexible paths toward valuable instances of user-as-maker agency.},

To explore design possibilities, we conducted a series of participatory design sessions with teens to envision the design of a social robot to measures stress. The findings from the study include how teens react to existing robots, how teens conceptualize robots that might live in their schools through storyboarding and group discussion, and reactions to an emerging design of a low fidelity robot. In our discussion, we reflect on implications for designing social robots for and with teens, considerations for studying engaging relationships, and reflections on methodological choices of participatory design.},

This paper suggests that narrative elements are common features of technical communication on the website with the exception of several genres. Furthermore, this paper affirms prior research that situates Instructables.com as representative of larger DIY "maker" communities, in which technical experts from academia, industry, and hobbyists engage in technical communication. It provides additional evidence that women are being excluded from such communities, and are most represented by their use of traditionally feminine-gendered technologies and techniques such as sewing, jewelry, and fashion.},

However, it is relevant to investigate whether Tinder enables women's empowerment and how the user-mobile device interaction and the graphical user interface bear upon gender dynamics. Forty women were interviewed and the findings show that Tinder is not meeting women's expectations, rather it is stimulating the objectification of women. Considering that online dating is a growing trend and that it can be a revolutionary tool to connect people, we analysed the interface and pointed out some issues that should be considered to enhance women's experience.},

This paper, poses an alternative approach using an experiment that compares audemes, a type of non-speech sounds, with alternative text delivered using synthetic speech. In a pilot study with fourteen sighted users, findings show that audemes perform better across many areas. Specifically, audemes required lower mental and temporal demands and led to less effort and frustration and better task performance. Moreover, participants recognized audemes with higher accuracy and lower errors. Audemes were also perceived as more engaging compared to alternative text delivered using synthetic speech. Additionally, audemes were found to be richer in delivering information. This study suggests that non-speech sounds could substitute or complement alternative text when describing images on the Web.},

abstract = {The research paper describes mixed-methods Experience Design research instruments that investigate the relationship between cross-cultural identity and location. Qualitative research instruments were designed to initially locate connections between conceptions of the self and symbolic pathways, and then to push out from conceptual paths to find boundaries and key connections between them. This paper details qualitative research into how an African university deploys place-based identity through its website, and how university students navigate through the university portal to desired information. This research uncovered whether the structure of a website reinforced audience notions of place through their use of metaphor, image, and navigation cues. The paper outlines the creation of the research instrument, discusses how early data collection guided later data collection, and finally details how these methods solicit users to define the significance of the data during research method shifts.},

This study investigates whether the shape of typeface can influence the perception of a message. We manipulated the appearance of typefaces' neotenic cues, and measured whether that affects a reader's perception of a story as true. The results indicate that the look and feel of a typeface doesn't change the judgment of the trustworthiness of a message, but that the visual cues influenced the subjective confidence in a reader's judgment.},

It minimizes implementation time, automates manual tasks, requires little programming skills, and modularizes the embedded content, keeping the code base clean.This experience report outlines the lightweight in-app messaging model and reviews several in-app messaging solutions for their feature set, ease of implementation, and ease of maintaining embedded content.

We conducted an analysis of individual branches of LTUX and collected and analyzed survey and interview data with practitioners in various cities across 7 countries, all of which led directly to positive changes in the leadership and communication strategies for Ladies that UX. Through this project, Ladies that UX used university-conducted research to develop and institute new methods of communication, online learning programs, regions co-locating member meet-ups, and other positive changes. In this report, we suggest that UX research and application should be developed from "collaborative, iterative, and intense" (Ratcliffe and McNeill, 2012, p.10) dialogue among researchers and practitioners.},

Logistical challenges and lessons learned are described. Inspired by increased attention to ethics within the computer science academic community and technical communication scholarship connecting power, ethics, and user-centered technology, this writing activity asks students to evaluate and explain a user's risk after a breach or exploit. I argue that the rhetorical concepts of audience and nomos are effective vehicles for engaging students toward a more user-focused ethical awareness within a computer science context. In his recent Call to Action, Wolf (Vice Chair of ACM's Committee on Professional Ethics) echoes this need to complicate an understanding of users with an ethical focus, quoting Updated Code Imperative 3.4: "The needs of people---including users ... should always be a central concern in professional computing [1]."},

Also, the use of prediction-based mechanisms are scarce due to the interference caused by eyes being very sensitive to various stimuli that may appear on the screen, which interfere in the identification of users' actual intentions. In our work we present an eye-typing tool for Brazilian Portuguese language which provides word recommendation. Our results show that our method for eye-typing in Portuguese domain achieved equivalent speed rates to existing methods for the English language. Moreover, suggested options are widely used by users.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report applying participatory design research on the development of effective privacy compliance framework in the context of healthcare applications provided to IT designers. We aim to bridge the gap between privacy law designers and privacy IT designers by expanding the concept of end-user participation. We propose a mixed approach between Participatory Design Research and Human Computer Interaction techniques to facilitate the participation of different stakeholders during the design lifecycle.},

abstract = {To better understand design deficiencies, it is necessary to expand the traditional representation of quantitative data to include a qualitative facet. In this poster we present a schema for visualizing this enhanced data set: coded and standardized information culled from video recordings. The goal is to expand our understanding of usability test results by including the test participants' thoughts and feelings about the tasks they were attempting. The methodology consists of coding video data to create a prototype for visualization from the data set. By creating a standardized method of coding these expanded data for visualization, usability researchers will be able to more seamlessly identify and report usability problems.},

abstract = {This poster demonstrates the use of an experimental web application, the Cycletron, for the rhetorical analysis of written discourse. The Cycletron is conceptually parallel to a tool like Google's n-gram viewer [1] in that it allows users to track the usage of key terms in a text. The Cycletron departs from the n-gram viewer in its use of network graph centrality measures to identify these key terms in a natural language text and its novel visualization of results, which at root, attempts to disentangle and flatten the complexity of the network graph representations offered by tools such as Gephi. The development of the Cycletron was informed Bakhtin's [3] theory of dialogism, Ridolfo and DeVoss' [4] theory on rhetorical velocity, network graph theory, and North American genre theory. Consequently, this article will explain how theory and design cohere in the Cycletron app and argue for its theory-building.},

abstract = {"Gamification" research has evolved and grown dramatically in recent years, gaining popularity across disciplines. While such efforts have generated headway in many respects, and in various directions, from conceptual understandings to user studies, the field could benefit from more work focused upon use in research methodologies at the nexus of practice and theory. This paper, in turn, reflects upon such an experiment aimed at the design and application of gamification techniques within a typical technical-communication context. In this case, subject matter experts within the National Park Service were being asked to improve accessibility of their site brochures by audio describing them. During this training, they were given an overview of audio description, as a process, as well as introduced to a prototype web tool and then asked to use that tool to create the description for their site brochure. Unlike previous training exercises with other parks in this project, though, this group also was organized by sites into a tournament bracket, in which pairs of parks competed against each other in exercises designed to create comparable audio description. The winner of each round, as determined by an independent panel of judges, advanced to the next round, spurred by the promise of fun Hawaiian-themed prizes at the end. This gamification strategy appeared to generate more data, and more research-focused data, than the previous training exercises we have offered, per user. It also apparently engaged many, in various evident ways. But it also seemed to disenfranchise some as well, who dropped out of this voluntary training, creating a mix of results, which will be outlined in this paper.},
