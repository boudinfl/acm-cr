One approach to co-generation of text and graphics uses a single logical specification; a second approach starts with CAD-based representation and produces a corresponding textual account. This paper explores these two different approaches, reports the results of using prototypes embodying the approaches to represent simple figures, and discusses issues that were identified through use of the prototypes. While it appears feasible to co-generate text and graphics automatically, the process raises deep issues of design of communications, including the intent of the producer of the documentation.},

abstract = {With the U.S. government's new requirement for accessibility, companies such as IBM, are revising their method of selling products and solutions to ensure compliance. The delivery mechanism for information must be accessible to all users, including users with vision, hearing, motor, or cognitive disabilities.Users consume information from many different sources. An increasingly popular method of distributing information is using computers and the Internet. The Web houses volumes of documents and graphics available to anyone at any time. Paired with assistive technology such as Home Page Reader, the Internet makes information that would otherwise be restrictive accessible.However, as approachable as the Internet may be with its sheer volume of information, it does have limitations. The old saying about a chain, that it is only as good as its weakest link, aptly describes the Internet. Beside problems with retrievability and searchability, many other issues plague this vehicle of information. No matter how sophisticated HTML, DHTML, XHTML, and XML present information, the graphics within the body text are the weakest link, from the viewpoint of users with visual or cognitive impairments.This presentation is divided into two sections and explores how a method of creating and exporting graphics can improve the experiences of users with visual or cognitive impairments when viewing technical documentation:  Clear, concise, and well-structured diagrams enable better comprehension for the cognitively impaired suffering from dyslexia and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD).The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) solution addresses many challenges for visually impaired people.},

abstract = {To be successful, any engineering product should accomplish the needs and expectations of its potential stakeholders. Similarly, design models should be defined taking into account goals and requirements of their users, i.e. the practitioners who daily conceive, develop and deploy applications. Neglecting stakeholders' needs can bring to lack of attention towards these engineering products (design models) while fitness to requirements can drastically increase their acceptability in the real world. This paper focuses on the domain of Communication and Interaction Intensive applications (C&amp;II applications) by presenting a suite of two conceptual models (namely IDM and E-WOOD) belonging to a more comprehensive methodological framework addressing the analysis and design of such a kind of applications. The focus of the paper is not on the presentation of the methods but on highlighting their fitness to the requirements of the potential adopters of such methods. To this end, the overall framework has been defined on the basis of an accurate analysis of potential stakeholders' goals and requirements gained from our training experience to professional designers and from adoption of our previous conceptual methods in several real-life projects.},

A discussion of these issues has recently been presented in [1]. This paper takes these issues further by considering 'EthnoModel' as an approach to generalisation of the method to any system demonstrating these features.},

abstract = {The creation process of technical documentation is an expensive and time-consuming task especially for complex products. To make this process more cost-efficient computerized support is required. Furthermore new technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality will be increasingly used to visualize repair manuals or operating instructions in the future adding even more to the authoring process. The availability of a suitable authoring environment will be a precondition for the deployment of technical documentations based on these new technologies. Reusing data from the engineering process in an adequate way seems to be a viable means to augment technical authoring. However, the available CAD data lacks necessary information being obligatory for the authoring process. E.g. there is no dismantling information on screws or other peripheral equipment around the CAD-components. This gap can be filled by specific metadata which augments the engineering data. This paper provides a model for such metadata and gives an overview of the possibilities this approach for the authoring of technical documentations.},

In this article, we present the results of a survey of software maintainers to try to establish what documentation artifacts are the most useful to them.},

abstract = {The use of eBooks and interactive multimedia in technical documentation is an emerging and important trend for delivering abstract and complex technical information that is enticing, engaging, and -most important of all- effective. With the substantial (and growing) number of documents available electronically, it is a non-trivial task for technical writers to even reach their target audience, let alone engage them. Both eBooks and interactive multimedia feature unique characteristics that serve two important functions: piquing the interest in the user, and aiding in the transmittal of complex technical information. Further, the use of eBooks and interactive multimedia in technical documentation helps to differentiate from the myriad other technical documents. At the IBM Toronto Software Laboratory, the Media Design Studio (MDS) works collaboratively with the information development community to produce graphics and diagrams for technical documentation. This paper explores alternative forms of IBM technical documentation in the form of two case studies-one an eBook and the other a Macromedia Flash-based interactive multimedia presentation. Both projects were co-developed by the writers and graphic designers, with a mandate to create a rich, graphical approach to entice and engage users to read and understand complex technical concepts.},

abstract = {It is difficult to present new, complex ideas in ways that are informative and interesting in situations where a vast amount of information has to be delivered and understood quickly. Given short attention spans, boredom thresholds and limited capacity to assimilate new information, it is essential to use an effective conveyor of the message, which presents the content in a clear and unambiguous manner whilst helping the receiver to remain alert and focused and integrate the information with existing knowledge. This paper introduces a collaboration between computer scientists and artists to develop an effective, animation based information communication tool, in the form of an application scenario, to be used for communicating to students (and wider audiences) dry technical aspects of Pervasive Computing.},

Each organization within an enterprise can design and implement a process that encompasses these best practices. And there are software development tools that enable each best practice.This paper describes the six best practices, the tools that enable them, and demonstrates how they can be applied to information development, as well as other all components of software development.This paper also provides an example that illustrates how documentation groups or organizations can benefit by following these best practices to ensure success for information development projects.},

abstract = {Current requirements analysis methodologies for web applications fail to capture important elements of the requirements picture. On the one hand, there is the need for modelling the assumptions of a stakeholder which dictate her "weltanschauung" on the design (we call these "visions"). From properly eliciting stakeholder visions, important goals and requirements for the design may arise. On the other hand, we also need to better understand the emotional, psychological, social or individual elements which can trigger a person to use an interactive application (we call these "user motivations"). User motivations - properly combined with stakeholder visions - are key to derive a sound set of user requirements. This paper extends existing achievements in goal-based requirements analysis for communication-intensive web applications by introducing the concepts of vision and user motivation. These new elements provide web analysts and designers with a methodological support to interpret and carry out requirements analysis in complex situations. A case study excerpted from a real web design project is used to show possible uses of the concepts discussed.},

abstract = {Theoretical and technological progress has revived the interest in the design of services for the support of co-located human-human communication and collaboration, witnessing the start of several large-scale projects over the last few years. Most of these projects focus on meetings and/or lecture situations. However, user-centred design and evaluation frameworks for co-located communication and collaboration are a major concern. In this paper, we summarise the prevalent approaches towards user-centred design and evaluation, and we develop two different services. In one service, participants in a small-group meeting receive real-time feedback about observable properties of the meeting that are directly related to the social dynamics, such as individual amount of speaking time or eye-gaze patterns. In the other service, teachers in a classroom receive real-time feedback about the activities and attention level of participants in the lecture. We also propose ways to address the different dimensions that are relevant to the design and evaluation of these services (the individual, the social and the organisational dimension), bringing together methods from different disciplines.},

abstract = {The Sensorium family of games provides a platform and environment for multiplayer games in a pervasive environment. Each player is equipped with a mote, which (along with those of other players) is an element in a wireless sensor network. Sensorium games are pervasive in the truest sense: that is, sensory events in the environment trigger events in the game. For example, walking under a light may cause a loss of game lives.In this paper, we describe the Sensorium game platform and Trove, an implemented game which is a member of the Sensorium family. We describe our experiences of player Trove and heuristic evaluations of its usability.},

abstract = {Testing of usability could perhaps be more accurately described as testing of learnability. We know more about the problems of novice users than we know of the problems of experienced users. To understand how these problems differ, and to understand how usability problems change as users change from novice to experienced, we conducted a longitudinal study of usability among middle-school teachers creating Web sites. The study looked at the use both the use of documentation and the underlying software, tracking the causes and extent of user frustration over eight weeks. We validated a categorization scheme for frustration episodes. We found that over the eight weeks the level of frustration dropped, the distribution of causes of frustration changed, and the users' responses to frustration episodes changed. These results suggest that the sorts of errors that are most prominently featured in conventional usability testing are likely of little consequence over longer periods of time.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a study that is concerned with the cognitive aspects of reading in a hypertext environment. The study focuses on text based electronic documents. A cognitive model for hypertext document reading proposed in an earlier work is here developed and validated with the use of think aloud protocols. Navigational strategies that readers employ in hypertext reading and hypertext links' selection are also under study. The results indicate that 100% of the task related data correspond to the components of the cognitive model, allowing us to conclude that the proposed model sufficiently describes the cognitive processes involved in hypertext reading. In addition, three navigational strategies are revealed, linear, mixed, and mixed review. The quantitative data show no significant differences between different reading goals on comprehension and on the amount of text read.},
