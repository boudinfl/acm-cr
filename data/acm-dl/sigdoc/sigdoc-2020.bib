abstract = {Due to the unique history of web development, related training is scattered throughout the university. As the profession's requirements have become increasingly complex and interdisciplinary, however, it is unlikely that students in any unit attain professional-level skills. For these reasons, more work is needed to usefully articulate the relationship between web development topics and core disciplinary theories and perspectives. This report focuses on web development in communication programs. Pointing specifically to the growing prominence of JavaScript frameworks such as React and of the role of the full-stack developer, I raise concerns related to agency and the extent to which communication students can contribute to shaping online content and suggest that a focus on document genres and content modeling might usefully bridge the core concerns of communication scholars with the professional activities of web developers.},

We take a closer look at how this intersection of technology and design both limits and enhances the documentation design and translation processes. This report also examines the role of the technical writer in the translation process, how the writer's documentation design decisions impact the machine translation process, and how the writer should be influenced by the translation process as a whole. This report discusses several methods that can be used by technical writers to write clear and concise content for both human and machine translation. Taking a proactive approach to writing for a global audience makes the translations process more efficient and increases content quality.},

Ideally, whether your customers are using a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, consistent experience is crucial to a product's success. We want the users to have a memorable, intuitive, and enjoyable experience.The challenges stem from the multitude of available products on the market, the constant evolvement of our daily interfaces, and the innovative solutions that contribute to the new digital age. There is also a need to deliver products faster to give the advantage to companies that bring their solutions first.The information overload does make it more difficult to identify what is relevant. We raise bars every day for quality of products, efficiency and feature rich modules. Just like in any competitive markets, the customer is always right, in the world of digital, the end user defines what works and what does not. One of the areas that makes or breaks the success of the digital product is branded user-friendly experience. We need design systems to deliver just that, which we will discuss here.},

In reference to produced documentation, the need for technical communicators to explore alternative formats is such that the traditional operating manual may not be sufficient to fully account for the complexities of automated and digitally-augmented manufacturing systems. Documentation processes, then, must account for collaborative, distributed work approaches, as well as those of technology transfer in the composition and distribution of documentation in support of postindustrial, advanced manufacturing},

abstract = {This study proposes how user experience designers can approach embodied cognition to design digital music tools. Designing digital tools for music is challenging because the individual's creative process involves bodily movement. The act of learning a musical instrument is embodied, where knowledge is gained through sensorimotor processes and emotions from music are analogous to physical emotions felt in the body [1,2,3]. In this study, design ethnography research was conducted with Pro ToolsTM in order to find users’ mental model on how people learn to produce music in a digital environment by transferring their embodied cognition. The findings reveal that prior musical background impacts efficiency of learning to translate ideas into the interface. Visual cues are the most important form of feedback for novice learners, whereas experts are able to translate their thoughts into the interface without as much input from visual cues, such as relying on their ears when mixing. A fluency akin to embodied cognition can come when one understands the interface as an instrument.&nbsp;},

abstract = {Telemedicine is an alternative healthcare delivery mechanism poised to increase access to healthcare. However, telemedicine has received limited uptake and use by patients. Like other health information technologies (HIT), usability is a critical determinant of telemedicine acceptance and use. Users’ first impression of telemedicine and understanding of the appropriate use of telemedicine stems from their interaction with telemedicine provider websites. Without sufficient telemedicine communications, users will not perceive telemedicine to be a quality healthcare delivery method or understand how to perform a virtual physician visit. Therefore, evaluating the usability of telemedicine provider websites is needed in order to determine how users interact with them and understand the information and instructions provided. This paper describes a mixed-methods usability study involving content analysis, remote usability testing and think aloud usability testing. Combined, these methods offered increasing degrees of validity, reliability, and fidelity, which researchers are constantly evolving for the health and medicine context. The multidimensional usability testing framework described in this paper can be applied in other fields and can be modified for other technologies and contexts.},

abstract = {Part website, part academic article, the “born-digital” webtext opens new opportunities for interactive, multimodal scholarship that breaks free from the constraints of print, digitally accessible publishing. However, webtext designers and publishers lack feedback on the experiences of born-digital readers: diverse users accustomed to online resources for whom webtexts are ostensibly designed. This paper provides such feedback by using comparative findings from webtext usability tests conducted with academic faculty and graduate students to elaborate seven dimensions of user-centered webtext design. The dimensions and associated usability findings— including affordances and constraints that facilitate skimming scanning, and close reading, signifiers and conceptual models that familiarize users with unfamiliar designs, and feedback and mappings that help users contextualize their reading and understand their reading progress— provide scope and guidance for the design of born-digital webtexts readers find both useful and usable.},

abstract = {“Migrants as Place-Makers” investigates the role of technical communicators in determining where place could be made. Most discussions find place in locations that accommodate people through community functions, social interactions, and commercial exchanges; however, not much has been considered in how place is made through necessity. This paper applies place methodology to water stations for migrants left on the US-Mexico border by the organization Humane Borders. Humane Borders locates water barrels based on proximity to border, migrant water consumption, and rates of vandalism of water stations. Overall, migrants can make place at water stations, decreasing the likelihood of water station relocation and increasing the chance of migrant hydration. Two research questions organize this paper: How are technical communicators predicting the best location for a water station? How can technical communicators better predict the next location for a place and lessen the frequency of relocation if a water station does not become a place to migrants? Place and space methodology asks the field to consider migrants as interlocutors between place and technical communicator to better (re)locate water stations and lessen the frequency of relocation. These questions are answered through a case study of two water stations where I find that when migrants recognize a water station as a place, it deters vandalism. Thus, technical communicators should especially promote place-making at frequently vandalized water stations.},

Prior research has generated important findings regarding information needs of developers and expectations they form towards API documentation. Several guidelines have been proposed on the basis of these findings, but evidence is lacking whether such guidelines actually lead to better documentation. This paper contributes the results of an empirical test that compared the performance of two groups of developers working on a set of pre-defined tasks with an API they were unfamiliar with. One group had access to documentation which was optimized following guidelines for API documentation design proposed in the literature whereas the other group used non-optimized documentation. Results show that developers working with optimized documentation made fewer errors on the test tasks and were faster in planning and executing the tasks. We conclude that the guidelines used in our study do have the intended effect and effectively support initial interactions with an API.},

To illustrate, it offers a case study analyzing two iterations of the homepage the Microsoft Partner Network. By cataloguing the differences between the websites and analyzing what specifically has changed, the study suggests that we can extrapolate certain changes in the values that Microsoft as an organization holds.},

Scholars in technical and professional communication have not yet conducted needed empirical research into people's perception and comprehension of data visualizations, especially when part of larger information texts [1]. Our study investigated the extent to which people exaggerated the differences between data points when reading graphs about non-controversial topics that used deceptive techniques and/or exaggerated titles. Participants (n=329) were randomly assigned to view one of four treatments for four different graph types (bar, line, pie, and bubble) and then asked to answer a question about each graph. Results show that deceptive techniques used in the graphs (including truncated axes, 3-D exaggeration, and arbitrary sizing), caused participants to misinterpret information in the deceptive vs. control visualizations for all of the graphs regardless of graph type, previous visualization coursework or comfort level with reading graphs. Results also showed that the presence of exaggerated vs. control titles that accompanied each graph did not significantly influence the extent of the misinterpretation. We will discuss the implication of these findings for technical communication as well as avenues of future research already underway that investigate these topics further.},

This study explores elements of document design that may affect the reading of Japanese web documents by non-native speakers. We conducted an experiment to examine the effect of document structure (hierarchical, networked, and relational) on the reading of administrative documents by native and non-native speakers. The results showed several differences between native and non-native Japanese speakers’ reading patterns and the degree of information acquisition in&nbsp;relation to document structure and design elements.},

How can the ones who have access to engage in epistemological performances through digital archives make these domains a space to deconstruct essentialized identity categories forced upon the Other by the (hetero)patriarchal and/or imperial-colonial Self? And how can participatory design frameworks contribute to that? Triggered by these questions, my critical digital archival research project attempts at finding theories-praxes to make dialogic rooms in digital archives to build a relationship with historically, structurally, and/or systematically minoritized communities and their distinctive, transitory, plural, and conjunctural narratives. This paper introduces my ongoing doctoral project of the critical digital archive where I am documenting and theorizing a digital archive of my street photography in Nepal that I am building through participatory design frameworks with South Asian communities. In this paper, I offer a look at how the complexities and obstacles faced during UX research can enable technical communicators to rupture the essentialist foundation of identity constructions of Non-Western communities. My paper aims to communicate the necessity of conducting UX research through participatory-design frameworks not only to find answers to design technology but to see a way of completely subverting epistemic violence of colonial discourses through the “failure” to find answers.},

abstract = {Networked communication technologies have been deployed in efforts to engage citizens in scientific inquiry through mediated approaches. The use of digital networked technologies in the citizen science space, however, retains the same problems of usability and access that other digital experiences in terms of inclusion. A user experience research orientation to the problem of citizen science inclusivity may prove to be useful to public science projects seeking to engage with citizen-users traditionally marginalized from citizen science projects.This paper contributes to that scholarship by outlining the initial inquiries into the usability of an online citizen science project. First, the paper briefly situates the history of citizen science from a citizen/user perspective. Then the paper reviews the contemporary relationships between user experience and usability in the design of citizen science efforts. Next, the paper grounds that discussion in an experience report of the citizen science project including the project managers goals for inclusive participation. Following that discussion, the presenters ground their discussion in the findings of a usability test developed for a citizen science project, SciStarter, through a graduate course focused on usability for technical communicators. The role of SciStarter.org is to connect potential participants with projects of interest, and as such serves a crucial function to the overall success of SciStarter and the individual projects housed there. To assess how effective, efficient, and satisfying it is to use the SciStarter website, we report on a remote moderated usability test was conducted on the desktop version of the site. The testing took place over several days in October 2019 and featured sessions with five participants. The article concludes by outlining challenges and opportunities for usability and user experience technical communicators to explore issues of inclusive user experience design and the teaching of such as well as contribute to inclusive citizen science efforts.},

We extend this discussion by aligning soft skills with everyday entrepreneurial practices as another route for teaching students social and cultural awareness. We argue this pedagogical shift will help students succeed as communicators to diverse audiences given the demands of today's globally diverse workplace. Cultivating entrepreneurial expertise alongside soft skills can produce students who are more attuned to diversity and inequity, and are able to re-shape workplace contexts to be more socially just.&nbsp;We situate entrepreneurs as everyday rhetoricians to demonstrate opportunities to teach students fruitful ways to foster socially attuned communicative practices, thereby contributing to the development of the students' own professional identities. To this end, we present a case study highlighting everyday entrepreneurship framed by participants whose identities are attuned toward social justice. Next, we apply the entrepreneurial values demonstrated by those cases to teaching re-defined notions of “soft skills,” which are traditionally seen as a nebulous amalgam of generic rhetorical and communicative skills. We conclude with next steps and pedagogical interventions to help cultivate these entrepreneurial skills among TPC students.},

abstract = {This research report will detail how a multi-research university collaborative team, led by the Center for Science Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University (CSTEPS), researched and tested a pilot interface to query science, technology, and innovation experts, and to broadcast this information in a rapidly deployed, interactive, and publicly-accessible way. This interface pilot, called SciOPS, houses a survey tool that queries science, technology, and innovation (STI) experts about issues of contemporary import. SciOPS then parses and distributes the results to the public in order to generate a more informed public discourse about what science, technology, and innovation experts think about pressing current issues in an interesting and statistically-valid way. To date, there isn't a widely-known forum for science, technology, and innovation (STI) professionals to aggregate and broadcast their opinions on a wide range of contemporary issues. Journals and traditional academic scientific outlets are slowly distributed, poorly translated for non-experts, and are only loosely linked to policy or other non-research-specific matter. More popular and widely-available science, technology, and innovation outlets, like Science, are more prone to depict science as a two-sided conversation, with a single representative expert on the one side, and any variation of interlocutor on the other. This popular depiction of the conversation presents distorting zero-sum formulations, and gives a false sense of expert unanimity and certainty. SciOPS was designed, piloted, and tested to see if involving a large team of scientists, technologists, and innovators in contemporary discussions about a range of topics could change the trajectory of how science information is generated and consumed. By designing an interface that emphasizes transparency around survey methods and process, the team aimed to disrupt mainstream genres of scientific public discourse—in particular the cloistered conversations of scientists to one another in specialized familiolects, and the two-sided conversation that pits experts vs. any range of opposed views—and instead creates a space for more nuanced representation of expert consensus or dissensus, the team aimed to present expertise as an evolving, living discourse. This research report will detail how multiple partners–a lab, a university research center, and a design firm–all coordinated work to manifest this scientific discourse in an understandable way.},

abstract = {During the outbreak of COVID-19 in China and the Wuhan lockdown, Chinese-speaking volunteers from across the world offered a genre ecology to provide accurate technical information and useful resources to inform people; to emphasize the lived experiences of those impacted by the virus; and to coordinate online and offline actions to bring resources and support to those impacted by the pandemic directly and indirectly, using social media platforms. Facing barriers of systemic oppression caused by government information control, transnational political tensions, and racial and ethnic discriminations, these civic technical communicators acted as forces of resistance to enact social justice-oriented technical communication. In this article, we propose a social justice-oriented, critically contextualized methodology to analyze such transcultural communications and perform a rhetorical genre analysis of example genres. We argue that these citizen communicators were transparent about their positionality and aware of their privileges when facilitating crisis communication and disaster relief in order to empower those marginalized in the dominant discourse and oppressed by official relief measures. We offer implications on critical practices for researchers, practitioners, and teachers of technical communication for engaging with social justice in transcultural crisis communication.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a relevant topic of interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) since it makes feasible a future computing scenario that can change the way people experiment and use technology. IoT is a new paradigm in which intelligent objects equipped with sensors, networks, and processing technologies integrate and work together to provide smart services to users. In the face of the rapid growth in the number of connected devices in an IoT scenario, the perspective of a smarter world could be actual. However, it is still too far away due to challenges related to human interaction. To help understand the issues involved in building experiences with multiple devices, we conducted interviews with ten companies exploring the characteristics and challenges surrounding the IoT project to designing IoT technologies. The results identified a set of qualitative data from companies that are developing IoT projects allowing us to discuss future directions for research. Our main contribution is related to the identification of important aspects of IoT that impact the design of user-friendly solutions. We conclude pointing to the need for IoT design that takes into account the users' particularities.},

First, I argue that problems in developing and using automated writing algorithms are complex and recurrent wicked problems that can hardly be solved with traditional, once-and-for-all solutions. Then I analyze how wicked problems harm user experience and benefits, causing unequal power distribution between users and tech giants. Finally, I argue that design thinking as “a process for addressing complex, messy problems in the world” [1] can help improve the use of AW technologies to avoid technological exploitation and exclusion of users. Design thinking's emphasis on users’ voices, experiences, and needs can help bring the design and use of AW technologies back to human-centeredness.},

abstract = {The web has provided users with interactivity through Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). However, due to the dynamic nature of RIAs, most applications still do not implement accessible solutions in their components for a variety of reasons, such as the lack of specialized knowledge by developers. Besides, there is a lack of tools capable of performing an automatic evaluation for accessibility in RIAs. To automatically evaluate accessibility in RIAs, tools mainly require the identification of the dynamic components. In this paper, we propose a solution that aims to automatically identify widgets in RIAs, by simulating interactions of a real user with a web application, through all the possible events their elements can receive. The developed mechanism extracts the properties of the dynamic elements to compose a database to guide the classification of specific widgets. We evaluated the potential of the mechanism, by applying it with different implementations of a particular widget, the Calendar. Also, the mechanism was tested in a controlled environment to verify more accurately the changes that occur on a web page, which could precisely identify the widgets as Calendars.},

abstract = {Infrastructure is a crucial consideration for creating code that can be reused and repurposed. Infrastructures of data are highly rhetorical, because they structure how others interact with information and reflect hierarchies of information, people, and things. Those creating open source and open science projects, in particular, must consider how they structure their data according to principles of accessibility, reusability, and replicability. Failure to consider the design of publicly available code and insufficient user documentation lead to issues with transparency, learnability, and usability within open source science projects.This paper explores the decision-making processes of two open science researchers as they design their data according to the principles of open science. Using interviews and document analysis, I analyze the rhetorical coding choices of researchers and how these choices encourage or discourage accessibility for different audiences. Ultimately, I examine what accessibility means for these researchers working under the umbrella of open science.},

These systems record retention data, including high absenteeism, failing grades, disciplinary violations, and low standardized test scores. Many school districts use this data to label students with “mental health problems” and “antisocial behaviors,” though this data may just as likely indicate a lack of privilege. In many cases, students identified by EWS must be threat-assessed by school personnel and law enforcement. By linking retention data with mental health (MH) concerns and the threat of violence so explicitly, identification by an EWS can replicate dominant narratives about individuals with MH concerns. My project illuminates these injustices through analysis of EWS usage in Florida school districts.},

Fifty total respondents between the ages of 21-61+ completed a twelve-question Qualtrics survey; twenty-one participants’ responses were analyzed. Results showed no correlation between participants who used a smartphone and their preference for scheduling an appointment via a mobile application. This assessment suggests additional research is necessary to determine if information design could influence older adults’ preference for scheduling a doctor's appointment using a mHealth app. },
