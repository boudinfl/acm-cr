abstract = {The 2004 SIGDOC conference deals with the "implications of making communication design a systematic process of specification, creation, management, and evolution--in short, an engineering approach." Over the past three years, and more intensely, over the past 12 months or so, the STC board of directors has been using a similar approach to transform the Society for Technical Communication to an organization more responsive to the diverse and changing needs of its diverse and changing members and more able to take advantage of changing technology to meet those needs. The transformation is far from finished and far from concrete in its processes--but we are on the path and after months of members questioning, "why transform," the queries are now of the "how" variety. The presentation by STC immediate past president Thea Teich at the SIGDOC Diana Award luncheon will cover why and how STC is transforming, and why and how it will continue to be even more deserving of this Diana Award when its transformation is complete.},

abstract = {This paper examines how documentation is used to create "quality" engineering processes in software development, focusing on recent industry trends of adopting use case driven software engineering models, to investigate a phenomenon that in this paper I call "genre dumping." The paper aims to address questions about how software development methods change under a use-case driven model. For example, is it really that easy to adopt the use case methodology? The paper draws from a 24-month case study of a small cross-disciplinary team of software designers, developers, testers, and managers who are helping build a large in-house application for a multinational financial services corporation called "Financial Capital" (pseudonym). This project was selected for study because a use case driven model was being applied to explicitly change software engineering practices: use cases were newly adopted and thus unfamiliar to those involved in the software development project.Presented are selected results of qualitative and quantitative analyses of textual and interview data. The findings are interpreted using rhetorical genre theory, which features a large and growing body of workplace research about the ways documents enable (and constrain) people to get work done. The results show that textual features of the documents of the older design methods persist in the newly adopted use cases and that readers' approaches to text-related meaning making also persist, indicating generic recurrence. The findings also show that conflict occurs at the same sites where recurrence occurs. The paper concludes with discussions of implications for technical communicators and genre theorists interested in technical communication.},

abstract = {Coh-Metrix is a web-based application currently in development that automatically evaluates text. It uses two central concepts from discourse processing: text-based cohesion and situation-model based coherence. Cohesion is the degree to which components of the text are linked. Coherence is the representation of the world that the text conveys. Our intention is for Coh-Metrix to eventually map the cohesion of a text to the background knowledge and reading skills of the reader. Coh-Metrix will then be able to give feedback to a writer about which aspects of the text are cohesive and which lack cohesion. This will enable the writer to determine which aspects of the text need to be improved. Applications of Coh-Metrix on document quality as well as other future directions for the development of Coh-Metrix are discussed.},

Specifically, the team chose to cease delivery of their installation documentation in a printed manual format in favor of context-sensitive online help delivered directly in the installation wizard interface. The online help version of the installation instructions meets the users' usability requirements by allowing users to access information directly from the interface itself.},

abstract = {Traditional theories on multimedia design have considered the importance of modality effect to a large extent. The stress on modality effect has often de-emphasized the importance of what information architecture can do to control modality effect if information presentation is self-paced instead of system paced. We have considered a patient education module as our case study. I propose a conversational interactive patient education module as a solution which responds to individual reader needs during hypermedia interaction. In this article, I take an initial step towards this approach, testing patient education modules with and without narration to support text and static graphics. Our results suggest that levels of reader comprehension and accuracy for modules with and without narration have similar performance. Readers have shown a preference towards using narration, online text and graphics based on individual task, if the system permits a self-paced interaction. Thus, we argue that modality effect may be influenced with a self-paced system.},

It is an extension of the Transaction Design Model that is part of the Ubiquitous Web Applications (UWA) framework, a comprehensive framework for designing ubiquitous Web applications. A series of (extended) UML diagrams are used to graphically document the UWAT+ meta-model, which greatly facilitates adoption of the approach by practicing software engineers and technical writers. Use of the approach for documenting Web Transaction designs in both forward and reverse engineering processes is described.},

abstract = {The signal to noise ratio is a common concept in radio communications and electronic communication in general. For a radio, the static is the noise. Too much static and the storm report gets drowned out, or at least you must listen closely to understand the announcer. Unfortunately, information designers do not posses a clear cut set of techniques available to electrical engineers. For information systems, taking the raw data in a system and deciding what is signal and what is noise proves to be extremely difficult. This paper will examine how the concept of signal to noise ratio can be applied to documentation. It will consider how the need to address different tasks and audience forces compromises on the writer to meet those different needs, when each audience has different definitions of which information constitutes signal and which constitutes noise.},

However, unlike image thumbnails, document thumbnails are mainly for the consumption of software such as search engines, and other content processing systems. With the advent of the semantic web, the requirement for machine processing of documents has become extremely important. We give particular attention to electronic documents in XML and in RDF/XML, with a view towards the processing of documents in the semantic web.},

abstract = {Exstatic is a generic static checker developed by the author to address many of the practical problems in program development. Static checking provides a valuable means for automating time consuming checks not only concerned with program correctness (writing the right program), but also to do with style (writing the program right). Previous static checkers have been closely coupled with compilation systems, and therefore tend to be applicable to the code itself and not to all of the textual information (such as makefiles, comments, documentation sources) surrounding the code. The generic nature of Exstatic allows it to overcome these boundaries, and indeed it can be applied to any medium for which there is a formally definable syntax and (to an extent) semantics. Exstatic can therefore be used to increase the productivity and quality of documentation of programs, checking for such things as adherence to house style, consistency with the program being documented and self consistency. This paper describes the design and use of Exstatic, with particular reference to its use in documentation systems.},

This approach is then applied by using a critical analysis of the Bauhaus to inform a possible theory base of content management, relying on the two fields' similar motivations and obstacles, a parallel that is illustrated with an example of reusable learning objects in e-learning.},

Two-thousand-word sections from about 20 articles published at 25-year intervals (1800, 1825, 1850, etc.) for a total of 127 articles were analyzed by a new tool (Coh-metrix) developed by McNamara, Louwerse, and Graesser [9] at the University of Memphis' Institute for Intelligent Systems. The study discerned significant differences in four general measurement areas: word information, connectives, causal cohesion, and syntactic complexity. Specifically, there was a significant decrease in concreteness, imagability, number of causal verbs, number of causal particles, number of connectives (including total number of connectives, and positive temporal and causal connectives), and the mean number of higher-level constituents per sentence and per word. We also found a significant increase in age of acquisition, syntactic complexity (measured in mean number of modifiers per noun phrase), and indicators of analytical and logical difficulty.},

abstract = {Genre theorists agree that genres work together in assemblages. But what is the nature of these assemblages? In this paper I describe four frameworks that have been used to describe assemblages of genres: genre sets, genre systems, genre repertoires, and genre ecologies. At first glance, they seem to be interchangeable, but there are definite and sometimes quite deep differences among them. I compare and contrast these frameworks and suggest when each might be most useful.},

abstract = {This paper provides an updated discussion of the authors' ongoing efforts in developing a design framework for UML diagrams in technical documentation.UML diagrams are a key part of program design. They can enhance understanding of complex programming concepts, and assist in problem analysis and solution design. In a previous paper, "Designing UML diagrams for technical documentation" [1], the authors presented a collaborative process that applies established design principles to UML diagrams, improving diagram presentation and shrinking publication costs and schedules. This paper expands on that work, showing how the established process can now be applied to several different modeling tools, including IBM Rational® XDE and Microsoft Visio. It also provides a detailed description of how to export modeling files to other file formats. The authors show how their process workflow has evolved over the past year as it has been applied by developers, writers, and graphic designers at IBM's Toronto Software Laboratory, and discuss ways in which they will continue to monitor and improve the efficacy of both the process and resulting diagrams.},

abstract = {A sequence diagram shows a series of events that occurs within a particular system. A sequence diagram can be extremely useful for design and analysis, since it shows logic flow visually. However, because even a simple programming sequence can stretch far beyond the confines of a single screen or printed page, authors of technical material must be able to identify and apply a set of best practices. The set of practices developed for the IBM Toronto Software Laboratory enables authors to reasonably present such diagrams within the limited confines of the publishing medium. Building on the work presented in the article "Designing UML diagrams for technical documentation" [1], this paper discusses an approach for dealing with the particular challenges of presenting sequence diagrams in technical documentation.},

abstract = {This paper addresses how intellectual property affects the Web in general, and content publishing on the Web in particular. Before its commercialization, the Web was perceived as being free and unregulated; this assumption is no longer true. Nowadays, content providers need to know which practices on the Web can result in potential legal problems. The vast majority of Web sites are developed by individual such as technical writers or graphic artists, and small organizations, which receive limited or no legal advice. As a result, these Web sites are developed with little or no regard to the legal constraints of intellectual property law. In order to help this group of people, the paper tries to answer the following question: What are the (typical) legal issues for Web content providers to watch out for? This paper gives an overview of these legal issues for intellectual property (i.e., copyrights, patents, and trademarks) and discusses relevant law cases. As a first step towards a more formal risk assessment of intellectual property issues, we introduce a maturity model that captures a Web site's intellectual property coverage with five different maturity levels.},
