We demonstrate how the pedagogical and theoretical takeaways from this research have been translated into personas, conceptual models, and interactive mockups for PromptMe--- a web application that prompts data-driven conversations between instructors and students regarding expectations in assignment sheets. At SIGDOC, we will share our designs, discuss how we see pedagogy reflected in Prompt Me, and highlight the value of designing technologies as a learning strategy. This conversation will spark ideas for enacting democratic teaching through interaction design.},

Proposal writing literature, however, tends toward content and text-based analysis and production with little emphasis on visual communication. With this opportunity, this study investigates visual usage in nineteen successful National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) proposals to codify visual practices, describe current uses, and recognize opportunities to better integrate visual communication into this high-stakes genre. Results show that proposal writers in the humanities field seem to use text manipulations frequently and effectively, though there also seems to be little consistency concerning the actual form of typographical manipulations for specific purposes. Further, usage of graphical visuals appears to be an underrepresented aspect of proposal writing both in frequency of incorporating visuals and also diversity and complexity of visuals when they are incorporated in proposals.},

We reviewed grades given by self and peers on video presentations, as well as grades given by instructors and markers in similar in-class presentations, then asked students questions on the effectiveness (n-115). The preliminary findings indicate that students gained confidence from using the video platform, which correlated with improved public speaking skills. We also found, in the first of three tracked assignments, a correlation between the grades given by peers (on video) and the grades given by instructors (in-class) indicating the students' ability to assess themselves and their peers in a manner similar to the instructors'. We conclude that public speaking can be taught without the public.},

For the past twenty years, academics and practitioners of participant-based research have worked to integrate practices and methods to improve the user experience of products and services. While it is clear that industry is seeing value in participant-centered research, there are difficulties in putting it into practice. Building upon prior research on methods with a firm foundation in technical communication and our experiences working on product teams, we argue that recognizing similarities of method across disparate schools of thought is one way to lead as experience architects. The goal of this work is to propose that we think and act in more strategic ways about participant-centered research as we work with product marketing and service development across our organizations. By reconsidering this work and our roles, we can work across organizations to guide and lead research that can benefit the organization as user experience architects, much in the same way that content strategists have met with success.},

Because UX research is designed to maximize insights into user motivation, part of UX ethical concerns should include how insights get integrated into the communities where the technology is deployed. This report discusses successes and challenges of drawing conclusions from qualitative research in an annual art event. In the Fargo-Moorhead Art Marathon, content creators collected user data, collaboratively strategized with participants, and refined a three-year-old event that has grown from a loose assortment of performances into a ten-day multi-mediated art event created for alternative art engagement. The authors, who conducted initial research to create a phone app to track the participant progress, report on how event data during was evaluated and folded into the next iteration.},

abstract = {This paper describes the experience of experimental artwork "Universal Scent Blackbox", which encourages visitors interaction through creating olfactory experience in art museum. Smell is used as the evocative interface between the artwork and the visitors. When a visitor passed by a certain area, it would trigger the odor emission in another area for the other visitors. The visitors on another side could trigger the odor emission back as well. Throughout the experience, visitors can freely explore the scents around the area of the artwork. In addition, the visitors can express their memories of smell through writing onto origami boxes which contribute as a part of the city model of the artwork. The artwork consisted of all the visitors' memories expression and communication at the end of exhibition. The aim of this paper is neither technology investigation nor user experience evaluation. Instead it is an open-end exploration which questions the role of olfactory interface in art museum context and provokes the insights about olfactory interaction design in Human-Computer Interaction. The artwork becomes the inspirational probe to explore the possibilities of olfactory interface with the users when designing for communication. The benefits and drawbacks of the chosen approach towards olfactory interaction design would be discussed. I would also address the lessons learned behind throughout the process.},

The objective is to find out how participants in this milieu take on, understand and portray persona artefacts, what goals of User Experience (UX) emerge from the inquiry, and whether the artefacts created simulate or differ from those in literature. Tentative methods scaffold from benefits attained by persona in the attempt to advance persona technical communication in cross-cultural design. This experience report presents initial findings on narrative content, rhetorical preferences, and the physical layout of persona artefacts as so-far constructed by Otjiherero speakers in rural Namibia.

Technical communication faculty members should provide strong examples of effective user experiences and should be leaders in making the interfaces of online learning management systems as usable as possible.Principles of usability designed for general web sites may or may not apply to learning management systems designed for educational purposes. In order to create effective online technical communication courses, one needs to consider both usability concerns and pedagogical concerns.To assess the usability and pedagogical effectiveness of online courses, faculty members may use indirect means such as heuristic analyses. In addition, they may use direct means such as usability testing, student feedback, and analytic tools. Each approach has advantages as well as limitations. Faculty members will gain the richest information through using multiple approaches.In assessing usability and pedagogical effectiveness, faculty members also need to consider the situational constraints and resources in their unique contexts. Understanding and adapting their approaches to use resources well and to work within constraints will benefit their abilities to enhance their student users' experiences with online courses.},

abstract = {In a recent issue of CDQ, Aparicio and Costa (2014) present a discussion of the long history of data visualization, articulating that data visualization is, again, gaining in popularity and attention. Included in this discussion of data visualization is a subset of data visualization--infographics. Such inclusion is apt, considering that Blythe, Lauer, and Curran (2014) found that infographics are one of the top 10 genres in which alumni of technical communication programs reported that they generate on the job site and within their own lives.With regard to the importance of and renewed interest in data visualization (and by extension infographics), in this article I call attention to a specific use of the infographic---as a form of data visualization from health-related organizations of medical and statistical data regarding obesity. Through analysis of obesity infographics, I argue that infographics about medical data can (and do) feminize the "obese" body and claims the female body as an efficient instrument of normalization and cultural management.To do so, I rhetorically analyze obesity infographics to illustrate that the infographic genre's goals---to simplify, clarify, and deliver complex information in a visually compelling manner---can exercise problematic commitments to expediency and illustrate problematic notions of exigence [Katz, 1992; Ward, 2010; Dragga &amp; Voss 2001]. Such commitments, encourage misreadings of medical data and, by extension, the infographics that convey data regarding body categorizations and notions of health.By obfuscating how infographics potentially drive simplification of terms that reify the narrow frames with which we understand "obesity" and "obese" bodies, I argue that such visual representations of data can also serve a metonymic function for ever-narrowing cultural conceptualizations of obesity-as-detriment and obesity-as-bodily-fault. Further, I argue that such problematic use infographics can reduce the complexities of the body and definitions of the body, especially of the "obese" body and definitions of "obesity," with the effect of potentially pathologizing, managing and normalizing information and bodies under the guise of promoting "health" and "healthy living." Interfacing with medical data in this way, in other words, can be both understandable and yet highly problematic; this article illustrates how and why.},

Nelson et al identify a two-stage process for health communication: an awareness stage which pushes messages for an audience to contemplate often via television and social media, and a pull phase where the audience pulls health information from mediated sources such as a website. A consubstantial site has effective navigation, design and content. The American Medical Association's guidelines for health information (HI) sites urges the inclusion of a robust search engine, FAQs, a site map and accessibility statement and text accessible to a wide audience (i.e. sixth grade reading level) which when adopted further consubstantiality. From a semiotics perspective, the modality and salience of photographs that accompany text on an HI site are also vital to enhance inclusivity and consubstantiality, as is promotional graphics such as the logo. Information designers need to resist branding demands which often sacrifice above-the-fold space to photographs without high information value. In this instance, without culturally relevant photographs and images, the HI site remains stuck in a push phase with HI seekers being contemplators of rather than actors in their own heart health. By practicing consubstantiality, information designers can help HI seekers become engaged actors.},

abstract = {Contexts, tools, and other nonhuman factors are central to the practice and scholarship of technical communication, particularly communication design. But viewed through the lens of posthumanism, these considerations shift from factors to actors: the hierarchy between humans and nonhumans flattens, and the agency of nonhuman actors and assemblages of actors can be explicitly recognized and accounted for. Planning for the agentive capacities of human and nonhuman actors is a strategy with particular promise for work in social justice. This paper demonstrates how posthumanism can contribute to social justice research in technical communication: presenting two strengths of posthumanism for informing this work and two concerns which may threaten the goals of social justice. Illustrating these points, we present data from a study of transit-dependent bus riders' experiences, demonstrating how posthumanism expands considerations for design. We conclude with three implications to guide scholars in viewing social justice issues through lenses of posthumanism.},

In order to attract a broad base of users and acceptance of system enhancements, interface designs are typically highly conventional, building on best practices in HCI. In such systems, the needs of advanced users are often secondary. To probe how the design of tools should be adjusted to the needs of advanced users, we created CrediVis, a tool for visualizing multi-dimensional user data in Wikipedia. Through a two-round study of advanced users, we find that such users value specialized and complex tools designed to fit their needs. We further observed that although they value such advanced tools they prefer conventional rather than novel interface design. Our study suggests that tool design for advanced users must be closely aligned with needs that can be co-discovered with advanced users.},

abstract = {This study describes the results of two structural equation models tested within the nonprofit industry. Prior research requested that researchers assess complexity of proposal development, including collaborative and computer-based authoring. Complex interactions are difficult to directly measure, but factor analysis can account for latent variables.The study uses structural equation modeling to measure contributors to proposal writers' "Job satisfaction" and "Likeliness to contribute to knowledge management system." The researcher used a 126-item survey to collect 580 responses from members of professional organizations for fundraisers. Five significant pathways explained 25.6% of variance in "Job satisfaction": "Interpersonal trust," "Role in organization," "Learning via books/articles," "Relationship with management," and "Organizational processes." Three factors' pathways accounted for 21.1% of variance within "Likeliness to contribute to KM.": "Relationship with management," "Knowledge acquisition habits," and "Role in organization."This work contributes to a preliminary understanding of how communication processes contribute to the proposal writing process.},

abstract = {This paper examines the potential of User-Generated Content (UGC) as a site of research for web usability. Specifically, this paper shares a case study of blog responses that detailed user experiences with the 2013 launch of MNsure.org, a high-stakes website created to facilitate the online purchase of health insurance in response to the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). A content analysis of blog responses, informed by qualitative content analysis [1], revealed poor usability of the site, including a low effectiveness rate, several critical errors, and low satisfaction. User stories were remarkably detailed, offering valuable information for website repairs. Connections between UGC and traditional web usability methods such as usability testing were explored in terms of "community," "participation," and "metrics." Overall, the case demonstrated the potential value of UGC content analysis as a complement to traditional usability testing.},

Originally used in Chemistry to represent the primary molecules and reactions under investigation, graphical abstracts have spread to other science and engineering fields, and in the process have evolved significantly, adapting for different disciplines and contexts. In this paper, we describe the emergence and current ecology of graphical abstracts, and develop a multi-layer taxonomy for analyzing how graphical abstracts function visually and rhetorically, in relation to the rest of their associated article, and to their mediated context. Using this taxonomy, we begin to suggest ways for authors, editors, and publishers to align the functions more productively.},

abstract = {Unigrid" design specifications created by Massimo Vignelli have provided the standards for the layout of paper brochures at U.S. National Park Service sites for more than three decades. These brochures offer visitors a familiar analog presentation of visual information, blending text, photographs, maps, and illustrations. These materials, however, are not accessible to people who are blind, have low vision, or a print disability. The National Park Service for decades has been challenged -- by requirements and principle -- to offer alternate formats that provide equivalent experiences and information of these print materials. In other words, people who are blind or visually impaired should have access to a "brochure" experience, too. This exploratory study, funded by the National Park Service, takes a new approach to this long-term problem by conducting a content analysis of current Unigrid brochures to determine their fundamental components, found in practice. This components-based approach is intended to provide clear pathways for cross-modal translation of the printed material into audio-described media, which then, can be efficiently distributed via mobile apps, as an extension of these original components.},

This paper looks at one genre of social documentation---the crowdsourced documentation wiki---and explores how author support guides on these wikis are constructed. Ultimately, the paper argues that author support guides can be reconceptualized as documentation, and consequently that documentation design theories can be used to improve the construction of these guides. The paper concludes by showing how minimalist documentation design theory can improve the way we support amateur authors on these wikis.},

abstract = {Sustainable intermodal transportation is a promising approach to counter increasing CO2 emissions and mobility restrictions in big cities. However, the broad range of travel services hinders users in planning, booking, and processing trips. Such problems can be addressed by offering self-services as mobile applications. Designers of traveler information apps (TIA) must consider which activities travelers need to perform during all phases of an intermodal trip (travel chain) and provide adequate support. To date, the scientific literature lacks models of intermodal travel chains.In this paper, the need for support in each phase of an intermodal trip is examined: Intermodal chains are modeled with a literature-based and a scenario-based approach; phases, steps, activities, and required support are identified and compared to unimodal travel chains. Implications for the design of a TIA are discussed.},

In the context of a British-Kenyan project, we introduce an approach for addressing sociotechnical gaps in the design and deployment of digital resources in resource-constrained and culturally different environments. We illustrate how despite having an online, asynchronous tool to visualise sociotechnical gaps among different stakeholders in a design team, we had to complement it with a pen and paper design metaphor elucidation exercise to elicit and visualise locally meaningful user interface elements.},

Companies have a duty of responsibility to their customers when hackers steal customer information. This responsibility includes how they communicate the extent and severity of the breach, how it affects individual customers, and what customers need to do to protect themselves. I approach this case from the multi-disciplinary field of technical communication to demonstrate why certain principles from technical communication are preferred to communicate this important information to customers. Using a heuristic approach combined with methods of rhetorical analysis, this article analyzes a data breach notification to evaluate the rhetorical effectiveness of the notification from the user-centered design perspective.},

abstract = {Technology innovators must pitch their technology and its business value to potential buyers, partners, and distributors: to make claims that will create interest in the appropriate audiences and offer evidence that those audiences recognize as credible and applicable. Such pitches typically involve a spoken presentation and a slide deck, both of which must persuade stakeholders. The pitch represents a rhetorically complex argument backed by many interconnected genres.We examine how innovators in an entrepreneurship development program, structured as a competition, developed pitches in response to feedback. We examine pitch changes in terms of overall structure, individual claims and evidence, and engagement tactics. Our findings suggest that presenters found this task of adjusting their pitches to be difficult, partly because the training program's current feedback does not separate out these different aspects. We recommend developing a heuristic to better structure arguments.},

The focus is on deliberate practice as it relates to information design and writing within interactive environments. Deliberate practice is deconstructed into its required components with connections established between these components, badges, and best practices in the literature. Relevant theories are discussed and examples are used to demonstrate strategies for implementing badging systems for deliberate practice within technical and professional environments. The takeaway from this paper is that digital badging systems present opportunities to foster deliberate practice. This practice can then improve a variety of skills and abilities within complex environments, both for improving design and better training end users. Our paper synthesizes findings from the literature to suggest a number of best practices for designing opportunities for useful deliberate practice using digital badges.},
