abstract = {Process models are composed of graphical elements and words. However, words used to name elements during process design have potentially ambiguous meanings, which might result in quality problems. We believe that ontologies might serve as a means to address this problem. This paper discusses aspects related to words used to represent concepts in labels and why ontologies can improve this representation. Also, we analyze how the requirements specifications can influence the terms used during modeling. The discussion regarding ontologies is conceptual. We performed an experiment to analyze empirically the vocabulary problem in the context of process models. In the experiment the selection of terms represented with different levels of explicitness in requirements specifications is evaluated. Our findings suggest that the vocabulary problem occurs in process models. Also, different levels of explicitness affect the labels but are not sufficient to solve the vocabulary problem.},

The paper discusses the increasing penetration of mobile phones and the key considerations of use of mobile banking. The paper proposes an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) based mobile banking model in the cloud suitable for a developing country like India. The World Development Indicators show increasing penetration of mobile phones in both the developed and the developing world. This model can perform the basic formal banking operations with less dependence on external agents or business correspondents. The model assumes the availability of Internet facility in the mobile phones. IVR based models in the cloud are very rare. Most of the existing models use mobile Short Messaging Service (SMS).},

In this paper, I provide a methodological framework for analyzing Twitter conversations during academic conferences. An analysis of tweets archived during the 2014 Conference on College Composition and Communication is included as an example. Tweets using the #4C14 hashtag (N=12,522) were analyzed to determine 1) when people tweet during conferences, 2) what sessions they tweet about most, 3) how often participants tweet during sessions, and 4) what people tweet about at conferences during times of high Twitter activity. Results suggest conference attendees tweet most frequently during the middle of each day during the conference, presentations related to technology yield high Twitter activity, and retweeting particular sessions extended presentations far beyond the designated time blocks of each conference panel. These results provide valuable information for conference organizers and experience architects interested in promoting participatory digital spaces during academic conferences.},

The researcher uses survey data (n = 448) to assess where organizations fall within JoAnn Hackos's Information Process Maturity Model (IPMM) [1]. The paper asks, how do proposal writers perceive current documentation efforts within their organizations? Is there a relationship between an organization's annual operating budget and employees' satisfaction with documentation efforts? Results indicate that most nonprofit organizations fall within the Ad hoc or Rudimentary stage of the IPMM. However, this classification may be due to grant writers' preferences to create individual rather than organizational documentation systems. Organizational documentation practices have both short- and long-term economic implications for the nonprofit industry, particularly fundraising, where employee turnover is a problem.},

Using quality metrics derived from previous work, we perform a usability expert review on a sample of Photoshop tutorials, a popular image-manipulation program with one of the largest showings of web-based tutorials. We also explore how the characteristics of these tutorials differ across four tutorial sources, representing those that are, i) written by a close-knit online community; ii) written by expert users; iii) most likely to be found; and iv) representative of the general population of tutorials. Our analysis reveals that expert users generally write higher quality tutorials, and that many of the tutorials in our sample suffer from some important limitations, such as lacking attempts to help users avoid common errors. We also find that a single five-star rating system did not sufficiently distinguish quality between the tutorials. Building on this later finding, we propose and evaluate a rating approach based on multiple criteria, finding strong initial support for such an approach.},

We argue for a more expansive and symmetrical perspective on communication design---one that broadens the scope of potential actors that affect user experiences, and that more strongly considers their effects on communicative activities. We posit three ways in which this perspective may be operationalized: (a) accounting for the missing masses, (b) designing for flat ontologies and radical symmetry, and (c) designing for interagentivity. Finally, we offer an initial heuristic for deploying such approaches and discuss scenarios in which they may prove fruitful.},

If we are aware of these assumptions, what practices can technical communicators engage in to promote social justice in these contexts?". In the specific instance of home pregnancy test packaging and instructions, the lack of attention to social justice concerns is evidenced when comparing this system-centered technical communication to user-centered online health forums wherein users discuss their lived experiences with the tests, expressing frustration to outright fear. Here, a case study of three brands of home pregnancy tests' packaging offers findings that the technical communication of home pregnancy tests violates an ethic of care to the user. This article proposes that the health and medical communication be brought into alignment with the user-centered, participatory models of online health forums in order to promote social justice in the context of the home pregnancy test.},

Organizational communication worked to simultaneously promote women's industrial independence while tying women to the larger organization by promoting identities for participating women. These forms of communication ultimately united and disciplined the women of the organization, allowing them to share religious best practices, domestic techniques, and community values with one another. There is much work to be done on the history of professional communication in archives, including how it has been used to design religious organizations.},

We translated this artistic expression into digital art installation within a socially 'abandoned' space at a workplace. The biggest challenge is to understand how people interact with the dynamic art-system, that, potentially, it leads audience to experience a highly intimate relationship with the installation and the space. Preliminary results reveal a similar behavior in the audience at both installations, which highlights the potential of ICT to translate the essence of an artistic expression and promote the adoption of a space.},

abstract = {This interactive poster serves to showcase the evolving roles Institutional Review Boards (IRB) have in research on texts, both physical and digital. Over time, the awareness of and adherence to IRB has grown in technical and professional communication research and scholarship. Part of this growth can be attributed to need (research is more and more being conducted in places such as hospitals, where privacy is vital). However, recent cases, such as the PANS article regarding Facebook and emotion manipulation, indicate that the user experience (UX) of certain products call traditional IRB policies in to question. In particular, questions about text production, dissemination, and subsequent research on texts indicate that IRB policies have not evolved to meet the demands of present research culture. This poster suggests that the narratives and extensions of IRBs preclude and exclude serious consideration of texts by their very design and representation to researchers. This poster examines how IRBs communicate policies to technical and professional communication researchers, and, in light of new research methodologies, researchers can develop extensions to IRB protocol internal to the field. In doing so, this poster aims to ensure ethical treatment of human subjects both as participants, and as authors of texts, in research.},

abstract = {Throughout the world, every day people are participating in sanctioned and unsanctioned memory making activities in public spaces. Due to their ever-changing status, sites of public memory are difficult to capture and archive. This poster brief focuses on determining methods for successfully recording the changes in these spaces using various digital platforms. By exploring and testing these platforms, we hope to discover which space offers the best way to discuss and record a site. The findings of this research will offer insight on how best to capture and discuss spaces that undergo frequent change.},

abstract = {This poster brief describes ongoing research on user taxonomies in free internet pornography, examining tagging and filtering systems in two digital porn bulletin boards on the social network Reddit. These two communities---r/PornVids, a board for mainstream porn, and r/ChickFlixxx, a board for woman-friendly or feminist porn---offer unique insight into not only porn consumption patterns, but also ways of sorting pornography according to distinctly gendered preferences. The researcher concludes by describing future directions for empirical inquiry into internet pornography, making a case for the importance of affective considerations in user research and interface design.},

abstract = {In this poster presentation, the author presents results of a study about student journalist perceptions of the wearable technology Google Glass (Glass). This poster presents the first set of results of an ongoing research project designed to determine what factors play the largest roles in student decision making processes about whether or not to use a new technology. Survey results of students in a semester-long capstone journalism course are presented. Results indicate that students' perceptions of social norms related to the new technology shaped early use of the wearable device. After becoming more familiar with Glass and using the device in training sessions, student social norm apprehensions did not decrease. This printed poster will include video footage related to the project through augmented reality technology accessible via smartphones.},

abstract = {This interactive poster explores the application of the 12 cognitive dimensions of API usability to API documentation planning by using the dimensions to identify and characterize the factors that influence the documentation that the users of an API require. Many factors can complicate estimating and planning the documentation an API requires. Even when an API's documentation requirements can be estimated, it can be difficult to present to stakeholders an objective basis for the estimate. The cognitive dimensions of API usability have characterized APIs and their users successfully and they have been used to communicate these characterizations to stakeholders. It follows that the same dimensions could also help identify the documentation that an API requires to provide a satisfactory and successful experience for the software developers who use the API.},
