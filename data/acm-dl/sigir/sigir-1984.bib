abstract = {This paper compares two different approaches for indexing archived text documents. The first approach is based on inversion of words in the text, the second on the generation of a signature file representing the text content. A system reflecting the word inversion approach is compared against two systems reflecting the signature scanning approach and using, alternatively, superimposed coding and the concatenation of word signatures. Performances are estimated using analytical models of these systems. Characteristics are evaluated in function of office environment requirements. The evaluations derive from a model for estimating the statistical parameters of text archives.This work has been partially developed as part of the EEC ESPRIT project on "Mixed-Mode Message Filing System" in the Office Systems area.},

A view is specified only in terms of a set of dataitems and the mappings required to materialize the data are automatically generated as the result of this conversation. The form becomes then the basis for accessing the database. Queries are submmited by specifying selection conditions on the fields of a form. Selected occurrences are retrieved from the database and may be scanned as conventional paper forms.},

Therefore, the idea of generating a sequence of DBMS transactions for a single IRS transaction is discussed. This notion of "nested" transactions assumes standard concurrency control technology but is applied twice: in the underlaying DBMS layer and in the IRS layer. The consequence is that multi-user control and recovery is also necessary in the IRS layer but it utilizes the concurrency control and recovery function of the DBMS.},

This paper examines an extension of the relational model, called a semantic model, as a schema for bibliographic systems. An alternative notation is suggested for the semantic model, based on the Warnier/Orr diagram. An experimental semantic model user interface, which has been developed for an experimental microcomputer information retrieval system, is briefly described.},

Their term usage may therefore provide the necessary statistics for parameter estimation to test both theories.},

address = {Swindon, GBR},
abstract = {Transaction log analysis represents a powerful methodology which allows examination of both user commands and system responses when conducting an online information search. Machine-readable transaction log tapes from online catalogs are obtained and subsequently analyzed using stochastic pattern developments within parsed user sessions, mathematical models utilizing Markov chain analysis and the development of state transition probability matrices, which illustrate the probability of proceeding from one user or system state to another state. The objective of monitoring information systems and using transaction log analysis is to discover the extent to which systems are used and to determine the actual user patterns when conducting an information search. This in turn can aid in the evaluation of such systems and assist in the improvement of existing and future systems. Such analysis can assist in system design, while the predictive power of the methodology may allow real-time aids to be developed.As examples of the use of the methodology, patron use and system response patterns from several online public catalogs have been obtained by transaction log tapes. This paper presents an overview of the methodology, results obtained, and efforts that are being conducted within OCLC's Office of Research.},

The problem is to determine if the thesaurus must be integrated within the knowledge base.In fact this choice is an architecture problem of the ES. We analyze, in parallel, the effects of this choice about thesaurus representation, ES functionnalities, ES architecture.The choice of an architecture depends on the goal searched: ie a general IR expert system able to handle a set of thesauri (independent thesaurus) or a specialized IR expert system which can be very performant but strongly tied to a specific area (integrated thesaurus).},

Subsequently, it provides an informal description of the two kinds of high level inference operation, relying on information in the rule base, that are implemented in the system : these are known as "transformations" and "hypotheses".

The paper then considers the practical problems of trying to implement such a system. Attention is focussed on the use of current and developing information technology to fulfill both information retrieval and educational objectives. It is shown that current systems as exemplified by PRESTEL, DIALOG, BROWSE and STAF individually will not fulfill the requirements of this system. However, in combination these types of systems should be quite suitable. Another solution is the use of an expert system.

Experienced searchers generally truncate terms at root morpheme boundaries. When searchers do not truncate at root boundaries, the deviations are small.2. Small deviations from root boundaries do not significantly affect retrieval performance.3. There is no significant performance difference between automatic conflation and manual conflation carried out by experienced searchers.4. Based on 3, term conflation can be automated in a retrieval system with no average loss of performance, thus allowing easier and user access to the system.A retrieval system incorporating the information in 4 is described, and shown to be feasible.},

abstract = {The automatic indexing system AIR/PHYS and its evaluation by means of a retrieval test with 309 requests and 15,000 documents is described. First, the underlying conception of a rule based approach is given which is suited to the task of a controlled-vocabulary indexing of even large subject fields. Preconditions, performance and results of the retrieval test are described, including first results of retrieval runs with weighted automatic indexing.},

abstract = {The automatic extraction of words from texts to form the input for information retrieval systems based on inverted files is partly considered on a theoretical basis, and partly in relation to experience gained from developing what has become an operational system. This system was developed to operate on abstracted texts, but is being modified to handle more extended texts either for input into an inverted file or as a stage in creating pre-coordinate indexes. The system is capable of handling compound words, homographs, and synonyms and identifying particular forms of text (such as authors) on the basis of what are termed semantic markers.},

abstract = {The formal modeling of information storage and retrieval systems has been an important element in the analysis and design of these systems. The retrieval mechanism has been viewed as a probablistic decision problem, often involving utilities. One key element is the evaluation of such retrieval systems. In this paper, we focus on the impact of the stopping rule, which determines when the user chooses to stop scanning the list of records retrieved in response to a given query. We shall first trace the evolution of the modelling and use of the stopping rule approach. Then, we shall briefly report on some recent results in our attempt to better model the generation of stopping rules.},
