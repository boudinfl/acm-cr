abstract = {Substantial successes were achieved in the early years in automatic indexing and retrieval using single term indexing theories with term weight assignments based on frequency considerations. The development of more refined indexing systems using thesaurus aids and automatically constructed term association maps changed the retrieval effectiveness only slightly. The recent introduction of the relevance concept in the form of probabilistic retrieval models provided a firm basis for term weighting and document ranking practices. However, the probabilistic methods were not helpful in substantially enhancing the retrieval effectiveness.At the present time, attempts are made to add artificial intelligence concepts to the document retrieval environment in the form of fancy graphics interfaces, learning systems for query and document indexing and for collection searching, extended logic models relating documents and information requests, and analysis methods based on the use of semantic maps and other kinds of knowledge structures. Using the earlier developments and evaluation results as guidelines, an attempt is made to outline the information retrieval environment of the future and to assess the usefulness of some of the currently proposed search and retrieval methods.},

The classification and retrieval strategy specification is based on 53 real problem statements, 35 of which have a total of 250 evaluated documents. Four facets of the ASK structures have been tentatively identified, whose combinations determine the method and order of application of five basic ranking strategies.

abstract = {This paper deal with the necessity of consideration of organizational and user requirements to create the basis for the successful design of future office information servers.Today volumes of the order of 10.000 to 50.000 multimode documents and 1 to 10 million documents at a company level (companies with over 1000 employees) per system have to be archived. The average amount of filing is 12 to 16 running metres of paper per year, with an increasing tendency (Ben84).However the shortcoming of systems of today is not the incapability of storage of big amounts of information but the fact they only support particular (and well structured) office tasks in an operative way. Future systems have to support all kind of work (procedures) people do in an office, consider the strategic and operative goals of the particular office and take the user behaviours especially their knowledge to solve problems and the individual kind of doing their jobs (e.g. search strategies, reminder functions) into account.Analysis methods for the collection of data for the design of office systems have mostly been developed in the context of office automation to develop systems to support particular tasks, to restructure offices to improve the profitability of the company. Because of that fact, these methods must be quite extended to supply data which are suited for the successful design and development of future office information servers.Focal topics of the analysis from an office system perspective are: information generation and location, consistency and permanence, work support, information handling and manipulation, access right and confidentiality, accountability, information flow and use of abstractions. Detailed dimensions concerning these areas are posted in this paper.},

abstract = {The signature approach is an access method for partial-match retrieval which meets many requirements of an office environment. Signatures are hash coded binary words derived from objects stored in the data base. They serve as a filter for retrieval in order to discard a large number of nonqualifying objects. In an indexed signature method the signatures of objects stored on a single page are used to form a signature for that page. In this paper we describe a new technique of indexed signatures which combines the dynamic balancing of B-trees with the signature approach. The main problem of appropriate splitting is solved in a heuristic way. Operations are described and a simple performance analysis is given. The analysis and some experimental results indicate a considerable performance gain. Moreover, the new S-tree approach supports a clustering on a signature basis. Further remarks on adaptability complete this work.},

abstract = {The “concordance” of an information retrieval system can often be stored in form of bit-maps, which are usually very sparse and should be compressed. Hierarchical bit-vector compression consists of partitioning a vector vi into equi-sized blocks, constructing a new bit-vector vi+1 which points to the non-zero blocks in vi, dropping the zero-blocks of vi, and repeating the process for vi+1. We refine the method by pruning some of the tree branches if they ultimately point to very few documents; these document numbers are then added to an appended list which is compressed by the prefix-omission technique. The new method was thoroughly tested on the bit-maps of the Responsa Retrieval Project, and gave a relative improvement of about 40% over the conventional hierarchical compression method.},

abstract = {In the compression of the text files, the dependencies between the successive characters should be exploited to as great an extent as possible. There are two obvious possibilities: either to detect and encode often occurring character strings, or to encode successors of character blocks. This paper presents two methods based on the latter approach. In the first method we encode only the most probable successors of blocks, whereas in the second we encode them all, using the knowledge of their distribution. The second method uses recursion to store effectively the dependencies between the characters and this results in good compression gains in practical cases.},

Investigating this topic has led us to the definition of a retrieval strategy which incorporates parsing of query text and a more “shallow” parsing of document texts, whose retrieval effectiveness is investigated and described. Our results indicate that significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness can be obtained by incorporating such linguistic processing into an overall retrieval strategy.},

abstract = {In the framework of an application dealing with classified advertisement matching, a dedicated user interface has been designed and implemented. Its major originality relies on the user's language which is neither an artificial one, nor the usual natural language, but in fact the ad language. Beyond the language itself, the interface provides some facilities such as paraphrasing or explanations when needed. An expert system approach has been adopted and the interface is built up from the knowledge given by experts. They are in charge of describing what are acceptable ads, from both syntax and semantics points of view … Although designed in the context of ad matching, that interface may interestingly be adapted to other retrieving systems. We especially think that an adlike language is well-suited to ask questions since it is based on natural simple expressions. A given sentence involves terms that stand for elementary conditions applying to instances of a logical object contained inside the information system. This approach defines a complete interface, involving both a language and aiding capabilities. Moreover, the query language, although less powerful, represents a compromise between artificial languages and the usual natural language, with respect to ergonomics and analysis complexity.},

The text processing is done on a main frame computer, the results are transferred to a minicomputer where the evaluation is performed. REALIST is a stand alone package, fitting any existing search systems.In the retrieval context, this technique reduces connecting time and improves the search results.REALIST is able to run on English and German texts. Each REALIST component has been separately tested with good success. An integrated version is currently under test at the US Patent ad Trademark Office using 150000 English patent abstracts, and a German version is being tested with 12000 legal texts of the European Community.},

Since the clusters obtained by this scheme are not characterized in terms of the document representations, a strategy for cluster searching is also developed.

It is shown that this unified model, unlike currently available alternatives, has the advantage of incorporating term correlations into the retrieval process. The query language extension is attractive in the sense that most of the algebraic properties of the strict Boolean language are still preserved. Although the experimental results for extended Boolean retrieval are not always better than the vector processing method, the developments here are significant in facilitating commercially available retrieval systems to benefit from the vector based methods. The proposed scheme is compared to the p-norm model advanced by Salton and coworkers. An important conclusion is that it is desirable to investigate further extensions that can offer the benefits of both proposals.},

This paper summarizes a set of experiments with different methods of term weighting for documents, using measures of term importance within an entire document collection, term importance within a given document, and document length. It is shown that significant improvements over no term weighting can be made using a combination of weighting measures and normalizing for document length.},

abstract = {The introduction of domain knowledge into a document retrieval system has two important consequences; an increase in the effectiveness of retrieval and a decrease in the efficiency of text processing. In this paper, a method is presented of combining user-specified domain knowledge with efficient retrieval techniques based on probabilistic models. The domain knowledge is represented as a collection of frames that contain rules specifying recognition conditions for domain concepts and relationships between concepts. The inference network represented in these frames is used to infer the concepts that are related to a user's query. This approach is being implemented as part of the I3R expert intermediary system.},

abstract = {This paper describes a possible use of Artificial Intelligence models and techniques in the design of a small Information Retrieval system. In particular, some knowledge representation models, such as semantic networks and frame-like structures, are viewed as interesting tools for the implementation of a thesaurus, and also for a description of the stored documents' contents. In addition, a parser based on the ATN (Augmented Transition Network) model which can analyze Italian sentences concerning a legal domain is described. We are including it in an user/system interface whose goal is to provide the user with the possibility of expressing search topics by using noun phrases or other linguistic expressions, rather than single words or Boolean combinations of them. Finally, some tasks requiring automated reasoning facilities are outlined. The Kernel of the system, i.e. the component which both performs traditional information retrieval and allows the insertion of new documents, is described in an appendix. It was first applied to a bibliographic database containing about a thousand references (with abstracts) of both papers and books concerned with Artificial Intelligence; now we are working on its application to a legal domain, with a database of laws, decrees and sentences concerning pollution and environmental protection.},

The original query is thus automatically converted into one or more “semantically close” ones. “Semantically close” means that the data possibly obtained with the new query will give useful information about the data originally searched for.},

The narrowed down vocabulary is further optimized with the inclusion of term phrases and virtual terms corresponding to high and low frequency terms respectively. The results of performance experimentation which proved significant improvements of index vocabulary optimization are presented. The exploitation of the term discrimination value concept in index and retrieval system tuning and optimization is discussed.},

The random indexing is then modified by means of a feedback mechanism derived from a normal probability model and applied to both the request and document representations. Of interest is the convergence properties of the representation vectors. After few feedback iterations, it is found that well defined clusters form that accurately represent the corelevance structure among the documents—in effect the feedback mechanism has permitted the documents to index themselves. This approach offers an interesting way to extend the dimensionality of the indexing vocabulary. Both this application and a theoretical analysis of the impact of extending the indexing vocabulary are discussed.},

In this model, the indexing weight of a descriptor in a document is an estimate of the probability of relevance of this document with respect to queries using this descriptor. The retrieval-with-probabilistic-indexing (RPI) model is suited to different kinds of probabilistic indexing. Therefore we assume that each indexing model has its own concept of 'correctness' to which the probabilities relate. The concept of correctness is not necessarily identical with the concept of relevance, it is only required to depend on relevance. In addition to the probabilistic indexing weights, the RPI model provides the possibility of relevance weighting of search terms. Both retrieval models are compared in experiments, showing equally good results.},

The Two Poisson Effectiveness Hypothesis suggests that retrieval models based upon the two Poisson model will outperform binary independent models when used on a “real-world” database, where independence and two Poisson term occurrence distributions fail to hold, because the added information obtained from incorporating term frequency information will more than compensate for the non-Poisson distributions of terms. Searches of the MED1033 database suggest that if terms are not independent and frequencies of term occurrence are not distributed in a two Poisson manner, the binary independence sequential retrieval model outperforms the two Poisson independence retrieval model.},

abstract = {A theory of indexing is presented and is based on viewing a document as constituted of components. A component may be chosen as any run of text unit that can be: (a) judged as to its relevancy property; and (b) considered as independent within the document. By looking at the constituent components of a document in relation to the universe of all components from the collection, we have been able to apply Bayes' decision theory to derive the index term representation for the document, as well as attaching an initial probabilistic weight for each term based on a Principle of Document Self-Recovery. It turns out that different choices of document components, such as a word or a whole abstract, can lead to different term weighting schemes that have been introduced before and are based on probability considerations; specifically, Edmundson and Wyllys' term significance formula, Sparck Jones' inverse document frequency, and later modified by Croft and Harper into the 'combination match' formula. Thus, a unified interpretation of various probabilistic term weighting schemes appears possible.},
