abstract = {The last winner of the Salton Award, Tefko Saracevic, gave an acceptance address at SIGIR in Philadelphia in 1997. Previous winners were William Cooper (1994), Cyril Cleverdon (1991), Karen Sparck Jones (1988) and Gerard Salton himself (1985).In this talk, I plan to follow the tradition of acceptance addresses, and present a personal view of and retrospective on some of the areas in which I work. However, I will not be saying much about what are perhaps the two most obvious parts of my work: the probabilistic approach to retrieval and evaluation of retrieval systems. Rather I will attempt to get under the skin of my take on IR, by discussing the nature of theoretical argument in the field, partly through examples. This talk is about the place of theory in the study of information retrieval (in some sense following Bill Cooper's 1994 topic), but not so much Theory with a capital T — rather what might be described as small-t theory.The field has a very strong pragmatic orientation, reflected both in the attitudes of the commercial participants and in the emphasis on formal evaluation in the academic environment. Nevertheless, there are many theoretical ideas buried in, or implied by, the ways we talk about the field — the language we use to discuss it. I will be discussing two areas to illustrate these low-level theoretical ideas: precision devices, and the apparent symmetry between retrieval and filtering.The phrase `precision device' used to have a rather clear meaning in IR, in the days of set-based retrieval systems. In that context, a precision device was a device to enable the restriction of the retrieved set to those most likely (out of the documents originally included) to be useful. These days, with the ubiquitous scoring and ranking methods largely replacing set-based retrieval, the idea has lost its meaning It is worth exploring the formal relationships involved to understand the change a little better.My second area is to do with the relation between filtering and the more traditional type of adhoc information retrieval. There is a tendency and a temptation to see these as the same kind of thing, sometimes with a more specific assumption of duality, based on the inversion of the roles of documents and queries. It is important to see how far this parallel extends, and where it breaks down. I explore the nature of the duality and the kinds of reasons why it does break down.These examples reflect my interest in the basic logical structure of information retrieval systems and the situations in which such systems may be found. I argue for a certain level of logical argument in information retrieval, which might be taken as small-t theory, though not as capital-T Theory. I believe there are reasons to think a Grand Theory of IR to be an unattainable goal — such a theory would have to encompass so many different aspects of retrieval, having to do for example with human cognition and behaviour and the structure of knowledge, as well as with the statistical concepts that inform the probabilistic approach.However, accepting the unattainability of a Grand Theory does not preclude the development of further and more useful models based on particular aspects and lower-level logic The low-level logic is important not only in its own right, but as the basis for linking together more sophisticated theories concerned with more restricted domains. The most elaborate and complete theory of (say) user behaviour is of no use at all without a strong linkage between the parts of that theory and the entities relevant to IR that fall outside its scope. The glue that provides that linkage has to be low-level logic.},

This study categorizes the types of information in documents being used in writing a research proposal for a master's thesis by eleven students throughout the various stages of the proposal writing process. The role of the specificity of the searched information in influencing its contribution is analyzed. The results demonstrate that different types of information are sought at different stages of the writing process and thus the contribution of the information also differs at the different stages. The categories of the contributing information can be understood of topicality.},

Laboratory-based research neglects the searcher and studies suboptimal queries. Research on operational systems fails to make a distinction between searcher performance and system performance. This approach is neither capable of measuring performance at standard points of operation (e.g. across R0.0-R1.0).A new laboratory-based evaluation method for Boolean IR systems is proposed. It is based on a controlled formulation of inclusive query plans, on an automatic conversion of query plans into elementary queries, and on combining elementary queries into optimal queries at standard points of operation. Major results of a large case experiment are reported. The validity, reliability, and efficiency of the method are considered in the light of empirical and analytical test data.},

It validates several of the rules-of-thumb experimenters use, such as the number of queries needed for a good experiment is at least 25 and 50 is better, while challenging other beliefs, such as the common evaluation measures are equally reliable. As an example, we show that Precision at 30 documents has about twice the average error rate as Average Precision has. These results can help information retrieval researchers design experiments that provide a desired level of confidence in their results. In particular, we suggest researchers using Web measures such as Precision at 10 documents will need to use many more than 50 queries or will have to require two methods to have a very large difference in evaluation scores before concluding that the two methods are actually different.},

abstract = {This paper proposes evaluation methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance judgements in IR experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In-Query1) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.},

Existing learning techniques must be adapted or improved in order to effectively handle difficult situations where the number of positive training instances per event is extremely small, the majority of training documents are unlabelled, and most of the events have a short duration in time. We adapted several supervised text categorization methods, specifically several new variants of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm and a Rocchio approach, to track events. All of these methods showed significant improvement (up to 71% reduction in weighted error rates) over the performance of the original kNN algorithm on TDT benchmark collections, making kNN among the top-performing systems in the recent TDT3 official evaluation. Furthermore, by combining these methods, we significantly reduced the variance in performance of our event tracking system over different data collections, suggesting a robust solution for parameter optimization.},

The length of these n-grams and the degree to which we precisely represent the intervals are variables analyzed in this paper. We constructed a collection of “musical word” databases using the text-based, SMART information retrieval system. A group of simulated queries, some of which contained simulated errors, was run against these databases. The results were evaluated using the normalized precision and normalized recall measures. Our concept of “musical words” shows great merit thus implying that useful MIR systems can be constructed simply and efficiently using pre-existing text-based information retrieval software. Second, this study is a formal and comprehensive evaluation of a MIR system using rigorous statistical analyses to determine retrieval effectiveness.},

We evaluate this method of spoken document retrieval against word-based retrieval for the search levels identified in a realistic video-based distributed learning setting. Using our test data, we achieved an average recall of 0.88 with an average precision of 0.69 for retrieval of out-of-vocabulary words on phonetic transcripts with 35% word error rate.

The sources of evidence consist of input from face detection/recognition and text/HTML analysis modules. A degree of uncertainty is involved with both of these sources. Diogenes automatically determines the uncertainty locally for each retrieval and uses this information to set a relative significance for each evidence. To our knowledge, Diogenes is the first image search engine using Dempster-Shafer evidence combination based on automatic object recognition and dynamic local uncertainty assessment.

The model is based on a structured bilingual dictionary in which the translations of each term are clustered into groups with distinct meanings. Query translation is modeled as a two-stage process, with the system first determining the intended meaning of a query term and then selecting translations appropriate to that meaning that might appear in the document collection. An implementation of structured translation based on automatic dictionary clustering is described and evaluated by using Chinese queries to retrieve English documents. Structured translation achieved an average precision that was statistically indistinguishable from Pirkola's technique for very short queries, but Pirkola's technique outperformed structured translation on long queries. The paper concludes with some observations on future work to improve retrieval effectiveness and on other potential uses of structured translation in interactive cross-language retrieval applications.},

abstract = {The recognition of Proper Nouns (PNs) is considered an important task in the area of Information Retrieval and Extraction. However the high performance of most existing PN classifiers heavily depends upon the availability of large dictionaries of domain-specific Proper Nouns, and a certain amount of manual work for rule writing or manual tagging. Though it is not a heavy requirement to rely on some existing PN dictionary (often these resources are available on the web), its coverage of a domain corpus may be rather low, in absence of manual updating. In this paper we propose a technique for the automatic updating of an PN Dictionary through the cooperation of an inductive and a probabilistic classifier.

abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to tackle three important problems of text normalization: sentence boundary disambiguation, disambiguation of capitalized words when they are used in positions where capitalization is expected, and identification of abbreviations. The main feature of our approach is that it uses a minimum of pre-built resources, instead dynamically inferring disambiguation clues from the entire document itself. This makes it domain independent, closely targeted to each individual document and portable to other languages. We thoroughly evaluated this approach on several corpora and it showed high accuracy.},

abstract = {We introduce OCELOT, a prototype system for automatically generating the “gist” of a web page by summarizing it. Although most text summarization research to date has focused on the task of news articles, web pages are quite different in both structure and content. Instead of coherent text with a well-defined discourse structure, they are more often likely to be a chaotic jumble of phrases, links, graphics and formatting commands. Such text provides little foothold for extractive summarization techniques, which attempt to generate a summary of a document by excerpting a contiguous, coherent span of text from it. This paper builds upon recent work in non-extractive summarization, producing the gist of a web page by “translating” it into a more concise representation rather than attempting to extract a text span verbatim. OCELOT uses probabilistic models to guide it in selecting and ordering words into a gist. This paper describes a technique for learning these models automatically from a collection of human-summarized web pages.},

We present an approach to the design of an automatic text summarizer that generates a summary by extracting sentence segments. First, sentences are broken into segments by special cue markers. Each segment is represented by a set of predefined features (e.g. location of the segment, average term frequencies of the words occurring in the segment, number of title words in the segment, and the like). Then a supervised learning algorithm is used to train the summarizer to extract important sentence segments, based on the feature vector. Results of experiments on U.S. patents indicate that the performance of the proposed approach compares very favorably with other approaches (including Microsoft Word summarizer) in terms of precision, recall, and classification accuracy.},

An alternative approach has recently been proposed, whereby a Naive Bayesian classifier is trained automatically to detect spam messages. We test this approach on a large collection of personal e-mail messages, which we make publicly available in “encrypted” form contributing towards standard benchmarks. We introduce appropriate cost-sensitive measures, investigating at the same time the effect of attribute-set size, training-corpus size, lemmatization, and stop lists, issues that have not been explored in previous experiments. Finally, the Naive Bayesian filter is compared, in terms of performance, to a filter that uses keyword patterns, and which is part of a widely used e-mail reader.},

In particular, boosting methods such as AdaBoost have shown good performance applied to real text data. However, most of existing boosting algorithms are based on classifiers that use binary-valued features. Thus, they do not fully make use of the weight information provided by standard term weighting methods. In this paper, we present a boosting-based learning method for text filtering that uses naive Bayes classifiers as a weak learner. The use of naive Bayes allows the boosting algorithm to utilize term frequency information while maintaining probabilistically accurate confidence ratio. Applied to TREC-7 and TREC-8 filtering track documents, the proposed method obtained a significant improvement in LF1, LF2, F1 and F3 measures compared to the best results submitted by other TREC entries.},

Generally, filtering systems calculate the similarity between the profile and each incoming document, and retrieve documents with similarity higher than a threshold. However, many systems set a relatively high threshold to reduce retrieval of non-relevant documents, which results in the ignorance of many relevant documents. In this paper, we propose the use of a non-relevant information profile to reduce the mistaken retrieval of non-relevant documents. Results from experiments show that this filter has successfully rejected a sufficient number of non-relevant documents, resulting in an improvement of filtering performance.},

Creating a reusable QA test collection is fundamentally more difficult than creating a document retrieval test collection since the QA task has no equivalent to document identifiers.},

Given a joint empirical distribution of words and documents, p(x, y), we first cluster the words, Y, so that the obtained word clusters, Ytilde;, maximally preserve the information on the documents. The resulting joint distribution. p(X, Ytilde;), contains most of the original information about the documents, I(X; Ytilde;) ≈ I(X; Y), but it is much less sparse and noisy. Using the same procedure we then cluster the documents, X, so that the information about the word-clusters is preserved. Thus, we first find word-clusters that capture most of the mutual information about to set of documents, and then find document clusters, that preserve the information about the word clusters. We tested this procedure over several document collections based on subsets taken from the standard 20Newsgroups corpus. The results were assessed by calculating the correlation between the document clusters and the correct labels for these documents. Finding from our experiments show that this double clustering procedure, which uses the information bottleneck method, yields significantly superior performance compared to other common document distributional clustering algorithms. Moreover, the double clustering procedure improves all the distributional clustering methods examined here.},

The best performance was achieved with dimensional reduction rates that were 43% higher than SVD on average. Our algorithm creates basis vectors for a reduced space by iteratively “scaling” vectors and computing eigenvectors. Unlike SVD, it breaks the symmetry of documents and terms to capture information more evenly across documents. We also discuss correlation with a probabilistic model and evaluate a method for selecting the dimensionality using log-likelihood estimation.},

Through an extensive series of experiments with more than 40,000 documents from multiple news sources and modalities, we establish that both the choice of clustering algorithm and the introduction of the additional features have an impact on clustering performance.

abstract = {The proliferation of online information resources increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed searching. Distributed searching is cast in three parts — database selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval performance. We look at retrieval performance in three different distributed retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database. Second we find that good performance can be achieved when only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local information can be used to achieve superior performance. This means that distributed systems can be engineered with more autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that improvements in database selection can lead to broader improvements in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good selection mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selection step.},

abstract = {The explosion of content in distributed information retrieval (IR) systems requires new mechanisms to attain timely and accurate retrieval of unstructured text. In this paper, we compare two mechanisms to improve IR system performance: partial collection replication and caching. When queries have locality, both mechanisms return results more quickly than sending queries to the original collection(s). Caches return results when queries exactly match a previous one. Partial replicas are a form of caching that return results when the IR technology determines the query is a good match. Caches are simpler and faster, but replicas can increase locality by detecting similarity between queries that are not exactly the same. We use real traces from THOMAS and Excite to measure query locality and similarity. With a very restrictive definition of query similarity, similarity improves query locality up to 15% over exact match. We use a validated simulator to compare their performance, and find that even if the partial replica hit rate increases only 3 to 6%, it will outperform simple caching under a variety of configurations. A combined approach will probably yield the best performance.},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of hierarchical structure for classifying a large, heterogeneous collection of web content. The hierarchical structure is initially used to train different second-level classifiers. In the hierarchical case, a model is learned to distinguish a second-level category from other categories within the same top level. In the flat non-hierarchical case, a model distinguishes a second-level category from all other second-level categories. Scoring rules can further take advantage of the hierarchy by considering only second-level categories that exceed a threshold at the top level.We use support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, which have been shown to be efficient and effective for classification, but not previously explored in the context of hierarchical classification. We found small advantages in accuracy for hierarchical models over flat models. For the hierarchical approach, we found the same accuracy using a sequential Boolean decision rule and a multiplicative decision rule. Since the sequential approach is much more efficient, requiring only 14%-16% of the comparisons used in the other approaches, we find it to be a good choice for classifying text into large hierarchical structures.},

The focus was to evaluate aspects of the search process. Cognitive load was measured using a secondary digit-monitoring task to quantify the effort of the user in various search states; independent relevance judgements were employed to gauge the quality of the documents accessed during the search process. Time was monitored in various search states. Results indicated the directory-based search does not offer increased relevance over the query-based search (with or without query formulation assistance), and also takes longer. Query reformulation does significantly improve the relevance of the documents through which the user must trawl versus standard query-based internet search. However, the improvement in document relevance comes at the cost of increased search time and increased cognitive load.},

abstract = {Most information retrieval systems on the Internet rely primarily on similarity ranking algorithms based solely on term frequency statistics. Information quality is usually ignored. This leads to the problem that documents are retrieved without regard to their quality. We present an approach that combines similarity-based similarity ranking with quality ranking in centralized and distributed search environments. Six quality metrics, including the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio, authority, popularity, and cohesiveness, were investigated. Search effectiveness was significantly improved when the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio and page cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in centralized search. The improvement seen when the availability, information-to- noise ratio, popularity, and cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in site selection was also significant. Finally, incorporating the popularity metric in information fusion resulted in a significant improvement. In summary, the results show that incorporating quality metrics can generally improve search effectiveness in both centralized and distributed search environments.},

Users face a daunting challenge in identifying a small subset of documents worthy of their attention.Link analysis algorithms have received much interest recently, in large part for their potential to identify high quality items. We report here on an experimental evaluation of this potential.We evaluated a number of link and content-based algorithms using a dataset of web documents rated for quality by human topic experts. Link-based metrics did a good job of picking out high-quality items. Precision at 5 is about 0.75, and precision at 10 is about 0.55; this is in a dataset where 0.32 of all documents were of high quality. Surprisingly, a simple content-based metric performed nearly as well; ranking documents by the total number of pages on their containing site.},

abstract = {Text categorization is one of the key functions for utilizing vast amount of documents. It can be seen as a classification problem, which has been studied in pattern recognition and machine learning fields for a long time and several classification methods have been developed such as statistical classification, decision tree, support vector machines and so on. Many researchers applied those classification methods to text categorization and reported their performance (e.g., decision tree[3], Bayes classifier[2], support vector machine[l]). Yang conducted comprehensive study of comparison or text categorization and reported that k nearest neighbor and support vector machines works well for text categorization[4].In the previous studies, classification methods were usually compared using single pair of training and test data However, classification method with more complex family of classifiers requires more training data and small training data may result in deriving unreliable classifier, that is, the performance of the derived classifier varies much depending on training data. Therefore, we need to take the size of training data into account when comparing and selecting a classification method. In this paper, we discuss how to select a classifier from those derived by various classification methods and how the size of training data affects the performance of the derived classifier.In order to evaluate the reliability of classification method, we consider the variance of accuracy of derived classifier. We first construct a statistical model. In the text categorization, each document is usually represented with a feature vector that consists of weighted frequencies of terms. In the vector space model, document is a point in high dimensional feature space and a classifier separates the feature space into subspaces each of which is labeled with a category.},

abstract = {Although n-gram (n successive characters) indexing is widely used in retrieval systems for documents in Japanese and other Asian languages, it is difficult to process ranking retrieval efficiently using n-gram indexing. This is because frequency information for query words needs to be computed using indexed data since this information is not directly available from the n-gram index. To reduce processing costs, this paper proposes a pseudo-frequency method, which uses a word's estimated frequencies instead of precise ones. The results of experiments on NTCIR, a Japanese IR test collection, showed that the proposed method speeded up retrieval without degrading retrieval effectiveness.},

abstract = {The recent development of communication networks and multimedia system provides users with the availability of a huge amount of information making worse the problem of information overload [9]. The evolution of system design is necessary becoming more user centred, and more personally involving. A review of survey studies on Internet users since 1993 confirms that a greater percentage of people are becoming online citizens, and professionals are integrating more online components into their work process. A review of the experimental literature on Internet user's reveals that there is intense interest in humanising the online environment by integrating affective and cognitive components [8].We are specially in concern with the effects on the evolution on information retrieval. We can notice significant changes in the information retrieval world over the past five or so years due to the emergence of Internet and one of its most important and widely used services, the world wide Web (WWW) or simply the Web.While reviewing the progress of research in information retrieval and user modelling, we can observe that many systems and prtotypes are created [5], [10], [11], but all of them, share some basic limitations: the techniques used to represent knowledge in the user model is based on simple list of keyword, the type of the considered knowledge is very limited, usually restricted to single word, or to (some) structural characteristic: the learning capability are very poor.We aim to propose a cognitive approach for building user model in an information retrieval context. In fact cognitive approach is based on identifying how users process information and what constitutes an appropriate model to represent this process, and because IR, under the cognitive paradigm takes the user into account in a high-priority way [1]. However, within the cognitive paradigm, there is no general model valid for our documentary approach that satisfactorily how user knowledge is represented for the purpose of processing information. The lack of such a model does not allow one to identify a user's cognitive state with regard to his or her information needs and requirements.Methodology adopting the cognitive viewpoint in IR are Synthesised by Daniel [4] in three groups, which comprise the representation of:
users and their problem, which stems from the hypothesis proposed by Belkin on the `anomalous states of knowledge' (ASK), according to which the user searches for informationsearch strategy, which compile the different ways search strategies and processes are carried out, depending on the variable involved - user, intermediary, IR systems [6],[7]document and information, which is considered a major goal of current IR research, since it embraces the whole corpus of studies about user models intended to eliminate the intermediary's role in retrieval system. The aim of this approach is to allow users direct access to the system by means of the representation of documents and intelligent interfaces.User-centered paradigm now dominates in studies of information needs and information retrieval. We have the goal of developing new approaches to information retrieval which are based on user modelling techniques for building and managing the representation of the user preferances. In this paper, we describe two complementary approaches which are necessary for building user model and its integration in an information retrieval system:
a conceptual one based on the description of knowledge needed by the user in an information retrieval context,a functional approach which deals with dynamic aspects of the model. Within this approach we aim to determine the role played by the model in an information retrieval context.In many studies of IR interesting in user modelling we find different kind of knowledge trying to describe user's need. So our conceptual approach has consisted in enumerating these knowledge and integrating them in their adequate components in information retrieval architecture. Almost of these studies that identified cognitive characteristics have used quantitative methods to measure them. What is needed is a qualitative study and appropriate method to ascertain these cognitive characteristic [12].Our main objective is the development of techniques for modelling the user as an interactive part of IR, so we propose our functional approach which deals with identifying cognitive characteristic within the role played by the user model in an information retrieval architecture. So we began by presenting the conceptual approach and so the functional one.},

With the advent of such systems and their usage in classroom teaching, at conferences, etc., there is an increasing need for techniques and abilities which enable users to search in those documents and to localize some specific information. In this paper we describe how we integrated information retrieval techniques into the Authoring on the Fly (AOF) system, an approach for automatic presentation recording. We have chosen the AOF system for two reasons. On the one hand, it is a well-established way for presentation recording, used by various universities and institutions1. On the other hand it is general enough to illustrate typical problems and challenges a developer is facing when designing a system for information retrieval from multimedia data streams which occur in the presentation recording scenario.},

The generalized vector space model of information retrieval represents a document by a vector of its similarities to all other documents. The process of collaborative filtering is nearly identical to the process of retrieval using GVSM in a matrix of user ratings. Using this observation, a model for filtering collaboratively using document content is possible.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the learning behavior of a heuristic threshold setting approach to information filtering. In particular, we study how different initial threshold settings and different updating parameter settings affect threshold learning. The results on one of the TREC news databases indicate that (1) learning allows recovery from the inevitable non-optimality of the initial conditions, and (2) a greater “willingness to learn” (expressed by a deliberate lowering of the score threshold in the learning stage) does eventually lead to a higher performance in spite of the expected initial performance penalty.},

This combines traditional information retrieval and the slicing, dicing, drill-down, and roll-up of OLAP. We demonstrate use of a prototype for searching documents from the TREC collection.},

SWAMI consists of three components: a prediction engine, an evaluation system, and a visualization component. The prediction engine provides a common interface for implementing different prediction algorithms. The evaluation system provides a standardized testing methodology and metrics for analyzing the accuracy and run-time performance of prediction algorithms. The visualization component suggests how graphical representations can inform the development and analysis of prediction algorithms. We demonstrate SWAMI on the Each Movie data set by comparing three prediction algorithms: a traditional Pearson correlation-based method, support vector machines, and a new accurate and scalable correlation-based method based on clustering techniques.},

abstract = {In the World Wide Web, myriads of hyperlinks connect documents and pages to create an unprecedented, highly complex graph structure - the Web graph. This paper presents a novel approach to learning probabilistic models of the Web, which can be used to make reliable predictions about connectivity and information content of Web documents. The proposed method is a probabilistic dimension reduction technique which recasts and unites Latent Semantic Analysis and Kleinberg's Hubs-and-Authorities algorithm in a statistical setting.This meant to be a first step towards the development of a statistical foundation for Web—related information technologies. Although this paper does not focus on a particular application, a variety of algorithms operating in the Web/Internet environment can take advantage of the presented techniques, including search engines, Web crawlers, and information agent systems.},

Several sets of transcriptions were created for the TREC-8 SDR task using a speech recognition system varying the vocabulary sizes and OOV rates, and the relative retrieval performance measured. The effects of OOV terms on a simple baseline IR system and on more sophisticated retrieval systems are described. The use of a parallel corpus for query and document expansion is found to be especially beneficial, and with this data set, good retrieval performance can be achieved even for fairly high OOV rates.},

By gathering simple statistics on the average performance of a given set of query retrieval systems, we construct a Bayes optimal mechanism for combining the outputs of these systems. Our construction yields a metasearch strategy whose empirical performance nearly always exceeds the performance of any of the constituent systems. Our construction is also robust in the sense that if “good” and “bad” systems are combined, the Performance of the composite is still on par with, or exceeds, that of the best constituent system. Finally, our model and theory provide theoretical and empirical avenues for the improvement of this metasearch strategy.},

abstract = {Intuitively, words forming phrases are a more precise description of content than words as a sequence of keywords. Yet, evidence that phrases would be more effective for information retrieval is inconclusive. This paper isolates a neglected class of phrases, that is abundant in communication, has an established theoretical foundation, and shows promise for an effective expression of the user's information need: the noun-noun compound (NNC). In an experiment, a variety of meaningful NNCs were used to isolate relevant passages in a large and varied corpus. In a first pass, passages were retrieved based on textual proximity of the words or their semantic peers. A second pass retained only passages containing a syntactically coherent structure equivalent to the original NNC. This second pass showed a dramatic increase in precision. Preliminary results show the validity of our intuition about phrases in the special but very productive case of NNCs.},
