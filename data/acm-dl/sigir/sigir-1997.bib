whole-document ranking. It provides convenient units of text to
return to the user, avoids the difficulties of comparing documents
of different length, and enables identification of short blocks of
relevant material amongst otherwise irrelevant text. In this paper
we explore the potential of passage retrieval, based on an
experimental evaluation of the ability of passages to identify
relevant documents. We compare our scheme of arbitrary passage
retrieval to several other document retrieval and passage retrieval
methods; we show experimentally that, compared to these methods,
ranking via fixed-length passages is robust and effective. Our
experiments also show that, compared to whole-document ranking,
ranking via fixed-length arbitrary passages significantly improves
retrieval effectiveness, by 8% for TREC disks 2 and 4 and by
18%-37% for the Federal Register collection.},
