abstract = {There has historically been a divide between the user-oriented and system-oriented research communities in information retrieval. In my opinion, this divide is based primarily on a difference in viewpoint about the relative importance of understanding how people search for information compared to developing new retrieval models and ranking algorithms. There is strong agreement, however, that the interaction between the user and the search engine is a fundamental part of the IR process. The IR field was one of the first in computer science to recognize the importance of the user-system interaction, which led to a number of core concepts such as relevance, ranking, result presentation, feedback, evaluation, and browsing. The key message of this talk is that effective information access requires interaction between the user and the system, where both play a role. Additionally, there is growing evidence that even more effective information access can be achieved by a system that actively supports interaction, particularly in the limited-bandwidth environments provided by mobile devices and voice-based assistants. In this talk, I will first give an overview of past IR research on user-system interaction. In much of this research, the system provides passive support for the retrieval process and much of the burden for effective retrieval stays with the user. There has been some research, however, that has attempted to actively support the interaction by designing expert intermediary systems. After this review, I will focus on two current areas of research where active support for interaction is crucial. These are question answering and conversational search. These areas have recently become popular in the NLP community but they have deep roots in IR. I will describe the specific lines of research we have followed at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval and RMIT, including interactive answer passage retrieval, studies of information-seeking dialogues, and neural models for selecting responses and answers. Although there are many aspects to this research, I will highlight the parts where interaction is important, how we have attempted to evaluate the research, and where significant progress needs to be made.},

In this talk, I will present recent progress of my team in this direction. I will start with presenting results on how to generate additional training data using weak annotations, motion information and synthetic data. Next, I will discuss our results for action recognition in videos, where human tubelets have shown to be successful. Our tubelet approach moves away from state-of-the-art frame based approaches and improves classification and localization by relying on joint information from several frames. We show how to extend this type of method to weakly supervised learning of actions, which allows us to scale to large amounts of data with sparse manual annotation. Finally, I will present recent work on grasping with a robot arm based on learning long-horizon manipulations with a hierarchy of RL and imitation-based skills.},

abstract = {Implicit feedback (e.g., click, dwell time) is an attractive source of training data for Learning-to-Rank, but its naive use leads to learning results that are distorted by presentation bias. For the special case of optimizing average rank for linear ranking functions, however, the recently developed SVM-PropRank method has shown that counterfactual inference techniques can be used to provably overcome the distorting effect of presentation bias. Going beyond this special case, this paper provides a general and theoretically rigorous framework for counterfactual learning-to-rank that enables unbiased training for a broad class of additive ranking metrics (e.g., Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)) as well as a broad class of models (e.g., deep networks). Specifically, we derive a relaxation for propensity-weighted rank-based metrics which is subdifferentiable and thus suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this general approach by instantiating two new learning methods. One is a new type of unbiased SVM that optimizes DCG - called SVM PropDCG - and we show how the resulting optimization problem can be solved via the Convex Concave Procedure (CCP). The other is Deep PropDCG, where the ranking function can be an arbitrary deep network. In addition to the theoretical support, we empirically find that SVM PropDCG significantly outperforms existing linear rankers in terms of DCG. Moreover, the ability to train non-linear ranking functions via Deep PropDCG further improves performance.},

abstract = {Learning to Rank (LTR) from user interactions is challenging as user feedback often contains high levels of bias and noise. At the moment, two methodologies for dealing with bias prevail in the field of LTR: counterfactual methods that learn from historical data and model user behavior to deal with biases; and online methods that perform interventions to deal with bias but use no explicit user models. For practitioners the decision between either methodology is very important because of its direct impact on end users. Nevertheless, there has never been a direct comparison between these two approaches to unbiased LTR. In this study we provide the first benchmarking of both counterfactual and online LTR methods under different experimental conditions. Our results show that the choice between the methodologies is consequential and depends on the presence of selection bias, and the degree of position bias and interaction noise. In settings with little bias or noise counterfactual methods can obtain the highest ranking performance; however, in other circumstances their optimization can be detrimental to the user experience. Conversely, online methods are very robust to bias and noise but require control over the displayed rankings. Our findings confirm and contradict existing expectations on the impact of model-based and intervention-based methods in LTR, and allow practitioners to make an informed decision between the two methodologies.},

abstract = {In the enterprise email search setting, the same search engine often powers multiple enterprises from various industries: technology, education, manufacturing, etc. However, using the same global ranking model across different enterprises may result in suboptimal search quality, due to the corpora differences and distinct information needs. On the other hand, training an individual ranking model for each enterprise may be infeasible, especially for smaller institutions with limited data. To address this data challenge, in this paper we propose a domain adaptation approach that fine-tunes the global model to each individual enterprise. In particular, we propose a novel application of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) approach to information retrieval, which attempts to bridge the gap between the global data distribution and the data distribution for a given individual enterprise. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on a large-scale email search engine, and demonstrate that the MMD approach consistently improves the search quality for multiple individual domains, both in comparison to the global ranking model, as well as several competitive domain adaptation baselines including adversarial learning methods.},

Health cards are a concise presentations of a health concept shown along side search results to specific health queries; they have the potential to convey health information in easily digestible form for the general public. However, little evidence exists on how effective health cards actually are for users when searching health advice online, and whether their effectiveness is limited to specific health search intents. To understand the impact of health cards on CHS, we conducted a laboratory study to observe users completing CHS tasks using two search interface variants: one just with result snippets and one containing both result snippets and health cards. Our study makes the following contributions: (1) it reveals how and when health cards are beneficial to users in completing consumer health search tasks, and (2) it identifies the features of health cards that helped users in completing their tasks. This is the first study that thoroughly investigates the effectiveness of health cards in supporting consumer health search.},

Large scale social platforms are currently investing important resources into automatically detecting and classifying hateful content, without much success.

In this work, we analyze this apparent contradiction between existing literature and actual applications. We study closely the experimental methodology used in prior work and their generalizability to other datasets. Our findings evidence methodological issues, as well as an important dataset bias. As a consequence, performance claims of the current state-of-the-art have become significantly overestimated. The problems that we have found are mostly related to data overfitting and sampling issues. We discuss the implications for current research and re-conduct experiments to give a more accurate picture of the current state-of-the art methods.},

abstract = {Drug effectiveness describes the capacity of a drug to cure a disease, which is of great importance for drug safety. To get this information, a number of real-world patient-oriented outcomes are required. However, current surveillance systems can only capture a small portion of them, and there is a time lag in processing the reported data. Since social media provides quantities of patient-oriented user posts in real-time, it is of great value to automatically extract drug effectiveness from these data. To this end, we build a dataset containing 25K tweets describing drug use, and further harvest drug effectiveness by performing Relation Extraction (RE) between chemicals and diseases. Most prior works about RE deal with mention pairs independently, which is not suitable for our task since interactions across mention pairs are widespread. In this paper, we propose a model regarding mention pairs as nodes connected by multiple types of edges. With the help of graph-based information transfers over time, it deals with all mention pairs simultaneously to capture their interactions. Besides, a novel idea is used to perform multiple instance learning, a big challenge in general RE tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms previous work by a substantial margin.},

Leveraging large scale user clicks from Bing search logs as weak supervision of user intent, GEN Encoder learns to map queries with shared clicks into similar embeddings end-to-end and then fine-tunes on multiple paraphrase tasks. Experimental results on an intrinsic evaluation task - query intent similarity modeling - demonstrate GEN Encoder's robust and significant advantages over previous representation methods. Ablation studies reveal the crucial role of learning from implicit user feedback in representing user intent and the contributions of multi-task learning in representation generality. We also demonstrate that GEN Encoder alleviates the sparsity of tail search traffic and cuts down half of the unseen queries by using an efficient approximate nearest neighbor search to effectively identify previous queries with the same search intent. Finally, we demonstrate distances between GEN encodings reflect certain information seeking behaviors in search sessions.},

abstract = {Benefiting from the advancement of computer vision, natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, visual question answering (VQA), which aims to answer questions about an image or a video, has received lots of attentions over the past few years. Although some progress has been achieved so far, several studies have pointed out that current VQA models are heavily affected by the language prior problem, which means they tend to answer questions based on the co-occurrence patterns of question keywords (e.g., how many) and answers (e.g., 2) instead of understanding images and questions. Existing methods attempt to solve this problem by either balancing the biased datasets or forcing models to better understand images. However, only marginal effects and even performance deterioration are observed for the first and second solution, respectively. In addition, another important issue is the lack of measurement to quantitatively measure the extent of the language prior effect, which severely hinders the advancement of related techniques.In this paper, we make contributions to solve the above problems from two perspectives. Firstly, we design a metric to quantitatively measure the language prior effect of VQA models. The proposed metric has been demonstrated to be effective in our empirical studies. Secondly, we propose a regularization method (i.e., score regularization module) to enhance current VQA models by alleviating the language prior problem as well as boosting the backbone model performance. The proposed score regularization module adopts a pair-wise learning strategy, which makes the VQA models answer the question based on the reasoning of the image (upon this question) instead of basing on question-answer patterns observed in the biased training set. The score regularization module is flexible to be integrated into various VQA models. We conducted extensive experiments over two popular VQA datasets (i.e., VQA 1.0 and VQA 2.0) and integrated the score regularization module into three state-of-the-art VQA models. Experimental results show that the score regularization module can not only effectively reduce the language prior problem of these VQA models but also consistently improve their question answering accuracy.},

abstract = {Open-domain question answering focuses on using diverse information resources to answer any types of question. Recent years, with the development of large-scale data set and various deep neural networks models, some recent advances in open domain question answering system first utilize the distantly supervised dataset as the knowledge resource, then apply deep learning based machine comprehension techniques to generate the right answers, which achieves impressive results compared with traditional feature-based pipeline methods.However, these deep learning based methods suffer from the inferior quality of the distantly supervised data, and the answer score is un-normalized among multiple documents. Furthermore, unlike previous open-domain question answering system, they process each document independently which may ignore the valuable information in the context. In this paper, we propose a document gated reader to generate the right answer from multiple documents. We propose a document-level gate operation to determine the question-document relevance and embed it into the answer generation process, and optimize it with the global normalization objective. We also develop a bootstrapping based data generation scheme to obtain high-quality training data. Experimental results on several question answering datasets show the advantage of the proposed methods.},

With the accumulation of site data, methods to detect duplicate questions in CQA sites have attracted considerable attention. Existing methods typically use only questions to complete the task. However, the paired answers may also provide valuable information. In this paper, we propose an answer information- enhanced adaptive multi-attention network (AMAN) to perform this task. AMAN takes full advantage of the semantic information in the paired answers while alleviating the noise problem caused by adding the answers. To evaluate the proposed method, we use a CQADupStack set and the Quora question-pair dataset expanded with paired answers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the above two data sets.},

This problem is most pronounced when answers can be found only by joining evidence from multiple documents. Curated knowledge graphs (KGs) may yield good answers, but are limited by their inherent incompleteness and potential staleness. This paper presents QUEST, a method that can answer complex questions directly from textual sources on-the-fly, by computing similarity joins over partial results from different documents. Our method is completely unsupervised, avoiding training-data bottlenecks and being able to cope with rapidly evolving ad hoc topics and formulation style in user questions. QUEST builds a noisy quasi KG with node and edge weights, consisting of dynamically retrieved entity names and relational phrases. It augments this graph with types and semantic alignments, and computes the best answers by an algorithm for Group Steiner Trees. We evaluate QUEST on benchmarks of complex questions, and show that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, existing studies on MRC seldom address the predictive uncertainty issue, i.e., how likely the prediction of an MRC model is wrong, leading to uncontrollable risks in real-world Web QA applications. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth investigation over the risk of Web QA. We then introduce a novel risk control framework, which consists of a qualify model for uncertainty estimation using the probe idea, and a decision model for selectively output. For evaluation, we introduce risk-related metrics, rather than the traditional EM and F1 in MRC, for the evaluation of risk-aware Web QA. The empirical results over both the real-world Web QA dataset and the academic MRC benchmark collection demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Existing item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) methods leverage only the relation of collaborative similarity - i.e., the item similarity evidenced by user interactions like ratings and purchases. Nevertheless, there exist multiple relations between items in real-world scenarios, e.g., two movies share the same director, two products complement with each other, etc. Distinct from the collaborative similarity that implies co-interact patterns from the user's perspective, these relations reveal fine-grained knowledge on items from different perspectives of meta-data, functionality, etc. However, how to incorporate multiple item relations is less explored in recommendation research.In this work, we propose Relational Collaborative Filtering (RCF) to exploit multiple item relations in recommender systems. We find that both the relation type (e.g., shared director) and the relation value (e.g., Steven Spielberg) are crucial in inferring user preference. To this end, we develop a two-level hierarchical attention mechanism to model user preference - the first-level attention discriminates which types of relations are more important, and the second-level attention considers the specific relation values to estimate the contribution of a historical item. To make the item embeddings be reflective of the relational structure between items, we further formulate a task to preserve the item relations, and jointly train it with user preference modeling. Empirical results on two real datasets demonstrate the strong performance of RCF1. Furthermore, we also conduct qualitative analyses to show the benefits of explanations brought by RCF's modeling of multiple item relations.},

abstract = {Previous highly scalable One-Class Collaborative Filtering (OC-CF) methods such as Projected Linear Recommendation (PLRec) have advocated using fast randomized SVD to embed items into a latent space, followed by linear regression methods to learn personalized recommendation models per user. However, naive SVD embedding methods often exhibit a strong popularity bias that prevents them from accurately embedding less popular items, which is exacerbated by the extreme sparsity of implicit feedback matrices in the OC-CF setting. To address this deficiency, we leverage insights from Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to derive a closed-form, efficiently computable "depopularized" embedding. We show that NCE item embeddings combined with a personalized user model from PLRec produces superior recommendations that adequately account for popularity bias. Further analysis of the popularity distribution of recommended items demonstrates that NCE-PLRec uniformly distributes recommendations over the popularity spectrum while other methods exhibit distinct biases towards specific popularity subranges. Empirically, NCE-PLRec produces highly competitive performance with run-times an order of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art approaches for OC-CF.},

abstract = {Efficiency is crucial to the online recommender systems, especially for the ones which needs to deal with tens of millions of users and items. Because representing users and items as binary vectors for Collaborative Filtering (CF) can achieve fast user-item affinity computation in the Hamming space, in recent years, we have witnessed an emerging research effort in exploiting binary hashing techniques for CF methods. However, CF with binary codes naturally suffers from low accuracy due to limited representation capability in each bit, which impedes it from modeling complex structure of the data.In this work, we attempt to improve the efficiency without hurting the model performance by utilizing both the accuracy of real-valued vectors and the efficiency of binary codes to represent users/items. In particular, we propose the Compositional Coding for Collaborative Filtering (CCCF) framework, which not only gains better recommendation efficiency than the state-of-the-art binarized CF approaches but also achieves even higher accuracy than the real-valued CF method. Specifically, CCCF innovatively represents each user/item with a set of binary vectors, which are associated with a sparse real-value weight vector. Each value of the weight vector encodes the importance of the corresponding binary vector to the user/item. The continuous weight vectors greatly enhances the representation capability of binary codes, and its sparsity guarantees the processing speed. Furthermore, an integer weight approximation scheme is proposed to further accelerate the speed. Based on the CCCF framework, we design an efficient discrete optimization algorithm to learn its parameters. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art binarized CF methods (even achieves better performance than the real-valued CF method) by a large margin in terms of both recommendation accuracy and efficiency.

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) by learning from the wisdom of crowds has become one of the most important approaches to recommender systems research, and various CF models have been designed and applied to different scenarios. However, a challenging task is how to select the most appropriate CF model for a specific recommendation task. In this paper, we propose a Unified Collaborative Filtering framework based on Graph Embeddings (UGrec for short) to solve the problem. Specifically, UGrec models user and item interactions within a graph network, and sequential recommendation path is designed as a basic unit to capture the correlations between users and items. Mathematically, we show that many representative recommendation approaches and their variants can be mapped as a recommendation path in the graph. In addition, by applying a carefully designed attention mechanism on the recommendation paths, UGrec can determine the significance of each sequential recommendation path so as to conduct automatic model selection. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method shows significant improvements for recommendation quality. This work also leads to a deeper understanding of the connection between graph embeddings and recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Learning vector representations (aka. embeddings) of users and items lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user's (or an item's) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect.In this work, we propose to integrate the user-item interactions - more specifically the bipartite graph structure - into the embedding process. We develop a new recommendation framework Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF), which exploits the user-item graph structure by propagating embeddings on it. This leads to the expressive modeling of high-order connectivity in user-item graph, effectively injecting the collaborative signal into the embedding process in an explicit manner. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over several state-of-the-art models like HOP-Rec [39] and Collaborative Memory Network [5]. Further analysis verifies the importance of embedding propagation for learning better user and item representations, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of NGCF.

abstract = {Can machines trace human knowledge like humans? Knowledge tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in a wide range of applications in education, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems. It models dynamics in a student's knowledge states in relation to different learning concepts through their interactions with learning activities. Recently, several attempts have been made to use deep learning models for tackling the KT problem. Although these deep learning models have shown promising results, they have limitations: either lack the ability to go deeper to trace how specific concepts in a knowledge state are mastered by a student, or fail to capture long-term dependencies in an exercise sequence. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a novel deep learning model for knowledge tracing, namely Sequential Key-Value Memory Networks (SKVMN). This model unifies the strengths of recurrent modelling capacity and memory capacity of the existing deep learning KT models for modelling student learning. We have extensively evaluated our proposed model on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that (1) SKVMN outperforms the state-of-the-art KT models on all datasets, (2) SKVMN can better discover the correlation between latent concepts and questions, and (3) SKVMN can trace the knowledge state of students dynamics, and a leverage sequential dependencies in an exercise sequence for improved predication accuracy.},

In contrast to wearing an extra camera to record daily life, people are used to log their life on social media platforms. In this paper, we aim to extract life events from textual data shared on Twitter and construct personal knowledge bases of individuals. The issues to be tackled include (1) not all text descriptions are related to life events, (2) life events in a text description can be expressed explicitly or implicitly, (3) the predicates in the implicit events are often absent, and (4) the mapping from natural language predicates to knowledge base relations may be ambiguous. A joint learning approach is proposed to detect life events in tweets and extract event components including subjects, predicates, objects, and time expressions. Finally, the extracted information is transformed to knowledge base facts. The evaluation is performed on a collection of lifelogs from 18 Twitter users. Experimental results show our proposed system is effective in life event extraction, and the constructed personal knowledge bases are expected to be useful to memory recall applications.},

Identifying entity properties is similar to a relation extraction task that can be cast as a classification of sentences. Normally, this task can be achieved by distant supervised learning by automatically preparing training sentences for each property; however, it is impractical to prepare training sentences for every property. Therefore, we describe a zero-shot learning problem for this task and propose a neural network-based model that does not rely on a complete training set comprising training sentences for every property. To achieve this, we utilize embeddings of properties obtained from a knowledge graph embedding using different components of a knowledge graph structure. The embeddings of properties are combined with the model to enable identification of properties with no available training sentences. By using our newly constructed dataset as well as an existing dataset, experiments revealed that our model achieved a better performance for properties with no training sentences, relative to baseline results, even comparable to that achieved for properties with training sentences.},

abstract = {Learning the dependency relations among entities and the hierarchy formed by these relations by mapping entities into some order embedding space can effectively enable several important applications, including knowledge base completion and prerequisite relations prediction. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to learn a good order embedding due to the existence of partial ordering and missing relations in the observed data. Moreover, most application scenarios do not provide non-trivial negative dependency relation instances. We therefore propose a framework that performs dependency relation prediction by exploring both rich semantic and hierarchical structure information in the data. In particular, we propose several negative sampling strategies based on graph-specific centrality properties, which supplement the positive dependency relations with appropriate negative samples to effectively learn order embeddings. This research not only addresses the needs of automatically recovering missing dependency relations, but also unravels dependencies among entities using several real-world datasets, such as course dependency hierarchy involving course prerequisite relations, job hierarchy in organizations, and paper citation hierarchy. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the prediction accuracy as well as to gain insights using the learned order embedding.},

abstract = {Many previous studies attempt to utilize information from other domains to achieve better performance of recommendation. Recently, social information has been shown effective in improving recommendation results with transfer learning frameworks, and the transfer part helps to learn users' preferences from both item domain and social domain. However, two vital issues have not been well-considered in existing methods: 1) Usually, a static transfer scheme is adopted to share a user's common preference between item and social domains, which is not robust in real life where the degrees of sharing and information richness are varied for different users. Hence a non-personalized transfer scheme may be insufficient and unsuccessful. 2) Most previous neural recommendation methods rely on negative sampling in training to increase computational efficiency, which makes them highly sensitive to sampling strategies and hence difficult to achieve optimal results in practical applications.To address the above problems, we propose an Efficient Adaptive Transfer Neural Network (EATNN). By introducing attention mechanisms, the proposed model automatically assign a personalized transfer scheme for each user. Moreover, we devise an efficient optimization method to learn from the whole training set without negative sampling, and further extend it to support multi-task learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets indicate that our EATNN method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on Top-K recommendation task, especially for cold-start users who have few item interactions. Remarkably, EATNN shows significant advantages in training efficiency, which makes it more practical to be applied in real E-commerce scenarios.

abstract = {Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users, with these trusted users are influenced by the trusted users' social connections. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could be applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than 13% performance improvements over the best baselines for top-10 recommendation on the two datasets.},

abstract = {In this paper, we aim to solve the automatic playlist continuation (APC) problem by modeling complex interactions among users, playlists, and songs using only their interaction data. Prior methods mainly rely on dot product to account for similarities, which is not ideal as dot product is not metric learning, so it does not convey the important inequality property. Based on this observation, we propose three novel deep learning approaches that utilize Mahalanobis distance. Our first approach uses user-playlist-song interactions, and combines Mahalanobis distance scores between (i) a target user and a target song, and (ii) between a target playlist and the target song to account for both the user's preference and the playlist's theme. Our second approach measures song-song similarities by considering Mahalanobis distance scores between the target song and each member song (i.e., existing song) in the target playlist. The contribution of each distance score is measured by our proposed memory metric-based attention mechanism. In the third approach, we fuse the two previous models into a unified model to further enhance their performance.

abstract = {This paper proposes Medley of Sub-Attention Networks (MoSAN), a new novel neural architecture for the group recommendation task. Group-level recommendation is known to be a challenging task, in which intricate group dynamics have to be considered. As such, this is to be contrasted with the standard recommendation problem where recommendations are personalized with respect to a single user. Our proposed approach hinges upon the key intuition that the decision making process (in groups) is generally dynamic, i.e., a user's decision is highly dependent on the other group members. All in all, our key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures fine-grained interactions between group members. In our MoSAN model, each sub-attention module is representative of a single member, which models a user's preference with respect to all other group members. Subsequently, a Medley of Sub-Attention modules is then used to collectively make the group's final decision. Overall, our proposed model is both expressive and effective. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that MoSAN not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also improves standard baselines by a considerable margin.},

abstract = {Most recommender systems base their recommendations on implicit or explicit item-level feedback provided by users. These item ratings are combined into a complex user model, which then predicts the suitability of other items. While effective, such methods have limited scrutability and transparency. For instance, if a user's interests change, then many item ratings would usually need to be modified to significantly shift the user's recommendations. Similarly, explaining how the system characterizes the user is impossible, short of presenting the entire list of known item ratings. In this paper, we present a new set-based recommendation technique that permits the user model to be explicitly presented to users in natural language, empowering users to understand recommendations made and improve the recommendations dynamically. While performing comparably to traditional collaborative filtering techniques in a standard static setting, our approach allows users to efficiently improve recommendations. Further, it makes it easier for the model to be validated and adjusted, building user trust and understanding.},

abstract = {User reviews contain rich semantics towards the preference of users to features of items. Recently, many deep learning based solutions have been proposed by exploiting reviews for recommendation. The attention mechanism is mainly adopted in these works to identify words or aspects that are important for rating prediction. However, it is still hard to understand whether a user likes or dislikes an aspect of an item according to what viewpoint the user holds and to what extent, without examining the review details. Here, we consider a pair of a viewpoint held by a user and an aspect of an item as a logic unit. Reasoning a rating behavior by discovering the informative logic units from the reviews and resolving their corresponding sentiments could enable a better rating prediction with explanation.To this end, in this paper, we propose a capsule network based model for rating prediction with user reviews, named CARP. For each user-item pair, CARP is devised to extract the informative logic units from the reviews and infer their corresponding sentiments. The model firstly extracts the viewpoints and aspects from the user and item review documents respectively. Then we derive the representation of each logic unit based on its constituent viewpoint and aspect. A sentiment capsule architecture with a novel Routing by Bi-Agreement mechanism is proposed to identify the informative logic unit and the sentiment based representations in user-item level for rating prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted over seven real-world datasets with diverse characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed CARP obtains substantial performance gain over recently proposed state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy. Further analysis shows that our model can successfully discover the interpretable reasons at a finer level of granularity.},

Unlike most existing approaches that only focus on leveraging knowledge graphs for more accurate recommendation, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge for decision making so that the recommendations are generated and supported by an interpretable causal inference procedure. To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featured by an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function. Third, we design a policy-guided graph search algorithm to efficiently and effectively sample reasoning paths for recommendation. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Latent factor models have achieved great success in personalized recommendations, but they are also notoriously difficult to explain. In this work, we integrate regression trees to guide the learning of latent factor models for recommendation, and use the learnt tree structure to explain the resulting latent factors. Specifically, we build regression trees on users and items respectively with user-generated reviews, and associate a latent profile to each node on the trees to represent users and items. With the growth of regression tree, the latent factors are gradually refined under the regularization imposed by the tree structure. As a result, we are able to track the creation of latent profiles by looking into the path of each factor on regression trees, which thus serves as an explanation for the resulting recommendations. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews demonstrate the advantage of our model over several competitive baseline algorithms. Besides, our extensive user study also confirms the practical value of explainable recommendations generated by our model.},

It is an open problem how to leverage such an advancement for privacy-aware ranking, which is important for top K document search on the cloud. Since neural ranking adds more complexity in score computation, it is difficult to prevent the server from discovering embedding-based semantic features and inferring privacy-sensitive information. This paper analyzes the critical leakages in interaction-based neural ranking and studies countermeasures to mitigate such a leakage. It proposes a privacy-aware neural ranking scheme that integrates tree ensembles with kernel value obfuscation and a soft match map based on adaptively-clustered term closures. The paper also presents an evaluation with two TREC datasets on the relevance of the proposed techniques and the trade-offs for privacy and storage efficiency.},

This paper proposes a novel research task of Legal Dispute Judgment (LDJ) prediction for e-commerce transactions, which connects two yet isolated domains, e-commerce data mining and legal intelligence. Different from traditional legal intelligence with the focus on textual evidence of the dispute itself, the new research utilizes multiview information such as past behavior information of seller and buyer as well as textual evidence of the current transaction. The multiview dispute representation is integrated into an innovative multi-task learning framework for predicting the legal result. An extensive set of experiments with a large dispute case dataset collected from a world leading e-commerce platform shows that the proposed model can more accurately characterize a dispute case through buyer, seller, and transaction viewpoints for legal judgment prediction against several alternatives.},

abstract = {Automatic crime classification is a fundamental task in the legal field. Given the fact descriptions, judges first determine the relevant violated laws, and then the articles. As laws and articles are grouped into a tree-shaped hierarchy (i.e., laws as parent labels, articles as children labels), this task can be naturally formalized as a two layers' hierarchical multi-label classification problem. Generally, the label semantics (i.e., definition of articles) and the hierarchical structure are two informative properties for judges to make a correct decision. However, most previous methods usually ignore the label structure and feed all labels into a flat classification framework, or neglect the label semantics and only utilize fact descriptions for crime classification, thus the performance may be limited. In this paper, we formalize crime classification problem into a matching task to address these issues. We name our model as Hierarchical Matching Network (HMN for short). Based on the tree hierarchy, HMN explicitly decomposes the semantics of children labels into the residual and alignment components. The residual components keep the unique characteristics of each individual children label, while the alignment components capture the common semantics among sibling children labels, which are further aggregated as the representation of their parent label. Finally, given a fact description, a co-attention metric is applied to effectively match the relevant laws and articles. Experiments on two real-world judicial datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In fighting against fake news, many fact-checking systems comprised of human-based fact-checking sites (e.g., snopes.com and politifact.com) and automatic detection systems have been developed in recent years. However, online users still keep sharing fake news even when it has been debunked. It means that early fake news detection may be insufficient and we need another complementary approach to mitigate the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of text generation for combating fake news. In particular, we (1) leverage online users named fact-checkers, who cite fact-checking sites as credible evidences to fact-check information in public discourse; (2) analyze linguistic characteristics of fact-checking tweets; and (3) propose and build a deep learning framework to generate responses with fact-checking intention to increase the fact-checkers' engagement in fact-checking activities. Our analysis reveals that the fact-checkers tend to refute misinformation and use formal language (e.g. few swear words and Internet slangs). Our framework successfully generates relevant responses, and outperforms competing models by achieving up to 30% improvements. Our qualitative study also confirms that the superiority of our generated responses compared with responses generated from the existing models.},

abstract = {Session-based recommendation is the task of predicting the next item to recommend when the only available information consists of anonymous behavior sequences. Previous methods for session-based recommendation focus mostly on the current session, ignoring collaborative information in so-called neighborhood sessions, sessions that have been generated previously by other users and reflect similar user intents as the current session. We hypothesize that the collaborative information contained in such neighborhood sessions may help to improve recommendation performance for the current session.We propose a Collaborative Session-based Recommendation Machine (CSRM), a novel hybrid framework to apply collaborative neighborhood information to session-based recommendations. CSRM consists of two parallel modules: an Inner Memory Encoder (IME) and an Outer Memory Encoder (OME). The IME models a user's own information in the current session with the help of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and an attention mechanism. The OME exploits collaborative information to better predict the intent of current sessions by investigating neighborhood sessions. Then, a fusion gating mechanism is used to selectively combine information from the IME and OME so as to obtain the final representation of the current session. Finally, CSRM obtains a recommendation score for each candidate item by computing a bilinear match with the final representation.Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CSRM compared to state-of-the-art session-based recommender systems. Our analysis of CSRM's recommendation process shows when and how collaborative neighborhood information and the fusion gating mechanism positively impact the performance of session-based recommendations.},

In this study, we propose a novel task to dynamically locate the pornographic products from very large product collections. Unlike prior product classification efforts focusing on textual information, the proposed model, BerryPIcking TRee MoDel (BIRD), utilizes both product textual content and buyers' seeking behavior information as berrypicking trees. In particular, the BIRD encodes both semantic information with respect to all branches sequence and the overall latent buyer intent during the whole seeking process. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model against alternative solutions. To facilitate further research of this practical and important problem, the codes and buyers' seeking behavior data have been made publicly available1.},

For example, a person searching information about "cats'' is able to choose query terms, such as "housecat'', "feline'', or "animal'' and avoid terms like "similar'', "variety'', and "distinguish''. We investigated the association between the specificity of terms occurring in documents and human brain activity measured via electroencephalography (EEG). We analyzed the brain activity data of fifteen participants, recorded in response to reading terms from Wikipedia documents. Term specificity was shown to be associated with the amplitude of evoked brain responses. The results indicate that by being able to determine which terms carry maximal information about, and can best discriminate between, documents, people have the capability to enter good query terms. Moreover, our results suggest that the effective query term selection process, often observed in practical search behavior studies, has a neural basis. We believe our findings constitute an important step in revealing the cognitive processing behind query formulation and evaluating informativeness of language in general.},

To identify variable dependency structure between search context and users' ongoing search activities, attention at both levels of recurrent states are introduced. Extensive experiment comparisons against a rich set of baseline methods and an in-depth ablation analysis confirm the value of our proposed approach for modeling search context buried in search tasks.},

abstract = {The query performance prediction (QPP) task is to estimate the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query with no relevance judgments. Existing QPP methods do not account for the effectiveness of a query in representing the underlying information need. We demonstrate the far-reaching implications of this reality using standard TREC-based evaluation of QPP methods: their relative prediction quality patterns vary with respect to the effectiveness of queries used to represent the information needs. Motivated by our findings, we revise the basic probabilistic formulation of the QPP task by accounting for the information need and its connection to the query. We further explore this connection by proposing a novel QPP approach that utilizes information about a set of queries representing the same information need. Predictors instantiated from our approach using a wide variety of existing QPP methods post prediction quality that substantially transcends that of applying these methods, as is standard, using a single query representing the information need. Additional in-depth empirical analysis of different aspects of our approach further attests to the crucial role of query effectiveness in QPP.},

abstract = {People can record their pending tasks using to-do lists, digital assistants, and other task management software. In doing so, users of these systems face at least two challenges: (1) they must manually mark their tasks as complete, and (2) when systems proactively remind them about their pending tasks, say, via interruptive notifications, they lack information on task completion status. As a result, people may not realize the full benefits of to-do lists (since these lists can contain both completed and pending tasks) and they may be reminded about tasks they have already done (wasting time and causing frustration). In this paper, we present methods to automatically detect task completion. These inferences can be used to deprecate completed tasks and/or suppress notifications for these tasks (or for other purposes, e.g., task prioritization). Using log data from a popular digital assistant, we analyze temporal dynamics in the completion of tasks and train machine-learned models to detect completion with accuracy exceeding 80% using a variety of features (time elapsed since task creation, task content, email, notifications, user history). The findings have implications for the design of intelligent systems to help people manage their tasks.},

abstract = {Interactive information retrieval (IIR) researchers often conduct laboratory studies to understand the relationship between people seeking information and information retrieval systems. They develop extensive data collection methods and tools create new understanding about the relationship between observable behaviors, searcher context, and underlying cognition, to better support people's information seeking. Yet aside from the problems of data size, realism, and demographics, laboratory studies are limited in the number and nature of phenomena they can study. Hence, data collected in laboratories contains different searcher populations and collects non-overlapping user and task characteristics. While research analyses and collection methods are isolated, how can we further IIR's mission of broad understanding? We approach this as a structure learning problem on incomplete data, determining the extent to which incomplete data can be used to predict user and task characteristics from interactions. In particular, we examine whether combining heterogeneous data sets is more effective than using a single data set alone in prediction. Our results indicate that adding external data significantly improves predictions of searcher characteristics, task characteristics, and behaviors, even when the data does not contain identical information about searchers.},

abstract = {Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is one of the most challenging tasks in both NLP and IR researches. Recently, a number of deep neural models have been successfully adopted to some simplified MRC task settings, whose performances were close to or even better than human beings. However, these models still have large performance gaps with human beings in more practical settings, such as MS MARCO and DuReader datasets. Although there are many works studying human reading behavior, the behavior patterns in complex reading comprehension scenarios remain under-investigated. We believe that a better understanding of how human reads and allocates their attention during reading comprehension processes can help improve the performance of MRC tasks. In this paper, we conduct a lab study to investigate human's reading behavior patterns during reading comprehension tasks, where 32 users are recruited to take 60 distinct tasks. By analyzing the collected eye-tracking data and answers from participants, we propose a two-stage reading behavior model, in which the first stage is to search for possible answer candidates and the second stage is to generate the final answer through a comparison and verification process. We also find that human's attention distribution is affected by both question-dependent factors (e.g., answer and soft matching signal with questions) and question-independent factors (e.g., position, IDF and Part-of-Speech tags of words). We extract features derived from the two-stage reading behavior model to predict human's attention signals during reading comprehension, which significantly improves performance in the MRC task. Findings in our work may bring insight into the understanding of human reading and information seeking processes, and help the machine to better meet users' information needs.},

abstract = {Generating qualitative responses has always been a challenge for human-computer dialogue systems. Existing dialogue systems generally derive from either retrieval-based or generative-based approaches, both of which have their own pros and cons. Despite the natural idea of an ensemble model of the two, existing ensemble methods only focused on leveraging one approach to enhance another, we argue however that they can be further mutually enhanced with a proper training strategy. In this paper, we propose ensembleGAN, an adversarial learning framework for enhancing a retrieval-generation ensemble model in open-domain conversation scenario. It consists of a language-model-like generator, a ranker generator, and one ranker discriminator. Aiming at generating responses that approximate the ground-truth and receive high ranking scores from the discriminator, the two generators learn to generate improved highly relevant responses and competitive unobserved candidates respectively, while the discriminative ranker is trained to identify true responses from adversarial ones, thus featuring the merits of both generator counterparts. The experimental results on a large short-text conversation data demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensembleGAN by the amelioration on both human and automatic evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {As an intelligent way to interact with computers, the dialog system has been catching more and more attention. However, most research efforts only focus on text-based dialog systems, completely ignoring the rich semantics conveyed by the visual cues. Indeed, the desire for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems is growing with the rapid expansion of many domains, such as the online retailing and travel. Besides, few work considers the hierarchical product taxonomy and the users' attention to products explicitly. The fact is that users tend to express their attention to the semantic attributes of products such as color and style as the dialog goes on. Towards this end, in this work, we present a hierarchical User attention-guided Multimodal Dialog system, named UMD for short. UMD leverages a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network to model the ongoing dialog between users and chatbots at a high level; As to the low level, the multimodal encoder and decoder are capable of encoding multimodal utterances and generating multimodal responses, respectively. The multimodal encoder learns the visual presentation of images with the help of a taxonomy-attribute combined tree, and then the visual features interact with textual features through an attention mechanism; whereas the multimodal decoder selects the required visual images and generates textual responses according to the dialog history. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on a public multimodal dialog dataset in the retailing domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by integrating the multimodal utterances and encoding the visual features based on the users' attribute-level attention.},

abstract = {Knowledge base is one of the main forms to represent information in a structured way. A knowledge base typically consists of Resource Description Frameworks (RDF) triples which describe the entities and their relations. Generating natural language description of the knowledge base is an important task in NLP, which has been formulated as a conditional language generation task and tackled using the sequence-to-sequence framework. Current works mostly train the language models by maximum likelihood estimation, which tends to generate lousy sentences. In this paper, we argue that such a problem of maximum likelihood estimation is intrinsic, which is generally irrevocable via changing network structures. Accordingly, we propose a novel Triple-to-Text (T2T) framework, which approximately optimizes the inverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the distributions of the real and generated sentences. Due to the nature that inverse KL imposes large penalty on fake-looking samples, the proposed method can significantly reduce the probability of generating low-quality sentences. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that T2T can generate higher-quality sentences and outperform baseline models in several evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Video dialog is a new and challenging task, which requires an AI agent to maintain a meaningful dialog with humans in natural language about video contents. Specifically, given a video, a dialog history and a new question about the video, the agent has to combine video information with dialog history to infer the answer. And due to the complexity of video information, the methods of image dialog might be ineffectively applied directly to video dialog. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for video dialog called multi-grained convolutional self-attention context network, which combines video information with dialog history. Instead of using RNN to encode the sequence information, we design a multi-grained convolutional self-attention mechanism to capture both element and segment level interactions which contain multi-grained sequence information. Then, we design a hierarchical dialog history encoder to learn the context-aware question representation and a two-stream video encoder to learn the context-aware video representation. We evaluate our method on two large-scale datasets. Due to the flexibility and parallelism of the new attention mechanism, our method can achieve higher time efficiency, and the extensive experiments also show the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Users often fail to formulate their complex information needs in a single query. As a consequence, they may need to scan multiple result pages or reformulate their queries, which may be a frustrating experience. Alternatively, systems can improve user satisfaction by proactively asking questions of the users to clarify their information needs. Asking clarifying questions is especially important in conversational systems since they can only return a limited number of (often only one) result(s).In this paper, we formulate the task of asking clarifying questions in open-domain information-seeking conversational systems. To this end, we propose an offline evaluation methodology for the task and collect a dataset, called Qulac, through crowdsourcing. Our dataset is built on top of the TREC Web Track 2009-2012 data and consists of over 10K question-answer pairs for 198 TREC topics with 762 facets. Our experiments on an oracle model demonstrate that asking only one good question leads to over 170% retrieval performance improvement in terms of P@1, which clearly demonstrates the potential impact of the task. We further propose a retrieval framework consisting of three components: question retrieval, question selection, and document retrieval. In particular, our question selection model takes into account the original query and previous question-answer interactions while selecting the next question. Our model significantly outperforms competitive baselines. To foster research in this area, we have made Qulac publicly available.},

In this work, we consider algorithmic properties associated with dynamic pruning mechanisms. Such algorithms maintain a score threshold (the k th highest similarity score identified so far) so that low-scoring documents can be bypassed, allowing fast top-k retrieval with no loss in effectiveness. In standard pruning algorithms the score threshold is initialized to the lowest possible value. To accelerate processing, we make use of term- and query-dependent features to predict the final value of that threshold, and then employ the predicted value right from the commencement of processing. Because of the asymmetry associated with prediction errors (if the estimated threshold is too high the query will need to be re-executed in order to assure the correct answer), the prediction process must be risk-sensitive. We explore techniques for balancing those factors, and provide detailed experimental results that show the practical usefulness of the new approach.},

abstract = {A Web crawler is an essential part of a search engine that procures information subsequently served by the search engine to its users. As the Web is becoming increasingly more dynamic, in addition to discovering new web pages a crawler needs to keep revisiting those already in the search engine's index, in order to keep the index fresh by picking up the pages' changed content. Determining how often to recrawl pages requires making tradeoffs based on the pages' relative importance and change rates, subject to multiple resource constraints - the limited daily budget of crawl requests on the search engine's end and politeness constraints restricting the rate at which pages can be requested from a given host. In this paper, we introduce PoliteBinaryLambdaCrawl, the first optimal algorithm for freshness crawl scheduling in the presence of politeness constraints as well as non-uniform page importance scores and the crawler's own crawl request limit. We also propose an approximation for it, stating its theoretical optimality conditions and in the process discovering a connection to an approach previously thought of as a mere heuristic for freshness crawl scheduling. We explore the relative performance of PoliteBinaryLambdaCrawl and other methods for handling politeness constraints on a dataset collected by crawling over 18.5M URLs daily over 14 weeks.},

abstract = {Statistical significance testing is widely accepted as a means to assess how well a difference in effectiveness reflects an actual difference between systems, as opposed to random noise because of the selection of topics. According to recent surveys on SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR and TOIS papers, the t-test is the most popular choice among IR researchers. However, previous work has suggested computer intensive tests like the bootstrap or the permutation test, based mainly on theoretical arguments. On empirical grounds, others have suggested non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test. Indeed, the question of which tests we should use has accompanied IR and related fields for decades now. Previous theoretical studies on this matter were limited in that we know that test assumptions are not met in IR experiments, and empirical studies were limited in that we do not have the necessary control over the null hypotheses to compute actual Type I and Type II error rates under realistic conditions. Therefore, not only is it unclear which test to use, but also how much trust we should put in them. In contrast to past studies, in this paper we employ a recent simulation methodology from TREC data to go around these limitations. Our study comprises over 500 million p-values computed for a range of tests, systems, effectiveness measures, topic set sizes and effect sizes, and for both the 2-tail and 1-tail cases. Having such a large supply of IR evaluation data with full knowledge of the null hypotheses, we are finally in a position to evaluate how well statistical significance tests really behave with IR data, and make sound recommendations for practitioners.},

abstract = {Social e-commerce, as a new concept of e-commerce, uses social media as a new prevalent platform for online shopping. Users are now able to view, add to cart, and buy products within a single social media app. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-platform recommendation for social e-commerce, i.e., recommending products to users when they are shopping through social media. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new and important problem for all e-commerce companies (e.g. Amazon, Alibaba), but has never been studied before.Existing cross-platform and social related recommendation methods cannot be applied directly for this problem since they do not co-consider the social information and the cross-platform characteristics together. To study this problem, we first investigate the heterogeneous shopping behaviors between traditional e-commerce app and social media. Based on these observations from data, we propose CROSS (Cross-platform Recommendation for Online Shopping in Social Media), a recommendation model utilizing not only user-item interaction data on both platforms, but also social relation data on social media. Extensive experiments on real-world online shopping dataset demonstrate that our proposed CROSS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Social media users create millions of microblog entries on various topics each day. Retweet behaviour play a crucial role in spreading topics on social media. Retweet prediction task has received considerable attention in recent years. The majority of existing retweet prediction methods are focus on modeling user preference by utilizing various information, such as user profiles, user post history, user following relationships, etc. Yet, the users exposures towards real-time posting from their followees contribute significantly to making retweet predictions, considering that the users may participate into the hot topics discussed by their followees rather than be limited to their previous interests. To make efficient use of hot topics, we propose a novel masked self-attentive model to perform the retweet prediction task by perceiving the hot topics discussed by the users' followees. We incorporate the posting histories of users with external memory and utilize a hierarchical attention mechanism to construct the users' interests. Hence, our model can be jointly hot-topic aware and user interests aware to make a final prediction. Experimental results on a dataset collected from Twitter demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In Twitter-like social networking services, the "@'' symbol can be used with the tweet to mention users whom the user wants to alert regarding the message. An automatic suggestion to the user of a small list of candidate names can improve communication efficiency. Previous work usually used several most recent tweets or randomly select historical tweets to make an inference about this preferred list of names. However, because there are too many historical tweets by users and a wide variety of content types, the use of several tweets cannot guarantee the desired results. In this work, we propose the use of a novel cooperative multi-agent approach to mention recommendation, which incorporates dozens of more historical tweets than earlier approaches. The proposed method can effectively select a small set of historical tweets and cooperatively extract relevant indicator tweets from both the user and mentioned users. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Accurate user representation learning has been proven fundamental for many social media applications, including community detection, recommendation, etc. A major challenge lies in that, the available data in a single social network are usually very limited and sparse. In real life, many people are members of several social networks in the same time. Constrained by the features and design of each, any single social platform offers only a partial view of a user from a particular perspective. In this paper, we propose MV-URL, a multi-view user representation learning model to enhance user modeling by integrating the knowledge from various networks. Different from the traditional network embedding frameworks where either the whole framework is single-network based or each network involved is a homogeneous network, we focus on multiple social networks and each network in our task is a heterogeneous network. It's very challenging to effectively fuse knowledge in this setting as the fusion depends upon not only the varying relatedness of information sources, but also the target application tasks. MV-URL focuses on two tasks: user account linkage (i.e., to predict the missing true user account linkage across social media) and user attribute prediction. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on two real-world collections of linked social networks, and the experimental results show the superiority of MV-URL compared with existing state-of-art embedding methods. It can be learned online, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for real world applications.},

abstract = {Personalized search aims to adapt document ranking to user's personal interests. Traditionally, this is done by extracting click and topical features from historical data in order to construct a user profile. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully used in personalized search due to its ability of automatic feature learning. However, the small amount of noisy personal data poses challenges to deep learning models to learn the personalized classification boundary between relevant and irrelevant results. In this paper, we propose PSGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for personalized search. By means of adversarial training, we enforce the model to pay more attention to training data that are difficult to distinguish. We use the discriminator to evaluate personalized relevance of documents and use the generator to learn the distribution of relevant documents. Two alternative ways to construct the generator in the framework are tested: based on the current query or based on a set of generated queries. Experiments on data from a commercial search engine show that our models can yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {User response prediction, which models the user preference w.r.t. the presented items, plays a key role in online services. With two-decade rapid development, nowadays the cumulated user behavior sequences on mature Internet service platforms have become extremely long since the user's first registration. Each user not only has intrinsic tastes, but also keeps changing her personal interests during lifetime. Hence, it is challenging to handle such lifelong sequential modeling for each individual user. Existing methodologies for sequential modeling are only capable of dealing with relatively recent user behaviors, which leaves huge space for modeling long-term especially lifelong sequential patterns to facilitate user modeling. Moreover, one user's behavior may be accounted for various previous behaviors within her whole online activity history, i.e., long-term dependency with multi-scale sequential patterns. In order to tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Periodic Memory Network for lifelong sequential modeling with personalized memorization of sequential patterns for each user. The model also adopts a hierarchical and periodical updating mechanism to capture multi-scale sequential patterns of user interests while supporting the evolving user behavior logs. The experimental results over three large-scale real-world datasets have demonstrated the advantages of our proposed model with significant improvement in user response prediction performance against the state-of-the-arts.},

abstract = {Synonym expansion is a technique that adds related words to search queries, which may lead to more relevant documents being retrieved, thus improving recall. There is extensive prior work on synonym expansion for web search, however very few studies have tackled its application for email search. Synonym expansion for private corpora like emails poses several unique research challenges. First, the emails are not shared across users, which precludes us from directly employing query-document bipartite graphs, which are standard in web search synonym expansion. Second, user search queries are of personal nature, and may not be generalizable across users. Third, the size of the underlying corpora from which the synonyms may be mined is relatively small (i.e., user's private email inbox) compared to the size of the web corpus. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a solution tailored to the challenges of synonym expansion for email search. We formulate it as a multi-view learning problem, and propose a novel embedding-based model that joins information from multiple sources to obtain the optimal synonym candidates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we evaluate our model using both explicit human ratings as well as a live experiment using the Gmail Search service, one of the world's largest email search engines.},

In this work, we focus on sentence-level intent identification and study how incorporating more context (such as the full message body and other metadata) could improve the performance of the intent identification models. We experiment with several models for leveraging context including both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches. We show that modeling the interaction between sentence and context can significantly improve the performance.},

abstract = {This study evaluates 30 IR evaluation measures or their instances, of which nine are for adhoc IR and 21 are for diversified IR, primarily from the viewpoint of whether their preferences of one SERP (search engine result page) over another actually align with users' preferences. The gold preferences were contructed by hiring 15 assessors, who independently examined 1,127 SERP pairs and made preference assessments. Two sets of preference assessments were obtained: one based on a relevance question "Which SERP is more relevant?'' and the other based on a diversity question "Which SERP is likely to satisfy a higher number of users?'' To our knowledge, our study is the first to have collected diversity preference assessments in this way and evaluated diversity measures successfully. Our main results are that (a) Popular adhoc IR measures such as nDCG actually align quite well with the gold relevance preferences; and that (b) While the ♯-measures align well with the gold diversity preferences, intent-aware measures perform relatively poorly. Moreover, as by-products of our analysis of existing evaluation measures, we define new adhoc measures called iRBU (intentwise Rank-Biased Utility) and EBR (Expected Blended Ratio); we demonstrate that an instance of iRBU performs as well as nDCG when compared to the gold relevance preferences. On the other hand, the original RBU, a recently-proposed diversity measure, underperforms the best ♯-measures when compared to the gold diversity preferences.},

abstract = {The understanding of the process of relevance judgment helps to inspire the design of retrieval models. Traditional retrieval models usually estimate relevance based on document-level signals. Recent works consider a more fine-grain, passage-level relevance information, which can further enhance retrieval performance. However, it lacks a detailed analysis of how passage-level relevance signals determine or influence the relevance judgment of the whole document. To investigate the role of passage-level relevance in the document-level relevance judgment, we construct an ad-hoc retrieval dataset with both passage-level and document-level relevance labels. A thorough analysis reveals that: 1) there is a strong correlation between the document-level relevance and the fractions of irrelevant passages to highly relevant passages; 2) the position, length and query similarity of passages play different roles in the determination of document-level relevance; 3) The sequential passage-level relevance within a document is a potential indicator for the document-level relevance. Based on the relationship between passage-level and document-level relevance, we also show that utilizing passage-level relevance signals can improve existing document ranking models. This study helps us better understand how users perceive relevance for a document and inspire the designing of novel ranking models leveraging fine-grain, passage-level relevance signals.},

But unprocessed archival collections can't be made available for search if they contain sensitive content that needs to be protected. Traditionally, content if first examined through a sensitivity review process, which becomes more difficult and time-consuming as content volumes increase. To mitigate these costs and delays, search technology should be capable of providing access to relevant content while protecting sensitive content. This paper proposes an approach that leverages learning to rank techniques. We use learning to rank to optimize a loss function that balances the value of finding relevant content with the imperative to protect sensitive content. In the experiments, a LETOR benchmark dataset, OHSUMED, is used with a subset of the MeSH labels representing the sensitive documents. Results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in comparison with some simpler baselines.},

abstract = {Traditional online quality metrics are based on search and browsing signals, such as position and time of the click. Such metrics typically model all users' behavior in exactly the same manner. Modeling individuals' behavior in Web search may be challenging as the user's historical behavior may not always be available (e.g., if the user is not signed into a given service). However, in personal search, individual users issue queries over their personal corpus (e.g. emails, files, etc.) while they are logged into the service. This brings an opportunity to calibrate online quality metrics with respect to an individual's search habits. With this goal in mind, the current paper focuses on a user-centric evaluation framework for personal search by taking into account variability of search and browsing behavior across individuals. The main idea is to calibrate each interaction of a user with respect to their historical behavior and search habits. To formalize this, a characterization of online metrics is proposed according to the relevance signal of interest and how the signal contributes to the computation of the gain in a metric. The proposed framework introduces a variant of online metrics called pMetrics (short for personalized metrics) that are based on the average search habits of users for the relevance signal of interest. Through extensive online experiments on a large population of GMail search users, we show that pMetrics are effective in terms of their sensitivity, robustness, and stability compared to their standard variants as well as baselines with different normalization factors.},

abstract = {Cross-modal retrieval takes one type of data as the query to retrieve relevant data of another type. Most of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches were proposed to learn a common subspace in a joint manner, where the data from all modalities have to be involved during the whole training process. For these approaches, the optimal parameters of different modality-specific transformations are dependent on each other and the whole model has to be retrained when handling samples from new modalities. In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal retrieval method, called Scalable Deep Multimodal Learning (SDML). It proposes to predefine a common subspace, in which the between-class variation is maximized while the within-class variation is minimized. Then, it trains m modality-specific networks for m modalities (one network for each modality) to transform the multimodal data into the predefined common subspace to achieve multimodal learning. Unlike many of the existing methods, our method can train different modality-specific networks independently and thus be scalable to the number of modalities. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed SDML could be one of the first works to independently project data of an unfixed number of modalities into a predefined common subspace. Comprehensive experimental results on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient in multimodal learning and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in cross-modal retrieval.},

abstract = {We propose a neural network model to estimate word translation probabilities for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). The model estimates better probabilities for word translations than automatic word alignments alone, and generalizes to unseen source-target word pairs. We further improve the lexical neural translation model (and subsequently CLIR), by incorporating source word context, and by encoding the character sequences of input source words to generate translations of out-of-vocabulary words. To be effective, neural network models typically need training on large amounts of data labeled directly on the final task, in this case relevance to queries. In contrast, our approach only requires parallel data to train the translation model, and uses an unsupervised model to compute CLIR relevance scores.We report results on the retrieval of text and speech documents from three morphologically complex languages with limited training data resources (Swahili, Tagalog, and Somali) and short English queries. Despite training on only about 2M words of parallel training data for each language, we obtain neural network translation models that are very effective for this task. We also obtain further improvements using (i) a modified relevance model, which uses the probability of occurrence of a translation of each query term in the source document, and (ii) confusion networks (instead of 1-best output) that encode multiple transcription alternatives in the output of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.We achieve overall MAP relative improvements of up to 24% on Swahili, 50% on Tagalog, and 39% on Somali over the baseline probabilistic model, and larger improvements over monolingual retrieval from machine translation output.},

abstract = {Query-based moment retrieval aims to localize the most relevant moment in an untrimmed video according to the given natural language query. Existing works often only focus on one aspect of this emerging task, such as the query representation learning, video context modeling or multi-modal fusion, thus fail to develop a comprehensive system for further performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel Cross-Modal Interaction Network (CMIN) to consider multiple crucial factors for this challenging task, including (1) the syntactic structure of natural language queries; (2) long-range semantic dependencies in video context and (3) the sufficient cross-modal interaction. Specifically, we devise a syntactic GCN to leverage the syntactic structure of queries for fine-grained representation learning, propose a multi-head self-attention to capture long-range semantic dependencies from video context, and next employ a multi-stage cross-modal interaction to explore the potential relations of video and query contents. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Factorization Machines (FMs) are widely used for feature-based collaborative filtering tasks, as they are very effective at modeling feature interactions. Existing FM-based methods usually take all feature interactions into account, which is unreasonable because not all feature interactions are helpful: incorporating useless feature interactions will introduce noise and degrade the recommendation performance. Recently, methods that perform Feature Interaction Selection (FIS) have attracted attention because of their effectiveness at filtering out useless feature interactions. However, they assume that all users share the same feature interactions, which is not necessarily true, especially for collaborative filtering tasks. In this work, we address this issue and study Personalized Feature Interaction Selection (P-FIS) by proposing a Bayesian Personalized Feature Interaction Selection (BP-FIS) mechanism under the Bayesian Variable Selection (BVS) theory. Specifically, we first introduce interaction selection variables with hereditary spike and slab priors for P-FIS. Then, we form a Bayesian generative model and derive the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), which can be optimized by an efficient Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) method to learn the parameters. Finally, because BP-FIS can be seamlessly integrated with different variants of FMs, we implement two FM variants under the proposed BP-FIS. We carry out experiments on three benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of BP-FIS for selecting personalized interactions and improving the recommendation performance.},

abstract = {In e-commerce, users' demands are not only conditioned by their profile and preferences, but also by their recent purchases that may generate new demands, as well as periodical demands that depend on purchases made some time ago. We call them respectively short-term demands and long-term demands. In this paper, we propose a novel self-attentive Continuous-Time Recommendation model (CTRec) for capturing the evolving demands of users over time. For modeling such time-sensitive demands, a Demand-aware Hawkes Process (DHP) framework is designed in CTRec to learn from the discrete purchase records of users. More specifically, a convolutional neural network is utilized to capture the short-term demands; and a self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the periodical purchase cycles of long-term demands. All types of demands are fused in DHP to make final continuous-time recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world commercial datasets to demonstrate that CTRec is effective for general sequential recommendation problems, including next-item and next-session/basket recommendations. We observe in particular that CTRec is capable of learning the purchase cycles of products and estimating the purchase time of a product given a user.},

abstract = {Sequential Recommendation (SR) is the task of recommending the next item based on a sequence of recorded user behaviors. We study SR in a particularly challenging context, in which multiple individual users share a single account (shared-account) and in which user behaviors are available in multiple domains (cross-domain). These characteristics bring new challenges on top of those of the traditional SR task. On the one hand, we need to identify different user behaviors under the same account in order to recommend the right item to the right user at the right time. On the other hand, we need to discriminate the behaviors from one domain that might be helpful to improve recommendations in the other domains.We formulate the Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (SCSR) task as a parallel sequential recommendation problem. We propose a Parallel Information-sharing Network (π-Net) to simultaneously generate recommendations for two domains where user behaviors on two domains are synchronously shared at each timestamp. π-Net contains two core units: a shared account filter unit (SFU) and a cross-domain transfer unit (CTU). The SFU is used to address the challenge raised by shared accounts; it learns user-specific representations, and uses a gating mechanism to filter out information of some users that might be useful for another domain. The CTU is used to address the challenge raised by the cross-domain setting; it adaptively combines the information from the SFU at each timestamp and then transfers it to another domain. After that, π-Net estimates recommendation scores for each item in two domains by integrating information from both domains.To assess the effectiveness of π-Net, we construct a new dataset HVIDEO from real-world smart TV watching logs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset with both shared-account and cross-domain characteristics. We release HVIDEO to facilitate future research. Our experimental results demonstrate that π-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of MRR and Recall.},

abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction has been one of the most central problems in computational advertising. Lately, embedding techniques that produce low-dimensional representations of ad IDs drastically improve CTR prediction accuracies. However, such learning techniques are data demanding and work poorly on new ads with little logging data, which is known as the cold-start problem.In this paper, we aim to improve CTR predictions during both the cold-start phase and the warm-up phase when a new ad is added to the candidate pool. We propose Meta-Embedding, a meta-learning-based approach that learns to generate desirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs. The proposed method trains an embedding generator for new ad IDs by making use of previously learned ads through gradient-based meta-learning. In other words, our method learns how to learn better embeddings. When a new ad comes, the trained generator initializes the embedding of its ID by feeding its contents and attributes. Next, the generated embedding can speed up the model fitting during the warm-up phase when a few labeled examples are available, compared to the existing initialization methods.Experimental results on three real-world datasets showed that Meta-Embedding can significantly improve both the cold-start and warm-up performances for six existing CTR prediction models, ranging from lightweight models such as Factorization Machines to complicated deep models such as PNN and DeepFM. All of the above apply to conversion rate (CVR) predictions as well.},

abstract = {Online news streaming services have been one of the major information acquisition resources for mobile users. In many cases, users click an article but find it cannot satisfy or even annoy them. Intuitively, these negative experiences will affect users' behaviors and satisfaction, but such effects have not been well understood. In this work, a retrospective analysis is conducted using real users' log data, containing user's explicit feedback of negative experiences, from a commercial news streaming application. Through multiple intra-session comparison experiments, we find that in current session, users will spend less time reading the content, lose activeness and leave sooner after having negative experiences. Later return and significant changes of user behaviors in the next session are also observed, which demonstrates the existence of inter-session effects of negative experiences.Since users' negative experiences are generally implicit, we further investigate the possibility and the approach to automatically identify them. Results show that using changes of both users' intra-session and inter-session behaviors achieves significant improvement. Besides the effects on user behaviors, we also explore the effects on user satisfaction by incorporating a laboratory user study. Results show that negative experiences reduce user satisfaction in the current session, and the impact will last to the next session. Moreover, we demonstrate users' negative feedback helps on the meta-evaluation of online metrics. Our research has comprehensively analyzed the impacts of users' item-level negative experiences, and shed light on the understanding of user behaviors and satisfaction.},

abstract = {Multi-modal hashing is an effective technique to support large-scale multimedia retrieval, due to its capability of encoding heterogeneous multi-modal features into compact and similarity-preserving binary codes. Although great progress has been achieved so far, existing methods still suffer from several problems, including: 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods, which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically, a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability, while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework, the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly, our method can benefit from the semantic labels, and simultaneously, avoid the high computation complexity. Moreover, to accurately capture the query variations, at the online retrieval stage, we design a parameter-free online hashing module which can adaptively learn the query hash codes according to the dynamic query contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach from various aspects.},

abstract = {Recently, due to the unprecedented growth of multimedia data, cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention for the efficient cross-media retrieval. Typically, existing methods on cross-modal hashing treat labels of one instance independently but overlook the correlations among labels. Indeed, in many real-world scenarios, like the online fashion domain, instances (items) are labeled with a set of categories correlated by certain hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end solution for supervised cross-modal hashing, named HiCHNet, which explicitly exploits the hierarchical labels of instances. In particular, by the pre-established label hierarchy, we comprehensively characterize each modality of the instance with a set of layer-wise hash representations. In essence, hash codes are encouraged to not only preserve the layer-wise semantic similarities encoded by the label hierarchy, but also retain the hierarchical discriminative capabilities. Due to the lack of benchmark datasets, apart from adapting the existing dataset FashionVC from fashion domain, we create a dataset from the online fashion platform Ssense consisting of 15,696 image-text pairs labeled by 32 hierarchical categories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Fast similarity search is a key component in large-scale information retrieval, where semantic hashing has become a popular strategy for representing documents as binary hash codes. Recent advances in this area have been obtained through neural network based models: generative models trained by learning to reconstruct the original documents. We present a novel unsupervised generative semantic hashing approach, Ranking based Semantic Hashing (RBSH) that consists of both a variational and a ranking based component. Similarly to variational autoencoders, the variational component is trained to reconstruct the original document conditioned on its generated hash code, and as in prior work, it only considers documents individually. The ranking component solves this limitation by incorporating inter-document similarity into the hash code generation, modelling document ranking through a hinge loss. To circumvent the need for labelled data to compute the hinge loss, we use a weak labeller and thus keep the approach fully unsupervised.Extensive experimental evaluation on four publicly available datasets against traditional baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods for semantic hashing shows that RBSH significantly outperforms all other methods across all evaluated hash code lengths. In fact, RBSH hash codes are able to perform similarly to state-of-the-art hash codes while using 2-4x fewer bits.},

Without loss of generality, the OG task can be viewed as a novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task. Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways. First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and eliminate duplication between section headings. Besides, we build a novel Wriptsize IKI OG dataset, a public collection which consists of over 1.75 million document-outline pairs for research on the OG task. Experimental results on our benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art sequential generation models for the OG task.},

Specifically, given a document, a word graph is constructed from the document based on word proximity and is encoded with graph convolutional networks, which effectively capture document-level word salience by modeling long-range dependency between words in the document and aggregating multiple appearances of identical words into one node. Furthermore, we propose a diversified point network to generate a set of diverse keyphrases out of the word graph in the decoding process. Experimental results on five benchmark data sets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Fashion recommendation has attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture for fashion recommendation based on both image region-level features and user review information. Our basic intuition is that: for a fashion image, not all the regions are equally important for the users, i.e., people usually care about a few parts of the fashion image. To model such human sense, we learn an attention model over many pre-segmented image regions, based on which we can understand where a user is really interested in on the image, and correspondingly, represent the image in a more accurate manner. In addition, by discovering such fine-grained visual preference, we can visually explain a recommendation by highlighting some regions of its image. For better learning the attention model, we also introduce user review information as a weak supervision signal to collect more comprehensive user preference. In our final framework, the visual and textual features are seamlessly coupled by a multimodal attention network. Based on this architecture, we can not only provide accurate recommendation, but also can accompany each recommended item with novel visual explanations. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in terms of Top-N recommendation, and also we build a collectively labeled dataset for evaluating our provided visual explanations in a quantitative manner.},

Existing methods have primarily utilized the visual content to learn the visual compatibility and performed matching in a latent space. Despite their effectiveness, these methods work like a black box and cannot reveal the reasons that two items match well. The rich attributes associated with fashion items, e.g.,off-shoulder dress and black skinny jean, which describe the semantics of items in a human-interpretable way, have largely been ignored.This work tackles the interpretable fashion matching task, aiming to inject interpretability into the compatibility modeling of items. Specifically, given a corpus of matched pairs of items, we not only can predict the compatibility score of unseen pairs, but also learn the interpretable patterns that lead to a good match, e.g., white T-shirt matches with black trouser. We propose a new solution named A ttribute-based I nterpretable C ompatibility (AIC) method, which consists of three modules: 1) a tree-based module that extracts decision rules on matching prediction; 2) an embedding module that learns vector representation for a rule by accounting for the attribute semantics; and 3) a joint modeling module that unifies the visual embedding and rule embedding to predict the matching score. To justify our proposal, we contribute a new Lookastic dataset with fashion attributes available. Extensive experiments show that AIC not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides good interpretability on matching decisions.},

abstract = {Recently, as an essential part of people's daily life, clothing matching has gained increasing research attention. Most existing efforts focus on the numerical compatibility modeling between fashion items with advanced neural networks, and hence suffer from the poor interpretation, which makes them less applicable in real world applications. In fact, people prefer to know not only whether the given fashion items are compatible, but also the reasonable interpretations as well as suggestions regarding how to make the incompatible outfit harmonious. Considering that the research line of the comprehensively interpretable clothing matching is largely untapped, in this work, we propose a prototype-guided attribute-wise interpretable compatibility modeling (PAICM) scheme, which seamlessly integrates the latent compatible/incompatible prototype learning and compatibility modeling with the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) framework. In particular, the latent attribute interaction prototypes, learned by the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), are treated as templates to interpret the discordant attribute and suggest the alternative item for each fashion item pair. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of our scheme.},

abstract = {Retrieval models aim to estimate the relevance of a document to a certain query. Although existing retrieval models have gained much success in both deepening our understanding of information seeking behavior and constructing practical retrieval systems (e.g. Web search engines), we have to admit that the models work in a rather different manner than how humans make relevance judgments. In this paper, we aim to reexamine the existing models as well as to propose new ones based on the findings in how human read documents during relevance judgment. First, we summarize a number of reading heuristics from practical user behavior patterns, which are categorized into implicit and explicit heuristics. By reviewing a variety of existing retrieval models, we find that most of them only satisfy a part of these reading heuristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of each heuristic, we conduct an ablation study and find that most heuristics have positive impacts on retrieval performance. We further integrate all the effective heuristics into a new retrieval model named Reading Inspired Model (RIM). Specifically, implicit reading heuristics are incorporated into the model framework and explicit reading heuristics are modeled as a Markov Decision Process and learned by reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale public available benchmark dataset and two test sets from NTCIR WWW tasks show that RIM outperforms most existing models, which illustrates the effectiveness of the reading heuristics. We believe that this work contributes to constructing retrieval models with both higher retrieval performance and better explainability.},

abstract = {Several Web search services enable their users with the possibility of sorting the list of results by a specific attribute, e.g., sort "by price" in e-commerce. However, sorting the results by attribute could bring marginally relevant results in the top positions thus leading to a poor user experience. This motivates the definition of the relevance-aware filtering problem. This problem asks to remove results from the attribute-sorted list to maximize its final overall relevance. Recently, an optimal solution to this problem has been proposed. However, it has strong limitations in the Web scenario due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose ϵ-Filtering: an efficient approximate algorithm with strong approximation guarantees on the relevance of the final list. More precisely, given an allowed approximation error ϵ, the proposed algorithm finds a(1-ϵ)"optimal filtering, i.e., the relevance of its solution is at least (1-ϵ) times the optimum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ϵ-Filtering against state-of-the-art competitors on two real-world public datasets. Experiments show that ϵ-Filtering achieves the desired levels of effectiveness with a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude with respect to the optimal solution while guaranteeing very small approximation errors.},

Unfortunately, existing examination-bias estimators are limited to the Position-Based Model (PBM), where the examination bias may only depend on the rank of the document. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Contextual Position-Based Model (CPBM) where the examination bias may also depend on a context vector describing the query and the user. Furthermore, we propose an effective estimator for the CPBM based on intervention harvesting. A key feature of the estimator is that it does not require disruptive interventions but merely exploits natural variation resulting from the use of multiple historic ranking functions. Real-world experiments on the ArXiv search engine and semi-synthetic experiments on the Yahoo Learning-To-Rank dataset demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of the new approach.},

abstract = {Online Learning to Rank (OL2R) algorithms learn from implicit user feedback on the fly. The key to such algorithms is an unbiased estimate of gradients, which is often (trivially) achieved by uniformly sampling from the entire parameter space. Unfortunately, this leads to high-variance in gradient estimation, resulting in high regret during model updates, especially when the dimension of the parameter space is large.In this work, we aim at reducing the variance of gradient estimation in OL2R algorithms. We project the selected updating direction (i.e., the winning direction) into a space spanned by the feature vectors from examined documents under the current query (termed the "document space" for short), after an interleaved test. Our key insight is that the result of an interleaved test is solely governed by a user's relevance evaluation over the examined documents. Hence, the true gradient introduced by this test is only reflected in the constructed document space, and components of the proposed gradient which are orthogonal to the document space can be safely removed, for variance reduction purpose. We prove that this projected gradient is still an unbiased estimation of the true gradient, and show that this lower-variance gradient estimation results in significant regret reduction. Our proposed method is compatible with all existing OL2R algorithms which rank documents using a linear model. Extensive experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art OL2R algorithms have confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing the variance of gradient estimation and improving overall ranking performance.},

abstract = {The limited availability of ground truth relevance labels has been a major impediment to the application of supervised methods to ad-hoc retrieval. As a result, unsupervised scoring methods, such as BM25, remain strong competitors to deep learning techniques which have brought on dramatic improvements in other domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Recent works have shown that it is possible to take advantage of the performance of these unsupervised methods to generate training data for learning-to-rank models. The key limitation to this line of work is the size of the training set required to surpass the performance of the original unsupervised method, which can be as large as 1013 training examples. Building on these insights, we propose two methods to reduce the amount of training data required. The first method takes inspiration from crowdsourcing, and leverages multiple unsupervised rankers to generate soft, or noise-aware, training labels. The second identifies harmful, or mislabeled, training examples and removes them from the training set. We show that our methods allow us to surpass the performance of the unsupervised baseline with far fewer training examples than previous works.},

There are, however, no network embedding approaches designed for dynamic heterogeneous networks so far. Addressing this research gap is beneficial for analyzing and mining real world networks. We develop a novel representation learning method, change2vec, which considers a dynamic heterogeneous network as snapshots of networks with different time stamps. Instead of processing the whole network at each time stamp, change2vec models changes between two consecutive static networks by capturing newly-added and deleted nodes with their neighbour nodes as well as newly-formed or deleted edges that caused core structural changes known as triad closure or open processes. Change2vec leverages metapath based node embedding and change modeling to preserve both heterogeneous and dynamic features of a network. Experimental results show that change2vec outperforms two state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance and efficiency.},

To solve this problem, we introduce a retrieval-based framework hybridized with a semantic inference model which helps to achieve robust retrieval results. Our model relies on fine-designed features extracted from the context of candidate triggers. We collect two story dubbing datasets through crowdsourcing to analyze the setting of adding sound effects and to train and test our proposed methods. We further discuss the importance of each feature and introduce several heuristic rules for the trade-off between precision and recall. Together with the text-to-speech technology, our results reveal a promising automatic pipeline on producing high-quality radio stories.},

The proposed method preserves the hierarchical relations by leveraging the non-linearity of hyperbolic vector translations, for which the edge attributes are exploited to capture the importance of each relation fact.

abstract = {Effectively modeling and predicting the information cascades is at the core of understanding the information diffusion, which is essential for many related downstream applications, such as fake news detection and viral marketing identification. Conventional methods for cascade prediction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models and hand-crafted features. Owing to the significant recent successes of deep learning in multiple domains, attempts have been made to predict cascades by developing neural networks based approaches. However, the existing models are not capable of capturing both the underlying structure of a cascade graph and the node sequence in the diffusion process which, in turn, results in unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task learning framework with a novel design of shared-representation layer to aid in explicitly understanding and predicting the cascades. As it turns out, the learned latent representation from the shared-representation layer can encode the structure and the node sequence of the cascade very well.

This is particularly relevant for the highly volatile bitcoin price with its distinct four phases across 2017-18. We statistically test which words change in frequency between the different stages and compare four word2vec models to assess their consistency in relating connected words in weighted, undirected graphs. For words that fall in frequency when prices shift from rising to falling, all eight topics are identified with the four approaches; for words rising in frequency, three out of the five topics remain constant. These topics are intuitive and match with actual events in the news.},

To differentiate fake news from genuine news, one can compare a recent news with earlier posted ones. Identified suspicious news can be debunked to stop the fake news from spreading further. In this paper, we investigate the advantages of recurrent neural networks-based language representations (e.g., BERT, BiLSTM) in order to build ensemble classifiers that can accurately predict if one news title is related to, and, additionally disagrees with an earlier news title. Our experiments, on a dataset of 321k news titles created for the WSDM 2019 challenge, show that the BERT-based models significantly outperform BiLSTM, which in-turn significantly outperforms a simpler embedding-based representation. Furthermore, even the state-of-the-art BERT approach can be enhanced when combined with a simple BM25 feature.},

We conducted a user study with 60 participants where we investigated the impact of time limits (15, 30, and 60 seconds) and document size (full length vs. short summaries) on relevance assessing. Participants were shown either full documents or document summaries that they had to judge within a 15, 30, or 60 seconds time constraint per document. We found that using a time limit as short as 15 seconds or judging document summaries in place of full documents could significantly speed judging without significantly affecting judging quality. Participants found judging document summaries with a 60 second time limit to be the easiest and best experience of the six conditions. While time limits may speed judging, the same speed benefits can be had with high quality document summaries while providing an improved judging experience for assessors.},

This paper proposes a dual-stream learning framework, dubbed Deep Collaborative Discrete Hashing (DCDH), which constructs a discriminative common discrete space by collaboratively incorporating the shared and individual semantics deduced from visual features and semantic labels. Specifically, the context-aware representations are generated by employing the outer product of visual embeddings and semantic encodings. Moreover, we reconstruct the labels and introduce the focal loss to take advantage of frequent and rare concepts. The common binary code space is built on the joint learning of the visual representations attended by language, the semantic-invariant structure construction and the label distribution correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

abstract = {To represent a complex network, paths are often employed for capturing relationships among node: random walks for (homogeneous) networks and metapaths for heterogeneous information networks (HINs). However, there is structural (and possibly semantic) information loss when using paths to represent the subgraph between two nodes, since a path is a linear structure and a subgraph often is not. Can we find a better alternative for network embeddings? We offer a novel mechanism to capture the features of HIN nodes via metagraphs, which retains more structural and semantic information than path-oriented models. Inspired by developments in knowledge graph embedding, we propose to construct HIN triplets using nodes and metagraphs between them. Metagraphs are generated by harnessing the GRAMI algorithm, which enumerates frequent subgraph patterns in a HIN. Subsequently, the Hadamard function is applied to encode relationships between nodes and metagraphs, and the probability whether a HIN triplet can be evaluated. Further, to better distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric cases of metagraphs, we introduce a complex embedding scheme that is able to precisely express fine-grained features of HIN nodes. We evaluate the proposed model, M-HIN, on real-life datasets and demonstrate that it significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based methods for Collaborative Filtering (CF) demonstrate remarkable performance for one-class (implicit negative) recommendation tasks by extending autoencoders with relaxed but tractable latent distributions. Explicitly modeling a latent distribution over user preferences allows VAEs to learn user and item representations that not only reproduce observed interactions, but also generalize them by leveraging learning from similar users and items. Unfortunately, VAE-CF can exhibit suboptimal learning properties; e.g., VAE-CFs will increase their prediction confidence as they receive more preferences per user, even when those preferences may vary widely and create ambiguity in the user representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Queryable Variational Autoencoder (Q-VAE) variant of the VAE that explicitly models arbitrary conditional relationships between observations. The proposed model appropriately increases uncertainty (rather than reduces it) in cases where a large number of user preferences may lead to an ambiguous user representation. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the Q-VAE generally performs comparably or outperforms VAE-based recommenders as well as other state-of-the-art approaches and is generally competitive across the user preference density spectrum, where other methods peak for certain preference density levels.},

Over recent years, the paradigm has been widely adopted in several domains including personal email search, e-commerce, and music search. However, the topic of evaluation and metrics of such systems has been less explored in the literature thus far. In this work, we describe a mixed methods approach to understanding user expectations and evaluating an instant search system in the context of music search. Our methodology involves conducting a set of user interviews to gain a qualitative understanding of users' behaviors and their expectations. The hypotheses from user research are then extended and verified by a large-scale quantitative analysis of interaction logs. Using music search as a lens, we show that researchers and practitioners can interpret the behavior logs more effectively when accompanied by insights from qualitative research. Further, we also show that user research eliminates the guesswork involved in identifying users signals that estimate user satisfaction. Finally, we demonstrate that metrics identified using our approach are more sensitive than the commonly used click-through rate metric for instant search.},

We present experimental results showing that models that effectively combine both query-question and query-answer representations using attention mechanisms in a hierarchical manner yield the best results from all proposed models. We further verify the effectiveness of attention mechanisms for FAQ Retrieval by conducting experiments on a completely different attention-based architecture, originally designed for question duplicate detection tasks, and observing equally impressive experimental ranking results.},

abstract = {User preferences in the form of absolute feedback, s.a., ratings, are widely exploited in Recommender Systems (RSs). Recent research has explored the usage of preferences expressed with pairwise comparisons, which signal relative feedback. It has been shown that pairwise comparisons can be effectively combined with ratings, but, it is important to fine tune the technique that leverages both types of feedback. Previous approaches train a single model by converting ratings into pairwise comparisons, and then use only that type of data. However, we claim that these two types of preferences reveal different information about users interests and should be exploited differently. Hence, in this work, we develop a ranking technique that separately exploits absolute and relative preferences in a hybrid model. In particular, we propose a joint loss function which is computed on both absolute and relative preferences of users. Our proposed ranking model uses pairwise comparisons data to predict the user's preference order between pairs of items and uses ratings to push high rated (relevant) items to the top of the ranking. Experimental results on three different data sets demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms competitive baseline algorithms on popular ranking-oriented evaluation metrics.},

The results of their processing can be fused together to improve effectiveness, but this requires to traverse more than once the query terms' posting lists, thus prolonging the multiple query processing time. In this work, we propose an approach to optimize the processing of query variations to reduce their overall response time. Similarly to the standard Boolean model, we firstly represent a group of query variations as a logic function where Boolean variables represent query terms. We then apply factoring to such function, in order to produce a more compact but logically equivalent representation. The factored form is used to process the query variations in a single pass over the inverted index. We experimentally show that our approach can improve by up to 1.95\texttimes{} the mean processing time of a multiple query with no statistically significant degradation in terms of NDCG@10.},

abstract = {Text matching aims to establish the matching relationship between two texts. It is an important operation in some information retrieval related tasks such as question duplicate detection, question answering, and dialog systems. Bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) coupled with attention mechanism has achieved state-of-the-art performance in text matching. A major limitation of existing works is that only high level contextualized word representations are utilized to obtain word level matching results without considering other levels of word representations, thus resulting in incorrect matching decisions for cases where two words with different meanings are very close in high level contextualized word representation space. Therefore, instead of making decisions utilizing single level word representations, a multi-level matching network (MMN) is proposed in this paper for text matching, which utilizes multiple levels of word representations to obtain multiple word level matching results for final text level matching decision. Experimental results on two widely used benchmarks, SNLI and Scaitail, show that the proposed MMN achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

Our research investigates a search system with privacy warning labels, an approach inspired by decision making research on food nutrition labels. This approach is designed to alert users to potential privacy threats in their search for information as one possible avenue to address privacy concerns. Our primary goal is to understand the extent to which attitudes towards privacy are linked to behaviors that protect privacy. In the present study, participants were given a set of fact-based decision tasks from the domain of health search. Participants were rotated through variations of search engine results pages (SERPs) including a SERP with a privacy warning light system. Lastly, participants completed a survey to capture attitudes towards privacy, behaviors to protect privacy, and other demographic information. In addition to the comparison of interactive search behaviors of a privacy warning SERP with a control SERP, we compared self-report privacy measures with interactive search behaviors. Participants reported strong concerns around privacy of health information while simultaneously placing high importance on the correctness of this information.

abstract = {Research on computational argumentation has recently become very popular. An argument consists of a claim that is supported or attacked by at least one premise. Its intention is the persuasion of others. An important problem in this field is retrieving good premises for a designated claim from a corpus of arguments. Given a claim, oftentimes existing approaches' first step is finding textually similar claims. In this paper we compare 196 methods systematically for determining similar claims by textual similarity, using a large corpus of (claim, premise) pairs crawled from debate portals. We also evaluate how well textual similarity of claims can predict relevance of the associated premises.},

abstract = {Estimating click-through rate (CTR) accurately has an essential impact on improving user experience and revenue in sponsored search. For CTR prediction model, it is necessary to make out user's real-time search intention. Most of the current work is to mine their intentions based on users' real-time behaviors. However, it is difficult to capture the intention when user behaviors are sparse, causing thebehavior sparsity problem. Moreover, it is difficult for user to jump out of their specific historical behaviors for possible interest exploration, namelyweak generalization problem. We propose a new approach Graph Intention Network (GIN) based on co-occurrence commodity graph to mine user intention. By adopting multi-layered graph diffusion, GIN enriches user behaviors to solve the behavior sparsity problem. By introducing co-occurrence relationship of commodities to explore the potential preferences, the weak generalization problem is also alleviated. To the best of our knowledge, the GIN method is the first to introduce graph learning for user intention mining in CTR prediction and propose end-to-end joint training of graph learning and CTR prediction tasks in sponsored search. At present, GIN has achieved excellent offline results on the real-world data of the e-commerce platform outperforming existing deep learning models, and has been running stable tests online and achieved significant CTR improvements.},

In this regard, keyword search enables non-expert users to access the data contained in RDF datasets intuitively.

First, what are task characteristics that influence a user's ability to gain benefits from others' trails? Second, what is the impact of a "mismatch" between a current user's task and previous user's task which originated the trail? We report on a study that investigated the influence of two factors on participants' perceptions and behaviors while using search trails to complete tasks. Our first factor, task scope, focused on the scope of the task assigned to the participant (broad to narrow). Our manipulation of this factor involved varying the number of constraints associated with tasks. Our second factor, trail scope, focused on the scope of the task that originated the search trails given to participants. We investigated how task scope and trail scope affected participants' (RQ1) pre-task perceptions, (RQ2) post-task perceptions, and (RQ3) search behaviors. We discuss implications of our results for systems that use search trails to provide assistance.},

abstract = {Axiomatic information retrieval (IR) seeks a set of principle properties desirable in IR models. These properties when formally expressed provide guidance in the search for better relevance estimation functions. Neural ranking models typically contain many learnable parameters. The training of these models involves a search for appropriate parameter values based on large quantities of labeled examples. Intuitively, axioms that can guide the search for better traditional IR models should also help in better parameter estimation for machine learning based rankers. This work explores the use of IR axioms to augment the direct supervision from labeled data for training neural ranking models. We modify the documents in our dataset along the lines of well-known axioms during training and add a regularization loss based on the agreement between the ranking model and the axioms on which version of the document---the original or the perturbed---should be preferred. Our experiments show that the neural ranking model achieves faster convergence and better generalization with axiomatic regularization.},

Experimental results demonstrate that the contextual text representations from BERT are more effective than traditional word embeddings. Compared to bag-of-words retrieval models, the contextual language model can better leverage language structures, bringing large improvements on queries written in natural languages. Combining the text understanding ability with search knowledge leads
to an enhanced pre-trained BERT model that can benefit related search tasks where training data are limited.},

Experimental results indicate that the interpretability of a search result summary is a salient factor influencing users' click decisions. Users are less likely to click on a result link if they do not understand why it was retrieved (low transparency) or cannot assess if the result would be useful based on the summary (low assessability).

We also propose filtering techniques to eliminate training samples that are too far out of domain using two techniques: a heuristic-based approach and novel supervised filter that re-purposes a neural ranker. Using several leading neural ranking architectures and multiple weak supervision datasets, we show that these sources of training pairs are effective on their own (outperforming prior weak supervision techniques), and that filtering can further improve performance.},

abstract = {In recent years, the proliferation of smart mobile devices has lead to the gradual integration of search functionality within mobile platforms. This has created an incentive to move away from the "ten blue links" metaphor, as mobile users are less likely to click on them, expecting to get the answer directly from the snippets. In turn, this has revived the interest in Question Answering. Then, along came chatbots, conversational systems, and messaging platforms, where the user needs could be better served with the system asking follow-up questions in order to better understand the user's intent. While typically a user would expect a single response at any utterance, a system could also return multiple options for the user to select from, based on different system understandings of the user's intent. However, this possibility should not be overused, as this practice could confuse and/or annoy the user. How to produce good variable-length lists, given the conflicting objectives of staying short while maximizing the likelihood of having a correct answer included in the list, is an underexplored problem. It is also unclear how to evaluate a system that tries to do that. Here we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we define some necessary and some optional properties that an evaluation measure fit for this purpose should have. We further show that existing evaluation measures from the IR tradition are not entirely suitable for this setup, and we propose novel evaluation measures that address it satisfactorily.},

Moreover, many due diligence systems strive to facilitate real-time interactions and so time from document ingestion to availability should be minimal. Such constraints further limit the possible solution space when identifying near duplicate documents. We present an examination of the tradeoffs that document signature methods face in the due diligence domain. In particular, we quantify the trade-off between signature length, time to compute, number of hash collisions, and number of nearest neighbours for a 90,000 document due diligence corpus.},

abstract = {A recent trend in IR has been the usage of neural networks to learn retrieval models for text based adhoc search. While various approaches and architectures have yielded significantly better performance than traditional retrieval models such as BM25, it is still difficult to understand exactly why a document is relevant to a query. In the ML community several approaches for explaining decisions made by deep neural networks have been proposed -- including DeepSHAP which modifies the DeepLift algorithm to estimate the relative importance (shapley values) of input features for a given decision by comparing the activations in the network for a given image against the activations caused by a reference input. In image classification, the reference input tends to be a plain black image. While DeepSHAP has been well studied for image classification tasks, it remains to be seen how we can adapt it to explain the output of Neural Retrieval Models (NRMs). In particular, what is a good "black" image in the context of IR? In this paper we explored various reference input document construction techniques. Additionally, we compared the explanations generated by DeepSHAP to LIME (a model agnostic approach) and found that the explanations differ considerably. Our study raises concerns regarding the robustness and accuracy of explanations produced for NRMs. With this paper we aim to shed light on interesting problems surrounding interpretability in NRMs and highlight areas of future work.},

abstract = {Knowledge Based Question Answering (KBQA) is one of the most promising approaches to provide suitable answers for the queries posted by users. Relation detection that aims to take full advantage of the substantial knowledge contained in knowledge base (KB) becomes increasingly important. Significant progress has been made in performing relation detection over KB. However, recent deep neural networks that achieve the state of the art on KB-based relation detection task only consider the context information of question sentences rather than the relatedness between question and answer candidates, and exclusively extract the relation from KB triple rather than learn informative relational path. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-driven Relation Detection network (KRD) to interactively learn answer-enhanced question representations and path-aware relation representations for relation detection. A Siamese LSTM is employed into a similarity matching process between the question representation and relation representation. Experimental results on the SimpleQuestions and WebQSP datasets demonstrate that KRD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a series of ablation test show the robust superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) algorithm is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used in production, for tasks that include Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction and learning-to-rank. To deal with the massive datasets available today, many distributed GBT methods have been proposed. However, they all assume a row-distributed dataset, addressing scalability only with respect to the number of data points and not the number of features, and increasing communication cost for high-dimensional data. In order to allow for scalability across both the data point and feature dimensions, and reduce communication cost, we propose block-distributed GBTs. We achieve communication efficiency by making full use of the data sparsity and adapting the Quickscorer algorithm to the block-distributed setting. We evaluate our approach using datasets with millions of features, and demonstrate that we are able to achieve multiple orders of magnitude reduction in communication cost for sparse data, with no loss in accuracy, while providing a more scalable design. As a result, we are able to reduce the training time for high-dimensional data, and allow more cost-effective scale-out without the need for expensive network communication.},

abstract = {Fine-grained image classification and retrieval become topical in both computer vision and information retrieval. In real-life scenarios, fine-grained tasks tend to appear along with coarse-grained tasks when the observed object is coming closer. However, in previous works, the combination of fine-grained and coarse-grained tasks was often ignored. In this paper, we define a new problem called coarse-to-fine grained classification (C2FGC) which aims to recognize the classes of objects in multiple resolutions (from low to high). To solve this problem, we propose a novel Multi-linear Pooling with Hierarchy (MLPH) model. Specifically, we first design a multi-linear pooling module to include both trilinear and bilinear pooling, and then formulate the coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks within a unified framework. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {How to decompose a large global matrix into many small local matrices has been recently researched a lot for matrix approximation. However, the distance computation in matrix decomposition is a challenging issue, as no prior knowledge about the most appropriate feature vectors and distance measures are available. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for local matrix construction without involving distance computation. The basic idea is based on the application of convergence probabilities of graph random walk. At first, a user-item bipartite graph is constructed from the global matrix. After performing random walk on the bipartite graph, we select some user-item pairs as anchors. Then another random walk with restart is applied to construct the local matrix for each anchor. Finally, the global matrix approximation is obtained by averaging the prediction results of local matrices. Our experiments on the four real-world datasets show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of lower prediction errors and higher coverage ratios.},

Building on past work, we show that BM25-inspired Gaussian priors for Bayesian logistic regression based on topical keywords provide better effectiveness than the usual L2 (zero mode, uniform variance) Gaussian prior. On two high recall retrieval datasets, the resulting models transition smoothly from BM25 level effectiveness to discriminative effectiveness as training data volume increases, dominating L2 regularization even when substantial training data is available.},

Simple data aggregations can help to cope with space and time constraints, while at the same time improve the effectiveness of certain applications, such as topic detection or summarization. We propose a lightweight representation of newsworthy social media data. The proposed representation leverages microblog features, such as redundancy and re-sharing capabilities, by using surrogate texts from shared URLs and word embeddings. Our representation allows us to achieve comparable clustering results to those obtained by using the complete data, while reducing running time and required memory.

This has motivated news agencies to share their contents via such platforms in addition to their websites and popular social media. As a result, thousands of users nowadays follow the news agencies through their verified channels in IM services. However, user interactions with such platforms is relatively unstudied. In this paper, we provide an initial study to analyze and predict news popularity in an instant messaging service. To this aim, we focus on Telegram, a popular IM service with 200 million monthly active users. We explore the differences between news popularity analysis in Telegram and typical social media, such as Twitter, and highlight its unique characteristics. We perform our analysis on the data we collected from four diverse news agencies. Following our analysis, we study the task of news popularity prediction in Telegram and show that the performance of the prediction models can be substantially improved by learning from the data of multiple news agencies using multi-task learning. To foster research in this area, we have made the collected data publicly available.},

We design a neural architecture of sequence-to-sequence learning to calculate the deep representations of users' reviews on items following an adversarial training strategy. At the same time we jointly learn to factorize the rating matrix, by regularizing the deep representations of reviews with the user and item latent features. In doing so, our model captures the non-linear associations among reviews and ratings while producing a review for each user-item pair. Our experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.},

The underlying idea is to account for the difficulty of topics, so that systems are scored relative to it. Webber et al. first proposed standardization through a non-linear transformation with the standard normal distribution, and recently Sakai proposed a simple linear transformation. In this paper, we show that both approaches are actually special cases of a simple standardization which assumes specific distributions for the per-topic scores. From this viewpoint, we argue that a transformation based on the empirical distribution is the most appropriate choice for this kind of standardization. Through a series of experiments on TREC data, we show the benefits of our proposal in terms of score stability and statistical test behavior.},

In real-world applications, those feedbacks are possibly contaminated by imperfect user behaviours, posing challenges on the design of robust recommendation methods. Some methods apply man-made noises on the input data to train the networks more effectively (e.g. the collaborative denoising auto-encoder). In this work, we propose a general adversarial training framework for NN-based recommendation models, improving both the model robustness and the overall performance. We apply our approach on the collaborative auto-encoder model, and show that the combination of adversarial training and NN-based models outperforms highly competitive state-of-the-art recommendation methods on three public datasets.},

abstract = {Recent advances in sequence-aware approaches for session-based recommendation, such as those based on recurrent neural networks, highlight the importance of leveraging sequential information from a session while making recommendations. Further, a session based k-nearest-neighbors approach (SKNN) has proven to be a strong baseline for session-based recommendations. However, SKNN does not take into account the readily available sequential and temporal information from sessions. In this work, we propose Sequence and Time Aware Neighborhood (STAN), with vanilla SKNN as its special case. STAN takes into account the following factors for making recommendations: i) position of an item in the current session, ii) recency of a past session w.r.t. to the current session, and iii) position of a recommendable item in a neighboring session. The importance of above factors for a specific application can be adjusted via controllable decay factors. Despite being simple, intuitive and easy to implement, empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that STAN significantly improves over SKNN, and is even comparable to the recently proposed state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Our results suggest that STAN can be considered as a strong baseline for evaluating session-based recommendation algorithms in future.},

Recent approaches for sequential recommendations often render past actions of a user into a sequence, seeking to capture the temporal dynamics in the sequence to predict the next item. However, the interests of users evolve over time together due to their mutual influence, and most of existing methods lack the ability to utilize the rich coevolutionary patterns available in underlying data represented by sequential graphs. In order to capture the co-evolving knowledge for sequential recommendations, we start from introducing an efficient spectral convolution operation to discover complex relationships between users and items from the spectral domain of a graph, where the hidden connectivity information of the graph can be revealed. Then, the spectral convolution is generalized into an recurrent method by utilizing gated mechanisms to model sequential graphs. Experimentally, we demonstrate the advantages of modeling co-evolving patterns, and Gated Spectral Units (GSUs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {Existing recommendation methods mostly learn fixed vectors for users and items in a low-dimensional continuous space, and then calculate the popular dot-product to derive user-item distances. However, these methods suffer from two drawbacks: (1) the data sparsity issue prevents from learning high-quality representations; and (2) the dot-product violates the crucial triangular inequality and therefore, results in a sub-optimal performance. In this work, in order to overcome the two aforementioned drawbacks, we propose Deep Distribution Network (DDN) to model users and items via Gaussian distributions. We argue that, compared to fixed vectors, distribution-based representations are more powerful to characterize users' uncertain interests and items' distinct properties. In addition, we propose a Wasserstein-based loss, in which the critical triangular inequality can be satisfied. In experiments, we evaluate DDN and comparative models on standard datasets. It is shown that DDN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed distribution-based representations and wassertein loss.},

In this work, we investigated how people organize and structure information they discover during exploratory searches. In a lab study, we asked 24 participants to take hand-written notes they could use in the future while they were completing an exploratory search. We then asked participants to organize their findings to share with someone else who wants to explore the topic. Finally, we conducted post-session interviews to gain insights into the types of information saved and how participants organized the information they found. In our qualitative analysis of the notes and interviews, we found that the notes included background information about the topic, key concepts, specific details, useful information sources, and information to help with the broader work task. Notes were primarily structured in lists, and reflected a combination of linear note-taking strategies and grouping by information source or topical themes. Participants changed the content and structure of the shared notes to make them easier to understand and to provide a more thorough overview of the topic. Our findings have implications for the design of search tools to help current searchers organize, structure, and synthesize information and to help future searchers engaged in similar information seeking tasks.},

abstract = {Emotions are an essential part of most human activities, including decision-making. Emotions arise in response to information, e.g., presented in web pages, and are also expressed in the words used to convey that information in the first place. In this paper, we study the emotion profile of retrieved and clicked web search results towards the goal of better understanding the role of emotions in web search. Using click logs from a four-month period, up to the end of January 2019, we examine the emotions associated with search results and contrast them to the emotions of clicked results, taking rank and relevance into account. Emotions are assigned to web pages based on two lexicons: SentiWordNet (positive, negative and objective sentiments) and EmoLexData (afraid, amused, angry, annoyed, don't care, happy, inspired, and sad emotions). We look at the sentiment/emotion profiles of search results grouped around a set of controversial and mundane topics and hypothesise that users are more likely to click emotionally charged results than emotionless results, both in general, and in particular when their query relates to controversial topics.},

abstract = {Document representation is the core of many NLP tasks on machine understanding. A general representation learned in an unsupervised manner reserves generality and can be used for various applications. In practice, sentiment analysis (SA) has been a challenging task that is regarded to be deeply semantic-related and is often used to assess general representations. Existing methods on unsupervised document representation learning can be separated into two families: sequential ones, which explicitly take the ordering of words into consideration, and non-sequential ones, which do not explicitly do so. However, both of them suffer from their own weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a model that overcomes difficulties encountered by both families of methods. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular SA datasets and a fine-grained aspect-based SA by a large margin.},

Despite potential usefulness in downstream IR and NLP tasks, these CLE models have almost exclusively been evaluated on word translation tasks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive comparative evaluation of projection-based CLE models for both sentence-level and document-level cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). We show that in some settings resource-lean CLE-based CLIR models may outperform resource-intensive models using full-blown machine translation (MT).

We propose a FAQ retrieval system that considers the similarity between a user's query and a question as well as the relevance between the query and an answer. Although a common approach to FAQ retrieval is to construct labeled data for training, it takes annotation costs. Therefore, we use a traditional unsupervised information retrieval system to calculate the similarity between the query and question. On the other hand, the relevance between the query and answer can be learned by using QA pairs in a FAQ database. The recently-proposed BERT model is used for the relevance calculation. Since the number of QA pairs in FAQ page is not enough to train a model, we cope with this issue by leveraging FAQ sets that are similar to the one in question. We evaluate our approach on two datasets. The first one is localgovFAQ, a dataset we construct in a Japanese administrative municipality domain. The second is StackExchange dataset, which is the public dataset in English. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods on these datasets.},

Based on a search among more than 300,000 arguments, four standard retrieval models are compared on 40 topics for 20 controversial issues: every issue has one topic with a biased stance and another neutral one. Following TREC, the top results of the different models on a topic were pooled and relevance-judged by one assessor per topic. The assessors also judged the arguments' rhetorical, logical, and dialectical quality, the results of which were cross-referenced with the relevance judgments. Furthermore, the assessors were asked for their personal opinion, and whether it matched the predefined stance of a topic. Among other results, we find that Terrier's implementations of DirichletLM and DPH are on par, significantly outperforming TFIDF and BM25. The judgments of relevance and quality hardly correlate, giving rise to a more diverse set of ranking criteria than relevance alone. We did not measure a significant bias of assessors when their stance is at odds with a topic's stance.},

abstract = {Product based models, which represent multi-field categorical data as embedding vectors of features, then model feature interactions in terms of vector product of shared embedding, have been extensively studied and have become one of the most popular techniques for CTR prediction. However, if the shared embedding is applied: (1) the angles of feature interactions of different orders may conflict with each other, (2) the gradients of feature interactions of high-orders may vanish, which result in learned feature interactions less effective. To solve these problems, we propose a novel technique named Order-aware Embedding (i.e., multi-embeddings are learned for each feature, and different embeddings are applied for feature interactions of different orders), which can be applied to various models and generates feature interactions more effectively. We further propose a novel order-aware embedding neural network (OENN) based on this embedding technique for CTR prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Order-aware Embedding and show that our OENN outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Document ranking experiments should be repeatable. However, the interaction between multi-threaded indexing and score ties during retrieval may yield non-deterministic rankings, making repeatability not as trivial as one might imagine. In the context of the open-source Lucene search engine, score ties are broken by internal document ids, which are assigned at index time. Due to multi-threaded indexing, which makes experimentation with large modern document collections practical, internal document ids are not assigned consistently between different index instances of the same collection, and thus score ties are broken unpredictably. This short paper examines the effectiveness impact of such score ties, quantifying the variability that can be attributed to this phenomenon. The obvious solution to this non-determinism and to ensure repeatable document ranking is to break score ties using external collection document ids. This approach, however, comes with measurable efficiency costs due to the necessity of consulting external identifiers during query evaluation.},

In a recent SIGIR Forum article, Lin expressed skepticism that neural ranking models were actually improving ad hoc retrieval effectiveness in limited data scenarios. He provided anecdotal evidence that authors of neural IR papers demonstrate "wins" by comparing against weak baselines. This paper provides a rigorous evaluation of those claims in two ways: First, we conducted a meta-analysis of papers that have reported experimental results on the TREC Robust04 test collection. We do not find evidence of an upward trend in effectiveness over time. In fact, the best reported results are from a decade ago and no recent neural approach comes close. Second, we applied five recent neural models to rerank the strong baselines that Lin used to make his arguments. A significant improvement was observed for one of the models, demonstrating additivity in gains. While there appears to be merit to neural IR approaches, at least some of the gains reported in the literature appear illusory.},

One of the major challenges to multi-turn conversational search is to model the conversation history to answer the current question. Existing methods either prepend history turns to the current question or use complicated attention mechanisms to model the history. We propose a conceptually simple yet highly effective approach referred to as history answer embedding. It enables seamless integration of conversation history into a conversational question answering (ConvQA) model built on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We first explain our view that ConvQA is a simplified but concrete setting of conversational search, and then we provide a general framework to solve ConvQA. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under this framework. Finally, we analyze the impact of different numbers of history turns under different settings to provide new insights into conversation history modeling in ConvQA.},

abstract = {Low-frequency terms are a recurring challenge for information retrieval models, especially neural IR frameworks struggle with adequately capturing infrequently observed words. While these terms are often removed from neural models - mainly as a concession to efficiency demands - they traditionally play an important role in the performance of IR models. In this paper, we analyze the effects of low-frequency terms on the performance and robustness of neural IR models. We conduct controlled experiments on three recent neural IR models, trained on a large-scale passage retrieval collection. We evaluate the neural IR models with various vocabulary sizes for their respective word embeddings, considering different levels of constraints on the available GPU memory. We observe that despite the significant benefits of using larger vocabularies, the performance gap between the vocabularies can be, to a great extent, mitigated by extensive tuning of a related parameter: the number of documents to re-rank. We further investigate the use of subword-token embedding models, and in particular FastText, for neural IR models. Our experiments show that using FastText brings slight improvements to the overall performance of the neural IR models in comparison to models trained on the full vocabulary, while the improvement becomes much more pronounced for queries containing low-frequency terms.},

Third, we define a semantic measure based on knowledge graph to evaluate the similarity between medical texts, and perform the text classification task. This measure can value semantic relatedness between medical documents, to enhance the text classification. We use medical archives collected from real hospitals for validation.

However, existing approaches largely rely on the modelling of semantic relatedness of an aspect with its context words, while to some extent ignore their syntactic dependencies within sentences. Consequently, this may lead to an undesirable result that the aspect attends on contextual words that are descriptive of other aspects. In this paper, we propose a proximity-weighted convolution network to offer an aspect-specific syntax-aware representation of contexts. In particular, two ways of determining proximity weight are explored, namely position proximity and dependency proximity. The representation is primarily abstracted by a bidirectional LSTM architecture and further enhanced by a proximity-weighted convolution.

The conditions are defined based on PICO elements, namely, Patient, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome. Hence, PICO annotations in medical literature are essential for automatic relevant document filtering. However, defining boundaries of text spans for PICO elements is not straightforward. In this paper, we study the agreement of PICO annotations made by multiple human annotators, including both experts and non-experts. Agreements are estimated by a standard span agreement (i.e. matching both labels and boundaries of text spans), and two types of relaxed span agreement (i.e. matching labels without guaranteeing matching boundaries of spans). Based on the analysis, we report two observations: (i) Boundaries of PICO span annotations by individual annotators are very diverse. (ii) Despite the disagreement in span boundaries, general areas of the span annotations arebroadly agreed by annotators. Our results suggest that applying a standard agreement alone may undermine the agreement of PICO spans, and adopting both a standard and a relaxed agreements is more suitable for PICO span evaluation.},

abstract = {The central idea of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of song lyrics computationally. We focus on two aspects: style and biases of song lyrics. All prior works to understand these two aspects are limited to manual analysis of a small corpus of song lyrics. In contrast, we analyzed more than half a million songs spread over five decades. We characterize the lyrics style in terms of vocabulary, length, repetitiveness, speed, and readability. We have observed that the style of popular songs significantly differs from other songs. We have used distributed representation methods and WEAT test to measure various gender and racial biases in the song lyrics. We have observed that biases in song lyrics correlate with prior results on human subjects. This correlation indicates that song lyrics reflect the biases that exist in society. Increasing consumption of music and the effect of lyrics on human emotions makes this analysis important.},

abstract = {Word embeddings have gained significant attention as learnable representations of semantic relations between words, and have been shown to improve upon the results of traditional word representations. However, little effort has been devoted to using embeddings for the retrieval of entity associations beyond pairwise relations. In this paper, we use popular embedding methods to train vector representations of an entity-annotated news corpus, and evaluate their performance for the task of predicting entity participation in news events versus a traditional word cooccurrence network as a baseline. To support queries for events with multiple participating entities, we test a number of combination modes for the embedding vectors. While we find that even the best combination modes for word embeddings do not quite reach the performance of the full cooccurrence network, especially for rare entities, we observe that different embedding methods model different types of relations, thereby indicating the potential for ensemble methods.},

Previous methods mainly focus on in-target setting that models are trained and tested using data specific to the same target. In practical cases, the target we concern may have few or no labeled data, which restrains us from training a target-specific model. In this paper we study the problem of cross-target stance detection, utilizing labeled data of a source target to learn models that can be adapted to a destination target. To this end, we propose an effective method, the core intuition of which is to leverage shared latent topics between two targets as transferable knowledge to facilitate model adaptation. Our method acquires topic knowledge with neural variational inference, and further adopts adversarial training that encourages the model to learn target-invariant representations. Experimental results verify that our proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Predicting users' irregular trips in a short term period is one of the crucial tasks in the intelligent transportation system. With the prediction, the taxi requesting services, such as Didi Chuxing in China, can manage the transportation resources to offer better services. There are several different transportation scenes, such as commuting scene and entertainment scene. The origin and the destination of entertainment scene are more unsure than that of commuting scene, so both origin and destination should be predicted. Moreover, users' trips on Didi platform is only a part of their real life, so these transportation data are only few weak samples. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Taxi Demand Prediction (TDP) model in challenging entertainment scene based on heterogeneous graph embedding and deep neural predicting network. TDP aims to predict next possible trip edges that have not appeared in historical data for each user in entertainment scene. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that TDP achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Fraudulent claim detection is one of the greatest challenges the insurance industry faces. Alibaba's return-freight insurance, providing return-shipping postage compensations over product return on the e-commerce platform, receives thousands of potentially fraudulent claims everyday. Such deliberate abuse of the insurance policy could lead to heavy financial losses. In order to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims, we developed a novel data-driven procedure to identify groups of organized fraudsters, one of the major contributions to financial losses, by learning network information. In this paper, we introduce a device-sharing network among claimants, followed by developing an automated solution for fraud detection based on graph learning algorithms, to separate fraudsters from regular customers and uncover groups of organized fraudsters. This solution applied at Alibaba achieves more than 80% precision while covering 44% more suspicious accounts compared with a previously deployed rule-based classifier after human expert investigations. Our approach can easily and effectively generalizes to other types of insurance.},

Traditionally FM models are trained in batch mode, which entails training the model with large datasets every few hours or days. Such training procedure cannot capture the trends evolving in real time with large volume of streaming data. In this paper, we propose an online training scheme for FM with the alternating least squares (ALS) technique, which has comparable performance with existing batch training algorithms. We incorporate an online update mechanism to the model parameters at the cost of storing a small cache. The mechanism also stabilizes the training error more than a traditional online training technique like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as data points come in, which is crucial for real-time applications. Experiments on large scale datasets validate the efficiency and robustness of our method.},

In this paper, we analyze the spectral properties of the Pearson and the cosine similarity estimators, and we use tools from random matrix theory to argue that they suffer from noise and eigenvalues spreading. We argue that, unlike the Pearson correlation, the cosine similarity naturally possesses the desirable property of eigenvalue shrinkage for large eigenvalues. However, due to its zero-mean assumption, it overestimates the largest eigenvalues. We quantify this overestimation and present a simple re-scaling and noise cleaning scheme. This results in better performance of the memory-based methods compared to their vanilla counterparts.},

Since most item recommendation models have only considered the role of a user as a consumer, how to leverage the two roles to improve UGC recommendation accuracy has been underexplored. In this paper, based on the state-of-the-art UGC recommendation method called CPRec (consumer and producer based recommendation), we propose ABCPRec (adaptively bridging CPRec). Unlike CPRec, which assumes that the two roles of a user are always related to each other, ABCPRec adaptively bridges the two roles according to the similarity between her nature as a consumer and that as a producer. This enables the model to learn each user's characteristics as both a consumer and a producer and to recommend items to each user more accurately. By using two real-world datasets, we showed that our proposed method significantly outperformed comparative methods in terms of AUC.},

abstract = {Distance metric learning based on triplet loss has been applied with success in a wide range of applications such as face recognition, image retrieval, speaker change detection and recently recommendation with the Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) model. However, as we show in this article, CML requires large batches to work reasonably well because of a too simplistic uniform negative sampling strategy for selecting triplets. Due to memory limitations, this makes it difficult to scale in high-dimensional scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose here a 2-stage negative sampling strategy which finds triplets that are highly informative for learning. Our strategy allows CML to work effectively in terms of accuracy and popularity bias, even when the batch size is an order of magnitude smaller than what would be needed with the default uniform sampling. We demonstrate the suitability of the proposed strategy for recommendation and exhibit consistent positive results across various datasets.},

abstract = {With the growing importance of personalized recommendation, numerous recommendation models have been proposed recently. Among them, Matrix Factorization (MF) based models are the most widely used in the recommendation field due to their high performance. However, MF based models suffer from cold start problems where user-item interactions are sparse. To deal with this problem, content based recommendation models which use the auxiliary attributes of users and items have been proposed. Since these models use auxiliary attributes, they are effective in cold start settings. However, most of the proposed models are either unable to capture complex feature interactions or not properly designed to combine user-item feedback information with content information. In this paper, we propose Self-Attentive Integration Network (SAIN) which is a model that effectively combines user-item feedback information and auxiliary information for recommendation task. In SAIN, a self-attention mechanism is used in the feature-level interaction layer to effectively consider interactions between multiple features, while the information integration layer adaptively combines content and feedback information. The experimental results on two public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 2.13%},

Furthermore, assuming that the image results a user has examined might affect her following judgments, we propose the Context-Aware Gain (CAG), a novel evaluation metric that incorporates the contextual effects within the well-known gain-discount framework. Our experiment results show that, with a proper combination of discount functions, the proposed context-aware evaluation metric can significantly improve the performances of offline metrics for image search evaluation, considering user satisfaction as the golden standard.},

Later, official relevance assessments were rendered by NIST for documents selected by depth-10 pooling augmented by move-to-front (MTF) pooling (Cormack et al. 1998), as well as the documents selected by our Dynamic Sampling effort. MAP estimates rendered from dynamically sampled assessments using the xinfAP statistical evaluator are comparable to those rendered from the complete set of official assessments using the standard trec_eval tool. MAP estimates rendered using only documents selected by pooling, on the other hand, differ substantially. The results suggest that the use of Dynamic Sampling without pooling can, for an order of magnitude less assessment effort, yield information-retrieval effectiveness estimates that exhibit lower bias, lower error, and comparable ability to rank system effectiveness.},

For example, customers want to buy a jacket which can go well with their jeans and sneakers. To address the task of fashion matching, we propose a neural compatibility model for ranking fashion products based on the compatibility matching with the input outfit. The contribution of our work is twofold. First, we demonstrate that product descriptions contain rich information about product comparability which has not been fully utilized in the prior work. Secondly, we exploit such useful information from text data by taking advantages of semantic matching and lexical matching both of which are important for fashion matching. The proposed model is evaluated on a real-world fashion outfit dataset and achieves the state-of-the-art results by comparing to the competitive baselines. In the future work, we plan to extend the model by incorporating product images which are the major data source in the prior work on fashion matching.},

abstract = {Existing review-based recommendation methods usually use the same model to learn the representations of all users/items from reviews posted by users towards items. However, different users have different preference and different items have different characteristics. Thus, the same word or the similar reviews may have different informativeness for different users and items. In this paper we propose a neural recommendation approach with personalized attention to learn personalized representations of users and items from reviews. We use a review encoder to learn representations of reviews from words, and a user/item encoder to learn representations of users or items from reviews. We propose a personalized attention model, and apply it to both review and user/item encoders to select different important words and reviews for different users/items. Experiments on five datasets validate our approach can effectively improve the performance of neural recommendation.},

Similar scenarios appear in computational advertising, news recommendation, and other interactive systems. As such environments give only partial feedback, the evaluation of new policies conventionally requires expensive online A/B tests. Counterfactual approach is a promising alternative, nevertheless, it requires specific conditions for a valid off-policy evaluation. We release a large-scale, real-world vertical-blending dataset gathered bySeznam.cz web search engine. The dataset contains logged partial feedback with the corresponding propensity and is thus suited for counterfactual evaluation. We provide basic checks for validity and evaluate several learning methods.},

abstract = {Learning-to-Rank is a branch of supervised machine learning that seeks to produce an ordering of a list of items such that the utility of the ranked list is maximized. Unlike most machine learning techniques, however, the objective cannot be directly optimized using gradient descent methods as it is either discontinuous or flat everywhere. As such, learning-to-rank methods often optimize a loss function that either is loosely related to or upper-bounds a ranking utility instead. A notable exception is the approximation framework originally proposed by Qin et al. that facilitates a more direct approach to ranking metric optimization. We revisit that framework almost a decade later in light of recent advances in neural networks and demonstrate its superiority empirically. Through this study, we hope to show that the ideas from that work are more relevant than ever and can lay the foundation of learning-to-rank research in the age of deep neural networks.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel reinforcement learning based model for named entity recognition (NER), referred to as MM-NER. Inspired by the methodology of the AlphaGo Zero, MM-NER formalizes the problem of named entity recognition with a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process (MDP) model, in which the time steps correspond to the positions of words in a sentence from left to right, and each action corresponds to assign an NER tag to a word. Two Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are used to summarize the past tag assignments and words in the sentence. Based on the outputs of GRUs, the policy for guiding the tag assignment and the value for predicting the whole tagging accuracy of the whole sentence are produced. The policy and value are then strengthened with MCTS, which takes the produced raw policy and value as inputs, simulates and evaluates the possible tag assignments at the subsequent positions, and outputs a better search policy for assigning tags. A reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to train the model parameters. Empirically, we show that MM-NER can accurately predict the tags thanks to the exploratory decision making mechanism introduced by MCTS. It outperformed the conventional sequence tagging baselines and performed equally well with the state-of-the-art baseline BLSTM-CRF.},

abstract = {User-centered approaches have been extensively studied and used in the area of struggling search. Related research has targeted key aspects of users such as user satisfaction or frustration, and search success or failure, using a variety of experimental methods including laboratory user studies, in-situ explicit feedback from searchers and by using crowdsourcing. Such studies are valuable in advancing the understanding of search difficulty from a user's perspective, and yield insights that can directly improve search systems and their evaluation. However, little is known about how user moods influence their interactions with a search system or their perception of struggling. In this work, we show that a user's own mood. can systematically bias the user's perception, and experience while interacting with a search system and trying to satisfy an information need. People who are in activated-(un)pleasant moods tend to issue more queries than people in deactivated or neutral moods. Those in an unpleasant mood perceive a higher level of difficulty. Our insights extend the current understanding of struggling search tasks and have important implications on the design and evaluation of search systems supporting such tasks.},

As a core module of the customer service bot, user intent prediction can help predict user questions before they ask. A typical solution is to find top candidate questions that a user will be interested in. Such solution ignores the inter-relationship between questions and often aims to maximize the immediate reward such as clicks, which may not be ideal in practice. Hence, we propose to view the problem as a sequential decision making process to better capture the long-term effects of each recommendation in the list. Intuitively, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and consider using reinforcement learning for the problem. With this approach, questions presented to users are both relevant and diverse. Experiments on offline real-world dataset and online system demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Classifying the general intent of the user utterance in a conversation, also known as Dialogue Act (DA), e.g., open-ended question, statement of opinion, or request for an opinion, is a key step in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for conversational agents. While DA classification has been extensively studied in human-human conversations, it has not been sufficiently explored for the emerging open-domain automated conversational agents. Moreover, despite significant advances in utterance-level DA classification, full understanding of dialogue utterances requires conversational context. Another challenge is the lack of available labeled data for open-domain human-machine conversations. To address these problems, we propose a novel method, CDAC (Contextual Dialogue Act Classifier), a simple yet effective deep learning approach for contextual dialogue act classification. Specifically, we use transfer learning to adapt models trained on human-human conversations to predict dialogue acts in human-machine dialogues. To investigate the effectiveness of our method, we train our model on the well-known Switchboard human-human dialogue dataset, and fine-tune it for predicting dialogue acts in human-machine conversation data, collected as part of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 competition. The results show that the CDAC model outperforms an utterance-level state of the art baseline by 8.0% on the Switchboard dataset, and is comparable to the latest reported state-of-the-art contextual DA classification results. Furthermore, our results show that fine-tuning the CDAC model on a small sample of manually labeled human-machine conversations allows CDAC to more accurately predict dialogue acts in real users' conversations, suggesting a promising direction for future improvements.},

The performance bottleneck of existing solutions is inner product computation phase. Exploiting Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the computation intensive workloads is the gold standard in data mining and machine learning communities. However, it is not trivial to apply CPU-GPU systems to boost the performance of IPR solutions due to the nature complex of the IPR problem. In this work, we analyze the time cost of each phase in IPR solutions at first. Second, we exploit the characteristics of CPU-GPU systems to improve performance. Specifically, the computation tasks of IPR solution are heterogeneously processed in CPU-GPU systems. Third, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposal on four standard real datasets.},

Treating IR models as black-boxes makes it difficult to understand or explain why certain documents are retrieved at top-ranks for a given query. Local explanation models have emerged as a popular means to understand individual predictions of classification models. However, there is no systematic investigation that learns to interpret IR models, which is in fact the core contribution of our work in this paper. We explore three sampling methods to train an explanation model and propose two metrics to evaluate explanations generated for an IR model. Our experiments reveal some interesting observations, namely that a) diversity in samples is important for training local explanation models, and b) the stability of a model is inversely proportional to the number of parameters used to explain the model.},

Most of the existing open source information retrieval systems are implemented in Java or C++ programming language. In this paper, we propose Parrot1, a Python-based interactive platform for information retrieval research. The proposed platform has mainly three advantages in comparison with the existing retrieval systems: (1) It is integrated with Jupyter Notebook, an interactive programming platform which has proved to be effective for data scientists to tackle big data and AI problems. As a result, users can interactively visualize and diagnose a retrieval model; (2) As an application written in Python, it can be easily used in combination with the popular deep learning frameworks such as Tersorflow and Pytorch; (3) It is designed especially for researchers. Less code is needed to create a new retrieval model or to modify an existing one. Our efforts have focused on three functionalists: good usability, interactive programming, and good interoperability with the popular deep learning frameworks. To confirm the performance of the proposed system, we conduct comparative experiments on a number of standard test collections. The experimental results show that the proposed system is both efficient and effective, providing a practical framework for researchers in information retrieval.},

abstract = {Text matching is the core problem in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as information retrieval, question answering, and conversation. Recently, deep leaning technology has been widely adopted for text matching, making neural text matching a new and active research domain. With a large number of neural matching models emerging rapidly, it becomes more and more difficult for researchers, especially those newcomers, to learn and understand these new models. Moreover, it is usually difficult to try these models due to the tedious data pre-processing, complicated parameter configuration, and massive optimization tricks, not to mention the unavailability of public codes sometimes. Finally, for researchers who want to develop new models, it is also not an easy task to implement a neural text matching model from scratch, and to compare with a bunch of existing models. In this paper, therefore, we present a novel system, namely MatchZoo, to facilitate the learning, practicing and designing of neural text matching models. The system consists of a powerful matching library and a user-friendly and interactive studio, which can help researchers: 1) to learn state-of-the-art neural text matching models systematically, 2) to train, test and apply these models with simple configurable steps; and 3) to develop their own models with rich APIs and assistance.},

abstract = {We describe a human-in-the loop system - AgentBuddy, that is helping Intuit improve the quality of search it offers to its internal Customer Care Agents (CCAs). AgentBuddy aims to reduce the cognitive effort on part of the CCAs while at the same time boosting the quality of our legacy federated search system. Under the hood, it leverages bandit algorithms to improve federated search and other ML models like LDA, Siamese networks to help CCAs zero in on high quality search results. An intuitive UI designed ground up working with the users (CCAs) is another key feature of the system. AgentBuddy has been deployed internally and initial results from User Acceptance Trials indicate a 4x lift in quality of highlights compared to the incumbent system.},

abstract = {Online shopping has been a habit of more and more people, while most users are unable to craft an informative query, and thus it often takes a long search session to satisfy their purchase intents. We present AliISA - a shopping assistant which offers users some tips to further specify their queries during a search session. With such an interactive search, users tend to find targeted items with fewer page requests, which often means a better user experience. Currently, AliISA assists tens of millions of users per day, earns more usage than existing systems, and consequently brings in a 5% improvement in CVR. In this paper, we present our system, describe the underlying techniques, and discuss our experience in stabilizing reinforcement learning under an E-commerce environment.},

abstract = {Synchronous collaborative search systems (SCSS) refer to systems which support two or more users with similar information need to search together simultaneously. Generally, SCSS provide a social engine to enable users to communicate. However, when the number of users in the social engine is insufficient to collaborate on the search task, the social engine will encounter the cold start problem and can not perform collaborative search well. In this paper, we present a novel Synchronous Collaborative Search System with a Live Interactive Engine (SCSS-LIE). SCSS-LIE proposes to apply a ring topology to add an intelligent auxiliary robot, Infobot, into the social engine to support real-time interaction between users and the search engine to address the cold start problem of the social engine. The reading comprehension model BiDAF (Bi-Directional Attention Flow) is employed in the Infobot in the process of interacting with the search engine to obtain answers to facilitate the acquisition of information. SCSS-LIE can not only allow users with similar information need to be grouped into one chat channel to communicate, but also enable them to conduct real-time interaction with the search engine to improve search efficiency.},

In the CWL framework metrics are specified via a single function which can be used to derive a number of related measurements: Expected Utility per item, Expected Total Utility, Expected Cost per item, Expected Total Cost, and Expected Depth. The CWL framework brings together several independent approaches for measuring the quality of a ranked list, and provides a coherent user model-based framework for developing measures based on utility (gain) and cost. Here we outline the CWL measurement framework; describe the cwl_eval architecture; and provide examples of how to use it. We provide implementations of a number of recent metrics, including Time Biased Gain, U-Measure, Bejewelled Measure, and the Information Foraging Based Measure, as well as previous metrics such as Precision, Average Precision, Discounted Cumulative Gain, Rank-Biased Precision, and INST. By providing state-of-the-art and traditional metrics within the same framework, we promote a standardised approach to evaluating search effectiveness.},

abstract = {This paper introduces TrecTools, a Python library for assisting Information Retrieval (IR) practitioners with TREC-like campaigns. IR practitioners tasked with activities like building test collections, evaluating systems, or analysing results from empirical experiments commonly have to resort to use a number of different software tools and scripts that each perform an individual functionality - and at times they even have to implement ad-hoc scripts of their own. TrecTools aims to provide a unified environment for performing these common activities.Written in the most popular programming language for Data Science, Python, TrecTools offers an object-oriented, easily extensible library. Existing systems, e.g., trec_eval, have considerable barrier to entry when it comes to modify or extend them. Furthermore, many existing IR measures and tools are implemented independently of each other, in different programming languages. TrecTools seeks to lower the barrier to entry and to unify existing tools, frameworks and activities into one common umbrella. Widespread adoption of a centralised solution for developing, evaluating, and analysing TREC-like campaigns will ease the burden on organisers and provide participants and users with a standard environment for common IR experimental activities.TrecTools is distributed as an open source library under the MIT license at https://github.com/joaopalotti/trectools},

abstract = {Traditional forms of education are increasingly being replaced by online forms of learning. With many degrees being awarded without the requirement of co-location, it becomes necessary to build tools to enhance online learning interfaces. Online educational videos are often long and do not have enough metadata. Viewers trying to learn about a particular topic have to go through the entire video to find suitable content. We present a novel architecture to curate content tables for educational videos. We harvest text and acoustic properties of the videos to form a hierarchical content table (similar to a table of contents available in a textbook). We allow users to browse the video smartly by skipping to a particular portion rather than going through the entire video. We consider other text-based approaches as our baselines. We find that our approach beats the macro F1-score and micro F1-score of baseline by 39.45% and 35.76% respectively. We present our demo as an independent web page where the user can paste the URL of the video to obtain a generated hierarchical table of contents and navigate to the required content. In the spirit of reproducibility, we make our code public at https://goo.gl/Qzku9d and provide a screen cast to be viewed at https://goo.gl/4HSV1v.},

This has a number of disadvantages, in terms of training time for new staff members, reliance on external services, and a lack of integration (and hence poor transfer of information) between those services. On the other hand, Event Tracker is a new solution that aims to provide a unified view of an event, integrating information from emergency response officers, the public (via social media) and also volunteers from around the world. In particular, Event Tracker provides a series of novel functionalities to realise this unified view of the event, namely: real-time identification of critical information, automatic grouping of content by the information needs of response officers, as well as real-time volunteers management and communication. This is supported by an efficient and scalable back-end infrastructure designed to ingest and process high-volumes of real-time streaming data with low latency.},

In this demonstration, we present a novel end-to-end visualization system called Kandinsky to supportmulti-faceted visualization of social discussions associated with an anchor post. In Kandinsky, the social discussion landscape is visualized using a collection of colorfulcircles andconcentric circles, which are inspired from the famous abstract arts called"Squares with Concentric Circles" and"Several Circles" by Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944). Intuitively, a circle and a concentric circle represent a social comment and a collection of comments in a discussion thread, respectively. We discuss various innovative features of Kandinsky and demonstrate its effectiveness.},

We propose a system called EXACT for extracting attributed entities from textual documents by performing explorative annotation tasks, which create attributes and bind them to tag values. To support efficient annotation, we propose a novel tag recommendation technique based on a few-shot learning scheme which can suggest tags for new annotation tasks given very few human-annotated samples. We also propose a document recommendation scheme to provide run-time context for the user. Using a novel attribute index, the system can generate the task-relevant attributed entities on-the-fly. We demonstrate how these techniques can be integrated behind a novel user interface to enable productive and efficient extraction of attributed entities at limited cost in human annotation.},

A requirement is a relationship between a set of terms and the document. As requirements become more complex by catering for optional, alternative, and combinations of terms, efficiently retrieving documents becomes more challenging due to the exponential size of the search space. In this paper, we propose RevBoMIR, which utilizes a modified Boolean Model for Information Retrieval to retrieve requirements-based documents without sacrificing the expressiveness of requirements. Our proposed approach is particularly useful in domains where documents embed criteria that can be satisfied by mandatory, alternative or disqualifying terms to determine its retrieval. Finally, we present a graph model for representing document requirements, and demonstrate Requirement Search via a university degree search application.},

abstract = {Choosing a set of items from an inventory is a common problem faced by customers of nearly any retailer. Modern retailers aid and influence customer decisions, using techniques like recommender systems and market basket analysis to deliver personalized and contextual item suggestions. While such methods typically just augment a traditional browsing experience, Stitch Fix goes a step further by exclusively delivering curated selections of items, via algorithmically-assisted stylist recommendations. Our understanding of the human-in-the-loop element in this selection process is crucial to building effective tools to assist stylists in delivering personalized items. When stylists at Stitch Fix select an assortment of clothing for a client, they consider many nuanced relationships between the items, as well as with the client. For example, a stylist may fill a client's request for a work outfit by choosing pants and a blouse that pair well together, as well as fitting the client's stated preferences and her inferred sense of style. This can be described as a contextual subset selection problem, where the goal is to assemble a conditionally optimal set of items, given inventory constraints and context. I will discuss our nonlinear factorization approach},

abstract = {Giving people the power to build community is central to Facebook's mission. Technically, searching for communities poses very different challenges compared to the standard IR problems. First, there is a vocabulary mismatch problem since most of the content of the communities is private. Second, the common labeling strategies based on human ratings and clicks do not work well due to limited public content available to third-party raters and users at search time. Finally, community search has a dual objective of satisfying searchers and growing the number of active communities. While A/B testing is a well known approach for assessing the former, it is an open question on how to measure progress on the latter. This talk discusses these challenges in depth and describes our solution.},

abstract = {As the main revenue source for search engines, sponsored search system retrieves and allocates ads to display on the search result pages. Keyword targeting is widely adopted by most sponsored search systems as the basic model for expressing the advertiser's business and retrieving related ads. In this targeting model, the advertiser should cautiously select lots of keywords relevant to their business to optimize their campaigns, and the sponsored search system retrieves ads based on the relevance between queries and keywords. However, since there is a huge inventory of possible queries and the new queries grow dramatically, it is a great challenge for advertisers to identify and collect lots of relevant bid keywords for their ads, and it also takes great effort to select and maintain high-quality keywords and set corresponding match types for them. In the meantime, the keyword targeting leads to a multi-stage retrieval architecture as it contains the matching between query and keywords and the matching between keywords and ads. The retrieval funnel based on keyword targeting cannot achieve straightforward and optimal matching between search queries and ads. Consequently, traditional keyword targeting method gradually becomes the bottleneck of optimizing advertisers' campaigns and improving the monetization of search ads.In this paper, we present an end-to-end ad retrieval framework for sponsored search. This framework can break the limits of keyword targeting and can achieve direct matching from query to related ads. The framework has been deployed at Baidu's sponsored search system and the experimental result validates its effectiveness. We will describe the design and architecture of this framework, and hope that this framework can give some inspiration for the sponsored search industry.},

Following this trend, we combined DSSM-like architecture with USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models in order to be able to fine-tune them on a small amount of click-through data and use them for information retrieval. This approach allowed us to significantly improve our search engine for statistical data.},

Legal IR is no exception and presents other obstacles, reinforcing the need for innovation and, sometimes, paradigm shifts. Doctrine, one of the largest Legaltech companies in Europe, dedicates an entire data science team to advance on these problems and identify new opportunities. In this presentation, we provide some intuition regarding the specificities of legal IR (e.g., what is relevance?), and we introduce some of the solutions currently used on doctrine.fr.Particularly, we show how we use named entity recognition in the various forms of contents we host, and how it enhances the search engine. With knowledge extracted from documents, we may built large enough datasets and train learning-to-rank algorithms. This, combined with several specific-domain vocabulary enrichments to increase recall, dramatically improves the search experience for our users.},

In this tutorial, we first provide an overview of relevant economic theories, before showing how they can be applied to formulate different ranking principles to provide the optimal ranking to users. This is followed by a session showing how economics can be used to model how people interact with search systems, and how to use these models to generate hypotheses about user behavior. The third session focuses on how economics has been used to underpin the measurement of information retrieval systems and applications using the CWL framework (which reports the expected utility, expected total utility, expected total cost, and so on) -- and how different models of user interaction lead to different metrics. We then show how information foraging theory can be used to measure the performance of an information retrieval system -- connecting the theory of how people search with how we measure it. The final session of the day will be spent building economic models and measures of search. Here sample problems will be provided to challenge participants, or participants can bring their own.},

abstract = {Exploration is one of the primordial ways to accrue knowledge about the world and its nature. As we accumulate, mostly automatically, data at unprecedented volumes and speed, our datasets have become complex and hard to understand. In this context, exploratory search provides a handy tool for progressively gather the necessary knowledge by starting from a tentative query that can provide cues about the next queries to issue. An exploratory query should be simple enough to avoid complicate declarative languages (such as SQL) and convoluted mechanism, and at the same time retain the flexibility and expressiveness required to express complex information needs. Recently, we have witnessed a rediscovery of the so called example-based methods, in which the user, or the analyst circumvent query languages by using examples as input. This shift in semantics has led to a number of methods receiving as query a set of example members of the answer set. The search system then infers the entire answer set based on the given examples and any additional information provided by the underlying database. In this tutorial, we present an excursus over the main example-based methods for exploratory analysis. We show how different data types require different techniques, and present algorithms that are specifically designed for relational, textual, and graph data. We conclude by providing a unifying view of this query-paradigm and identify new exciting research directions.},

abstract = {Quantification (also known as "supervised prevalence estimation" [2], or "class prior estimation" [7]) is the task of estimating, given a set σ of unlabelled items and a set of classes C = c1, . . . , c |C| , the relative frequency (or "prevalence") p(ci ) of each class ci C, i.e., the fraction of items in σ that belong to ci . When each item belongs to exactly one class, since 0 ≤ p(ci ) ≤ 1 and \'{I} ci C p(ci ) = 1, p is a distribution of the items in σ across the classes in C (the true distribution), and quantification thus amounts to estimating p (i.e., to computing a predicted distribution p?).Quantification is important in many disciplines (such as e.g., market research, political science, the social sciences, and epidemiology) which usually deal with aggregate (as opposed to individual) data. In these contexts, classifying individual unlabelled instances is usually not a primary goal, while estimating the prevalence of the classes of interest in the data is. For instance, when classifying the tweets about a certain entity (e.g., a political candidate) as displaying either a Positive or a Negative stance towards the entity, we are usually not much interested in the class of a specific tweet: instead, we usually want to know the fraction of these tweets that belong to the class [14].},

abstract = {eCommerce Information Retrieval is receiving increasing attention in the academic literature, and is an essential component of some of the largest web sites (such as eBay, Amazon, Airbnb, Alibaba, Taobao, Target, Facebook, Home Depot, and others). These kinds of organisations clearly value the importance of research into Information Retrieval. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, to set a research agenda, to examine how to build data sets, and how evaluate algorithms for research into this fascinating topic. eCommerce IR is ripe for research and has a unique set of problems. For example, in eCommerce search there may be no hypertext links between documents (products); there is a click stream, but more importantly, there is often a buy stream. eCommerce problems are wide in scope and range from user interaction modalities through to dynamic updates of a rapidly changing collection on auction sites, and the experienceness of some products (such as Airbnb bookings). This workshop is a follow up to very successful workshops held at SIGIR 2017 and SIGIR 2018. This year we will be running a data challenge (sponsored by eBay) which will allow us to follow up on multiple aspects that were discussed in the previous workshops (in particular, deterministic rank orders and how to evaluate these).},

abstract = {The journalism industry has undergone a revolution in the past decade, leading to new opportunities as well as challenges. News consumption, production and delivery have all been affected and transformed by technology Readers require new mechanisms to cope with the vast volume of information in order to be informed about news events. Reporters have begun to use natural language processing (NLP) and (IR) techniques for investigative work. Publishers and aggregators are seeking new business models, and new ways to reach and retain their audience. A shift in business models has led to a gradual shift in styles of journalism in attempts to increase page views; and, far more concerning, to real mis- and dis-information, alongside allegations of "fake news" threatening the journalistic freedom and integrity of legitimate news outlets. Social media platforms drive viewership, creating filter bubbles and an increasingly polarized readership. News documents have always been a part of research on information access and retrieval methods. Over the last few years, the IR community has increasingly recognized these challenges in journalism and opened a conversation about how we might begin to address them. Evidence of this recognition is the participation in the two previous editions of our NewsIR workshop, held in ECIR 2016 and 2018. One of the most important outcomes of those workshops is an increasing awareness in the community about the changing nature of journalism and the IR challenges it entails. To move yet another step forward, the goal of the third edition of our workshop will be to create a multidisciplinary venue that brings together news experts from both technology and journalism. This would take NewsIR from a European forum targeting mainly IR researchers, into a more inclusive and influential international forum. We hope that this new format will foster further understanding for both news professionals and IR researchers, as well as producing better outcomes for news consumers. We will address the possibilities and challenges that technology offers to the journalists, the challenges that new developments in journalism create for IR researchers, and the complexity of information access tasks for news readers.},

At different stages of search, users' search strategies are often influenced by different search intentions, encountered problems, as well as knowledge states. In previous studies, information seeking and interactive IR researchers have developed and validated some frameworks for describing various task facets and features. However, few studies have explored how to depict and differentiate different stages or states of complex search tasks in a comprehensive, multidimensional manner. The existing theoretical models of search process offer limited contributions to search path evaluation and the design of system recommendations for users at different states. To address this issue at both theoretical and empirical levels, my dissertation aims to construct an explainable framework that can characterize the stages or states of complex search tasks over multiple dimensions and to apply the framework in proactive search path evaluation and recommendation.},

Some of these are due to, essentially, ranking competitions between document authors who modify them in response to rankings induced for queries of interest so as to rank-promote the documents. One unwarranted consequence is that rankings can rapidly change due to small, almost indiscernible changes, of documents. In recent work, we addressed the issue of ranking robustness under (adversarial) document manipulations for feature-based learning-to-rank approaches. We presented a formalism of different notions of ranking robustness that gave rise to a few theoretical findings. Empirical evaluation provided support to these findings. Our next goals are to devise learning-to-rank techniques for optimizing relevance and robustness simultaneously, study the connections between ranking robustness and fairness, and to devise additional testbeds for evaluating ranking robustness.},

Users search for various kinds of events such as political events, organizational announcements, policy changes, personal events, criminal activity and so on. In linguistics, events are often thought of as discourse entities with associated complex structure and attributes.Many professionals look for patterns that involve event occurrences. Journalists, financial analysts, intelligence analysts, attorneys conducting investigations, auditors examining corporate records are examples of users who may want to find such information and to arrange it in ways that can help to produce meaningful analyses.The goal of this work is to develop effective information retrieval systems that can help users to satisfy event-related information needs. My particular interest is in events that are decomposable into subevents in ways that can be anticipated. I am interested in modeling decomposable events, and in automatically recognizing references to subevents, both to help with finding relevant documents and to help with presenting diverse results to the user.I plan to pursue this broader goal in three stages, each of which involves creating a test collection. I have started by developing information retrieval test collections for news, building on existing collections of news stories from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) and the Topic Detection and Tracking Evaluations [1]. Next, I plan to build a new event ontology for email, and use that ontology as a basis for building an information retrieval collection from the Avocado Email collection. Finally, I plan to extend one or both of these test collections to support research on characterizing event impact, thus perhaps providing an additional basis for ranking.In each stage of my work, new test collection(s) will enable new research. In my first stage, which is in progress, I have studied the effect of automatically detected subevents on ranking effectiveness. Using the Rich Entities, Relations and Events (ERE) ontology of event types and subtypes from the TAC Event track [5], and two existing automated event detection systems, I have developed a simple bag of words-and-events search system that uses the automatically detected event type information. I also built an information retrieval test collection from a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) collection, for which event-based topics exist. Evaluation results show promise when compared to baseline approaches. I plan to further develop this line of work to identify ways to automatically decompose high level events into their components.With the goal of extending the event retrieval work to an organizational setting, in my second line of research I plan to work with the Avocado email collection [3]. While newswire text and other Web pages are easily available for everyone's perusal, email content is interesting because it may contain organizational and personal events that differ from those found in news, and those events may be referred to in less fully contextualized ways. In this line of research, I want to build a retrieval system for events in this genre of personal and organizational content. The retrieval system will provide a diverse ranking covering the full range of subevents for which information is available. To do this, I will need a reusable test collection containing event-related topics, with the event nuggets within those documents annotated for relevance. This annotation at the event nugget level will support computing measures like α-nDCG [2] in which the gain reflects in part the number of different event nuggets in a document.The third stage of my work will be more exploratory, since there are many ways in which one might conceptualize event impact. My initial approach will be to explore alternative indicators for different types of impact. For example, the societal impact of news stories might be characterized by the number of readers, whereas the personal impact of an email might be characterized by the time before a reply is received. I am particularly interested in how sentiment analysis might be used to characterize event impact, particularly with reference to publicly available user-generated content.},

abstract = {Linking phrases to knowledge base entities is a process known as entity linking and has already been widely explored for various content types such as tweets. A major step in entity linking is to recognize and/or classify phrases that can be disambiguated and linked to knowledge base entities, i.e., Named Entity Recognition and Classification. Unlike common entity recognition and linking systems, however, we aim to recognize, classify, and link entities which are implicitly mentioned, and hence lack a surface form, to appropriate knowledge base entries. In other words, the objective of our work is to recognize and identify core entities of a tweet when those entities are not explicitly mentioned; this process is referred to as Implicit Named Entity Recognition and Linking.},

abstract = {Digitized world demands data integration systems that combine data repositories from multiple data sources. Vast amounts of clinical and biomedical research data are considered a primary force enabling data-driven research toward advancing health research and for introducing efficiencies in healthcare delivery. Data-driven research may have many goals, including but not limited to improved diagnostics processes, novel biomedical discoveries, epidemiology, and education. However, finding and gaining access to relevant data remains an elusive goal. We identified these challenges and developed an Integrated Radiology Image Search (IRIS) framework that could be a step toward aiding data-driven research. We propose building data bridges to support retrieving ranked relevant documents from integrated repository. My research focuses on biomedical data integration and indexing systems and provide ranked document retrieval from an integrated repository. Though we currently focus on integrating biomedical data sources (for medical professionals), we believe that our proposed framework and methodologies can be used in other domains as well.},

abstract = {Thinking in terms of an information need instead of simply queries provides a rich set of new opportunities in improving the effectiveness of search [6]. User queries may vary a lot for a single information need [3, 9], as a query is often under-specified. Many techniques have been proposed to enrich a single query, for example relevance modeling [8]. These techniques focus on improving overall system performance but may fail in some occasions. Instead of optimizing for a single query, another direction is to use multiple query variations to represent an information need. With fusion techniques, query variations can improve system performance while failing fewer queries [2, 6].Using query variations is a simple and appealing idea, but collecting them is a manually intensive task. Existing high quality query variations are collected from crowd-sourcing workers and domain experts [1]. Therefore the process cannot be automated and deployed in a production system. Researchers have investigated random walks on click graphs [5] and relevance models [4] to automatically generate query variations, but experiments show that there is still a big gap between automatic variations and human generated ones. In this PhD project,we focus on automatic query variation generation and try to reduce the gap to human generated variations.We plan to leverage advances of transfer learning and classic relevance modeling to generate high quality query variations to improve system performance.},

abstract = {Language understanding is multimodal. During human communication, messages are conveyed not only by words in textual form, but also through speech patterns, gestures or facial emotions of the speakers. Therefore, it is crucial to fuse information from different modalities to achieve a joint comprehension.With the rapid progress in the deep learning field, neural networks have emerged as the most popular approach for addressing multimodal data fusion [1, 6, 7, 12]. While these models can effectively combine multimodal features by learning from data, they nevertheless lack an explicit exhibition of how different modalities are related to each other, due to the inherent low interpretability of neural networks [2].In the meantime, Quantum Theory (QT) has given rise to principled approaches for incorporating interactions between textual features into a holistic textual representation [3, 5, 8, 10], where the concepts of superposition andentanglement have been universally exploited to formulate interactions. The advantages of those models in capturing complicated correlations between textual features have been observed.We hereby propose the research on quantum-inspired multimodal data fusion, claiming that the limitation of multimodal data fusion can be tackled by quantum-driven models. In particular, we propose to employ superposition to formulate intra-modal interactions while the interplay between different modalities is expected to be captured by entanglement measures. By doing so, the interactions within multimodal data may be rendered explicitly in a unified quantum formalism, increasing the performance and interpretability for concrete multimodal tasks. It will also expand the application domains of quantum theory to multimodal tasks where only preliminary efforts have been made [11]. We therefore aim at answering the following research question:RQ. Can we fuse multimodal data with quantum-inspired models?To answer this question, we propose to fuse multimodal data with complex-valued neural networks, motivated by the theoretical link between neural networks and quantum theory [4] and advances in complex-valued neural networks [9]. Our model begins with a separate complex-valued embedding learned for each unimodal data based on the existing works [5, 10] which inherently assumes superposition between intra-modal features. Then we construct a many-body system in entangled state for multimodal data, where cross-modality interactions are naturally reflected by entanglement measures. Quantum measurement operators are applied to the entanglement state to address a concrete multimodal task at hand. The whole process is instrumented by a complex-valued neural network, which is able to learn how multimodal features are combined from data, and at the same time explain the combination by means of quantum superposition and entanglement measures.We plan to examine our proposed models on CMU-MOSI [12] and CMU-MOSEI [1] which are benchmarking multimodal sentiment analysis datasets. The dataset targets at classifying sentiment into 2, 5 or 7 classes with the input of textual, visual and acoustic features. We expect to see comparable effectiveness to state-of-the-art models, and we will explore superposition and entanglement measures to better understand the inter-modal interactions.},

abstract = {Visualization of inter-document similarities is widely used for the exploration of document collections and interactive retrieval. However, similarity relationships between documents are multifaceted and measured distances by a given metric often do not match the perceived similarity of human beings. Furthermore, the user's notion of similarity can drastically change with the exploration objective or task at hand. Therefore, this research proposes to investigate online adjustments to the similarity model using feedback generated during exploration or exploratory search. In this course, rich visualizations and interactions will support users to give valuable feedback. Based on this, metric learning methodologies will be applied to adjust a similarity model in order to improve the exploration experience. At the same time, trained models are considered as valuable outcomes whose benefits for similarity-based tasks such as query-by-example retrieval or classification will be tested.},

abstract = {Users of online job search websites interact with ranked lists of job summaries generated in response to queries, hoping to identify one or more jobs of interest. Hence, the quality of job search rankings becomes a primary factor that affects user satisfaction. In this work, we propose methodologies and measures for evaluating the quality of job search rankings from a user modeling perspective. We start by investigating job seekers' behavior when they are interacting with the generated rankings, leveraging job search interaction logs from Seek.com, a well-known Australasian job search website. The output of this investigation will be an accurate model of job seekers that will be incorporated into an effectiveness metric. Recent proposals for job search ranking models used using two types of metrics to evaluate the quality of the ranking generated by the models: (1) offline metrics, such as NDCG@k (k is set to the number of job summaries shown in the first page), Prec@1, or Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR); and (2) online metrics, such as click-through rate and job application rate [3, 6].},

In our research, we investigate the completeness of existing theoretical frameworks in explaining conversational search data propose modifications to such systems. The linear and transient nature of speech makes it cognitively challenging for the user to process a large amount of information. We propose a study to evaluate the users' preference of modalities when using conversational search systems. The study will help us to understand how results should be presented in a conversational search system. As we observe how users search using audio queries, interact with the intermediary, and process the results presented, we aim to develop an insight on how to present results more efficiently in a conversational search setting. We also plan on exploring the effectiveness and consistency of different media in a conversational search setting. Our observations will inform future designs and help to create a better understanding of such systems.},

In my Ph.D. research, I address the two problems with the development of an unsupervised method for the computation of informative samples. The informative samples are first manually labeled and then used for both: The training of the initial active learning model and the training of the human annotators in form of a learning-by-doing session. The planned unsupervised method will be based on word-embeddings and it will be limited to the area of text classification.},

abstract = {Most existing approaches that use social media for detecting and characterizing emerging crisis events are based on the analysis of messages obtained from social platforms using a predetermined set of keywords [2, 3]. In addition to keyword filters, messages must commonly be post-processed using supervised classification models to determine if messages are referring to a real-time crisis situation or not. However, keyword-based approaches have certain shortcomings; on the one hand they require specific domain knowledge of different crisis events to determine a set of keywords to filter relevant data about an emerging crisis situation; on the other hand, they require supervised methods to determine if the identified data actually corresponds to a new real-time crisis event. Hence, the creation of keyword-independent methods could also help generalize existing approaches so they can be used for cross-lingual events, since each language and culture can have its own particular terms to refer to a same event. The majority of these works also explain phenomenons just for English messages. This limitation avoids replication of methodologies in other languages and countries where emergency events often occur. For this reason, researchers recently have focused on creating domain-independent and multi-lingual approaches for detecting and classifying social media messages during crisis events [1, 4]. These approaches have exploited low-level lexical features with the goal of reaching domain-transfer among different crisis events and languages. Nonetheless, most studies focused on crisis-related messages without testing non related crisis messages such as sporting events or music festivals.The main objective of this work is to study and exploit cross-lingual domain-independent patterns for detecting and characterizing social media messages generated in collective activity related to unexpected high-impact real-world events in social media platforms, and specifically on emergency situations. The expected contribution is to develop novel techniques in order to provide multi-lingual and domain-independent detections, and characterizations of emergency situations. Such techniques should help us better understand the social media behavior during crises in affected locations around the world, independent of their language, domain and type of event. Some of these patterns arise independently of the particular type or domain of the crisis event, as well as independent of the location, language and culture of the users that participate. Hence, our hypothesis is that there are patterns in the self-organized activity of the Web and social media users that emerge when a crisis situation starts to unfold in the physical world. Some of these patterns arise independently of the particular type or domain of the crisis event, as well as independent of the location, language and culture of the users that participate. We then propose the following research questions:RQ1: Can we characterize collective patterns during crisis situations independently of their language and domain based on non-textual and low-level lexical features?RQ2: Are there differences among types of emergency situations (instantaneous, progressives, focalized and diffused) related to social media messages posted during these events?RQ3: Are non-textual and low-level lexical features sufficient at reducing the number of non-related emergency situations detected as crises in the Web and social media?},
