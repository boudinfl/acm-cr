abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing number of questions about the relationship between preprints and double-blind peer-review at the SIGIR conference. These questions come from authors who wish to post papers which are under review to preprint servers such as arXiv.org, as well as reviewers who become aware of author identities through such postings, and are subsequently, unsure of how to proceed in a double-blind review process. A review of current conference publication guidelines was conducted, along with a survey of SIGIR community members to gain insight about their behaviors, practices and opinions. The paper presents results of this survey, as well as recommendations about submission and review policies for the SIGIR conference.},

abstract = {In the last few years there have been the explosion in the use of heterogeneous distributed systems. Ranging from simple Network of Workstations to the more modern and complex Grid systems, the adoption of distributed systems instead of massively parallel supercomputers has been preferred due to their reduced cost of ownership. These kinds of systems pose many challenges in terms of information access, storage and retrieval. Usually, in fact, instead of having collections stored at a single site they are collected, and sometimes managed, at different sites (possibly owned by different institutions). Particular interest has been expressed on architectures and specifications for information retrieval in the context of heterogeneous distributed computing systems.},

abstract = {The SIGIR 2005 workshop program included seven workshops that were competitively selected from among eight proposals. Organizers of SIGIR 2004 workshops had reported that tight timelines for publicizing workshops and reviewing submissions had resulted in some workshop participants not being notified that a workshop paper had been accepted until the deadline for registration at regular prices had passed. The submission date for SIGIR 2005 workshop proposals was therefore advanced to occur one week after full papers were due. Expedited reviews of all workshop proposals were performed by a committee consisting of recent workshops chairs, augmented where necessary with additional reviewers to ensure that expertise in the topic of each workshop proposal was available. The review results were summarized in an email to the organizing committee and area chairs, and decisions were made by the PC chairs after an email discussion. Workshop organizers were notified of their selection shortly after the poster deadline, about 5 weeks earlier than in previous years. As a result, workshop organizers were generally able to solicit and review submissions sufficiently rapidly to permit workshop participants to qualify for discounted early registration rates.},

Some retrieval approaches work well on one topic but poorly on a second, while other approaches may work poorly on the first topic, but succeed on the second. If it could be determined in advance which approach would work well, then a guided approach could strongly improve performance.

SIGs are not required to implement badging, but given the growing interest in this topic in the SIGIR community, a task force has been assembled to determine how badging might be implemented.

abstract = {Searchers with a complex information need typically slice-and-dice their problem into several queries and subqueries, and laboriously combine the answers post hoc to solve their tasks. Consider planning a social event at the last day of SIGIR, in the unknown city of Beijing, factoring in distances, timing, and preferences on budget, cuisine, and entertainment. A system supporting the entire search episode should "know" a lot, either from profiles or implicit information, or from explicit information in the query or from feedback. This may lead to the (interactive) construction of a complexly structured query, but sometimes the most obvious query for a complex need is dead simple: entertain me. Rather than returning ten-blue-lines in response to a 2.4-word query, the desired system should support searchers during their whole task or search episode, by iteratively constructing a complex query or search strategy, by exploring the result-space at every stage, and by combining the partial answers into a coherent whole.The workshop brought together a varied group of researchers covering both user and system centered approaches, who worked together on the problem and potential solutions. There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. First, there was general optimism on the wealth of contextual information that can be derived from context or natural interactions without the need for obstrusive explicit feedback. Second, the task of "contextual suggestions"--matching specific types of results against rich profiles--was identified as a manageable first step, and concrete plans for such as track were discussed in the aftermath of the workshop. Third, the identified dimensions of variation--such as the level of engagement, or user versus system initiative--give clear suggestions of the types of input a searcher is willing or able to give and the type of response expected from a system.},

The purpose of the workshop was to serve as a platform for publication and discussion of Information Retrieval and NLP research and their applications in the domain of eCommerce. The workshop program was designed to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia and industry to discuss the challenges and approaches to product search and recommendation in the eCommerce domain. Another goal of the workshop was to examine the building of a benchmark data set to facilitate research into this topic. The workshop drew contributions from both industry as well as academia, in total the workshop received a total of twenty one submissions, and accepted thirteen papers. In addition to presentation of a subset of accepted submissions, the workshop had two keynotes by invited speakers from the industry, a poster session where all the accepted submissions were presented, a breakout session, a panel discussion, and a group discussion.},

From this we determined, using information retrieval approaches of course, which topics had come and gone over the last two and a half decades, and which topics are currently "hot". We also performed a co-authorship analysis among authors of the 853 SIGIR conference papers to determine which author is the most "central" in terms of a co-authorship graph and is our equivalent of Paul Erd\"{o}s in Mathematics. In the first section we report on the content analysis, leading to our prediction as to the most topical paper likely to appear at SIGIR2003. In the second section we present details of our co-authorship analysis, revealing who is the "Christopher Lee" of SIGIR, and in the final section we give pointers to where readers who are SIGIR conference paper authors may find details of where they fit into the coauthorship graph.},

Therefore the purpose of the MF/IR 2002, which was the third in row, workshop was, on the one hand, to continue and enhance the results obtained so far, and on the other hand, to present, discuss, analyze, integrate the newer/newest results. MF/IR 2002 also aimed at promoting discussion and interaction among those with theoretical and applicative research interests in mathematical/formal aspects of Information Retrieval, and also at being a forum for the presentation of both theoretical and applicative results (e.g., foundational issues; description and/or integration of models; retrieval applications; mathematical/formal techniques, properties and structures in IR; existing and/or new theories and theoretical aspects).The following areas were addressed: Information Retrieval, Information Filtering, Information, Mining, Indexing and Retrieval, Hypermedia, World Wide Web Retrieval, Digital Libraries, Evaluation, Human Computer Interaction, User Modeling, Semantic Web and Ontologies, where the different entities involved (e.g., documents, queries, indexing, retrieval, relevance, effectiveness, users, etc.) were modeled using any of, but not necessarily limited to, the following approaches: Classical Sets, Fuzzy Sets, Rough Sets, Vectors, Linear Space, Similarity Functions, Probability, Theory of Uncertainty, Functional Analysis, Algebra, Topology, Metric Spaces, Euclidean Geometry, Non-Euclidean Geometries, Boolean Logic, Non-standard Logics, Fuzzy Logic, Quantum Logic, Matroid Theory, Graph Theory.},

The P2P paradigm holds many promises: it fits naturally with the Internet, the universal knowledge and service exchange medium; it favors scalability, by allowing the seamless plugging of data, services and computational resources into the global system; it increases system resilience, by avoiding unique points of failures; and it can speed up global access by distributing the indexing and query processing tasks to multiple computing nodes. However, retrieval methods for P2P systems are still in their infancy. P2P networks are prone to congestion when messages are not routed intelligently. Many of the most effective routing or data placement methods developed recently rely on relatively simple retrieval methods and homogeneous network environments.},

The goal of the Neu-IR (pronounced "New IR") workshop was to serve as a forum for academic and industrial researchers, working at the intersection of information retrieval (IR) and machine learning, to present new work and early results, compare notes on neural network toolkits, share best practices, and discuss the main challenges facing this line of research. In total, 19 papers were presented, including oral and poster presentations. The workshop program also included a session on invited "lightning talks" to encourage participants to share personal insights and negative results with the community. The workshop was well-attended with more than 120 registrations.},

abstract = {The use of contexts --side information associated to information tasks-- has been one of the most important dimensions for the improvement of Information Retrieval tasks, helping to clarify the information needs of the users which usually start from a few keywords in a text box. Particularly, the social context has been leveraged in search and personalization since the inception of the Social Web, but even today we find new scenarios of information filtering, search, recommendation and personalization where the use of social signals can produce a steep improvement. In addition, the action of searching has become a social process on the Web, making traditional assumptions of relevance obsolete and requiring new paradigms for matching the most useful resources that solve information needs. This escenario has motivated us for organizing the Social Personalization and Search (SPS) workshop, a forum aimed at sharing and discussing research that leverage social data for improving classic personalization models for information access and to revisiting search from individual phenomena to a collaborative process.},

abstract = {All search in the real-world is inherently interactive. Information retrieval (IR) has a firm tradition of using simulation to evaluate IR systems as embodied by the Cranfield paradigm. However, to a large extent, such system evaluations ignore user interaction. Simulations provide a way to go beyond this limitation. With an increasing number of researchers using simulation to evaluate interactive IR systems, it is now timely to discuss, develop and advance this powerful methodology within the field of IR. During the SimInt 2010 workshop around 40 participants discussed and presented their views on the simulation of interaction. The main conclusion and general consensus was that simulation offers great potential for the field of IR; and that simulations of user interaction can make explicit the user and the user interface while maintaining the advantages of the Cranfield paradigm.},

abstract = {Modern Web data is highly structured in terms of entities and relations from large knowledge resources, geo-temporal references and social network structure, resulting in a massivemultidimensional graph. This graph essentially unifies both the searcher and the information resources that played a fundamentally different role in traditional IR, and "Graph Search" offers major new ways to access relevant information. Graph search affects both query formulation (complex queries about entities and relations building on the searcher's context) as well as result exploration and discovery (slicing and dicing the information using the graph structure) in a completely personalized way. This new graph based approach introduces great opportunities, but also great challenges, in terms of data quality and data integration, user interface design, and privacy.We view the notion of "graph search" as searching information from your personal point of view (you are the query) over a highly structured and curated information space. This goes beyond the traditional two-term queries and ten blue links results that users are familiar with, requiring a highly interactive session covering both query formulation and result exploration. The workshop brought together researchers from a range of areas in information access, who worked together on searching information from your personal point of view over a highly structured and curated information space.},

abstract = {The previous workshop on "XML and Information Retrieval" was held in the context of SIGIR'2000 (Athens, Greece) and showed that there is a serious interest in managing semi-structured data from an IR (i.e., unstructured) perspective rather than from the dominating database (i.e., structured) perspective. As a direct outcome of the workshop, a special JASIS issue on XML and IR was edited and published in March 2002. The topic is still in its prime both in the Academia, as evidenced by XML related papers presented at SIGIR'2001, and in the business world with more search engines adding "XML support" as a requirement.The purpose of this workshop was to continue the effort of applying an "IR approach" to XML search and retrieval. We believe that this approach is crucial to extending the role of XML from pure data exchange in business-to-business applications to actual information exchange in end-users facing and Knowledge Management applications. As a side issue, we also intended to ask the IR community how it should relate, if at all, to the XQuery initiative at W3C. The workshop included 3 presentation sessions, for a total of 8 reviewed papers, an invited talk and a panel. The workshop attracted an audience of more than 30 people, who were encouraged to interact with the speakers as well as the audience.},

The importance of information access and information processing in industry and academia is growing in a revolutionary way, making the discussion on fundamental and long term aspects, and their relation to short term success and failure, more urgent than ever before. To highlight the increasingly strong connections between Information Retrieval and its neighboring disciplines, ICTIR'17 explicitly welcomed papers in IR areas that overlap with Human Information Access, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Perception. ICTIR'17 in Amsterdam was a memorable conference. For those who like numbers: we had 142 attendees (biggest ICTIR ever), and 97 submissions with 52 accepted (largest ICTIR ever), 450/250 euro registration for everything (cheapest ICTIR ever), and for the first time in history the organization and keynotes of a leading IR conference where majority female (but selected for being outstanding researchers, of course).},

The aim of the workshop was to bring together researchers in NLP and IR to discuss the use of lexical cohesion in text applications, such as document and passage retrieval, question answering, topic segmentation and text summarization. There were a number of related workshops in the past: MEMURA 2004 Workshop on Methodologies and Evaluation of Multiword Units in Real-World Applications in association with the 4th International Conference on Language Resources (LREC 2004) [1], Multiword Expressions: Integrating Processing Workshop in association with the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2004) [2], and Multiword Expressions: Analysis, Acquisition and Treatment Workshop in association with the 41st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2003) [3]. The goal of this workshop was to address a wider range of lexical cohesion phenomena in text, not only multiword units, but also relations between words on the sentence, passage and document level, and how they can be useful for information retrieval applications.},

The goal of the workshop, co-chaired by Baeza-Yates and Maarek, was to complement the INEX (Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval) meetings that have been organized for the last two years, by providing researchers a useful forum for discussing (before implementing) and evaluating their models at INEX in the second half of the year. Our intent was twofold: first encourage the exchanges of ideas between researchers who are now active in this "sub-field" and, second, attract new interests. Our focus, like in previous editions of the workshop, was to address issues related to the application of IR methods to XML data for querying, retrieval, navigating, etc. We have gone a long way since the first edition in 2000, when XML was entirely dominated by the DB community. However, it seems that the expected breakthrough has not occurred yet, and it is not clear whether it is for lack of XML data, of appropriate technology, or simply of real needs in the marketplace.},

The workshop included a mixture of short introductions to selected NP methods, paper presentations and a panel discussion by invited scholars. Each session included significant time allotted to open discussions among the participants. The high attendance and the lively discussions demonstrated significant interest in the use of NP methods in information retrieval research. The panel and discussions pointed out many advantages of using these methods as a data source complementary to traditional measures but also potentially offering deeper insights into humans interacting with information. Significant challenges, such as the lack of baseline data and reference tasks, and a need to collaborate with neuroscientists, were also noted. Overall, the NP-methods were found to be very promising and worth continued research efforts.},

CAIR'17 brought together academic and industry researchers to present and discuss new research on conversational approaches to search, particularly over speech. As speech interfaces to devices are becoming more pervasive, and with the advent of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), investigating and designing more effective and efficient means of interacting with information sources and search engines is growing in importance. Spoken interfaces to search engines opens opportunities through the possibility of greater interactivity but also requires rethinking, e.g., how results are presented. CAIR'17 addressed a range of such issues via invited keynote presentations, research papers presented orally and via posters, and a panel discussion involving researchers from interactive IR, IR evaluation, and spoken dialogue systems.},

The retrieval of such information will depend on time, place, history of interaction, task in hand, and a range of other factors that are not given explicitly but are implicit in the interaction and ambient environment, namely the context. IR research is now conducted in multimedia, multi-lingual, and multi-modal environments but largely out of context (Jarvelin &amp; Ingwersen, 2004; Ingwersen &amp; Jarvelin, forthcoming). However, such contextual data can be used effectively to constrain retrieval of information thereby reducing the complexity of the retrieval process. To achieve this, context models for different modalities will need to be developed so that they can be deployed effectively to enhance retrieval performance. Thus truly context-aware and -dependent retrieval will become feasible.},

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs docum-ent clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {We present a framework for information retrieval that combines document models and query models using a probabilistic ranking function based on Bayesian decision theory. The framework suggests an operational retrieval model that extends recent developments in the language modeling approach to information retrieval. A language model for each document is estimated, as well as a language model for each query, and the retrieval problem is cast in terms of risk minimization. The query language model can be exploited to model user preferences, the context of a query, synonomy and word senses. While recent work has incorporated word translation models for this purpose, we introduce a new method using Markov chains defined on a set of documents to estimate the query models. The Markov chain method has connections to algorithms from link analysis and social networks. The new approach is evaluated on TREC collections and compared to the basic language modeling approach and vector space models together with query expansion using Rocchio. Significant improvements are obtained over standard query expansion methods for strong baseline TF-IDF systems, with the greatest improvements attained for short queries on Web data.},

abstract = {Most previous investigations comparing the performance of different representations have used recall and precision as performance measures. However, there is evidence to show that these measures are insensitive to an important difference between representations. To explain, two representations may perform similarly on these measures, while retrieving very different sets of documents. Equivalence of representations should be decided on the basis of similarity in performance and similarity in the documents retrieved. This study compared the performance of four representations in the PsycAbs database. In addition, overlap between retrieved sets was also computed where overlap is the proportion of retrieved documents that are the same for pairs of document representations. Results indicate that for any two representations considered, performance values differed slightly while overlap scores were also low, thus supporting the evidence that recall and precision as performance measures mask differences between the sets of retrieved documents. Results are interpreted to propose an optimal ordering of the representations and to examine the contribution of each representation given this combination.},

These results indicate that while the absolute performance of a search on a particular collection is dependent on the palrwise similarity of the relevant documents, the relative effectiveness of clustered retrieval versus sequential retrieval is independent of this factor. However, retrieval of entire clusters in response to a query usually results in a poorer performance than retrieval of individual documents from clusters.},

The central ingredient in this approach is a statistical model of how a user might distill or "translate" a given document into a query. To assess the relevance of a document to a user's query, we estimate the probability that the query would have been generated as a translation of the document, and factor in the user's general preferences in the form of a prior distribution over documents. We propose a simple, well motivated model of the document-to-query translation process, and describe an algorithm for learning the parameters of this model in an unsupervised manner from a collection of documents. As we show, one can view this approach as a generalization and justification of the "language modeling" strategy recently proposed by Ponte and Croft. In a series of experiments on TREC data, a simple translation-based retrieval system performs well in comparison to conventional retrieval techniques. This prototype system only begins to tap the full potential of translation-based retrieval.},

This report presents the motivation, output, and research challenges of the second DATA:SEARCH workshop which was held in conjunction with SIGIR 2018, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This workshop explored challenges in data search, with a particular focus on data on the web. The aim was to share and establish links between different perspectives on search and discovery for different kinds of structured data, which can potentially inform the design of a wide range of information retrieval technologies. The DATA:SEARCH workshop tries to bring together communities interested in making the web of data more discoverable, easier to search and more user friendly.},

abstract = {Language modeling approaches to information retrieval are attractive and promising because they connect the problem of retrieval with that of language model estimation, which has been studied extensively in other application areas such as speech recognition. The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A core problem in language model estimation is smoothing, which adjusts the maximum likelihood estimator so as to correct the inaccuracy due to data sparseness. In this paper, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collection.},

abstract = {IR and OCR have largely developed independent standards and metrics, with OCR focused on literal accuracy, and IR focused on essential "content/meaning". With more and more media not only paper, but in multiple image formats, the opportunities and challenges for OCR on new formats -- video and still images -- are enormous. While OCR is assessed in metrics that emphasize words and characters, IR has learned to apply end-to-end metrics that ask whether the needs of the users can be met by existing systems. The same considerations apply also to the problem of providing permanent worldwide access to millions of pages of legacy print documents, representing the shared human record as it existed until just a few years ago.The International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) has held a series of Document Recognition and Retrieval (DRR) conferences. The tenth, DRR X will be held in January 2003, in Santa Clara California. In 2001, Dan LoPresti of Bell Labs decided that the area would benefit from more intense collaboration between those who specialize in finding the words on a page image, and those researchers who know how to find the right documents, given the words. He invited Paul Kantor (Rutgers) to join the DRR Chairs, and together they invited Dave Lewis (Consultant) to give a keynote address at DRR VIII. Dan then stepped down. Paul chaired DRR IX (2002) and then handed the reins to Tapas Kanungo (IBM, Almaden) and together they invited Jamie Callan (CMU), David Grossman (IIT) and Alex Hauptmann (CMU) to join the conference committee for DRR X.To improve communication between SIGIR and DRR, this group proposed a SIGIR workshop on this area. The workshop on "Information Retrieval and OCR: From Converting Content to Grasping Meaning" was intended to stimulate cross-fertilization between OCR and IR, in hopes that better use of IR will enable the OCR community to avoid expensive hand processing, and to demonstrate that the combination of present static and dynamic image processing and present state-of-the-art robust information retrieval can generate substantial advances in both extraction of messages from image streams and conversion of existing paper variants. It solicited papers dealing with future applications, such as the indexing and retrieval of text embedded in static or video graphic images, with problems of skew, distortion, and obscuration, as well as state-of-the-art discussions of the storage and retrieval of handwritten or print legacy materials.The workshop was held on August 15, 2002 in Tampere, Finland, immediately following the SIGIR 2002 conference. Although the workshop was intended to appeal to a wide range of IR and OCR researchers (and indeed was proposed at the request of colleagues from the OCR community), it primarily drew people with a background in IR. About a dozen people participated. The small size allowed a very interactive, seminar-style format and very vigorous discussion between and during presentations. Most presentations ran 30% to 50% longer than planned, and our impression is that most of the participants found it very productive.},

Document length normalization is used to fairly retrieve documents of all lengths. In this study, we ohserve that a normalization scheme that retrieves documents of all lengths with similar chances as their likelihood of relevance will outperform another scheme which retrieves documents with chances very different from their likelihood of relevance. We show that the retrievaf probabilities for a particular normalization method deviate systematically from the relevance probabilities across different collections. We present pivoted normalization, a technique that can be used to modify any normalization function thereby reducing the gap between the relevance and the retrieval probabilities. Training pivoted normalization on one collection, we can successfully use it on other (new) text collections, yielding a robust, collectzorz independent normalization technique. We use the idea of pivoting with the well known cosine normalization function. We point out some shortcomings of the cosine function andpresent two new normalization functions--pivoted unique normalization and piuotert byte size normalization.},

We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.},

abstract = {This paper proposes evaluation methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance judgements in IR experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modem large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In- Query I) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel way of examining the accuracy of the evaluation measures commonly used in information retrieval experiments. It validates several of the rules-of-thumb experimenters use, such as the number of queries needed for a good experiment is at least 25 and 50 is better, while challenging other beliefs, such as the common evaluation measures are equally reliable. As an example, we show that Precision at 30 documents has about twice the average error rate as Average Precision has. These results can help information retrieval researchers design experiments that provide a desired level of confidence in their results. In particular, we suggest researchers using Web measures such as Precision at 10 documents will need to use many more than 50 queries or will have to require two methods to have a very large difference in evaluation scores before concluding that the two methods are actually different.},

abstract = {Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing is a novel approach to automated document indexing which is based on a statistical latent class model for factor analysis of count data. Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain{specific synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and defines a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methods as well as over LSI. In particular, the combination of models with different dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous.},

The workshop focused on discussing the challenges and difficulties of researching and studying collaborative information retrieval and seeking (CIS/CIR). After an introductory and scene setting overview of developments in CIR/CIS, participants were challenged with devising a range of possible CIR/CIS tasks that could be used for evaluation purposes. Through the brainstorming and discussions, valuable insights regarding the evaluation of CIR/CIS tasks become apparent ? for particular tasks efficiency and/or effectiveness is most important, however for the majority of tasks the success and quality of outcomes along with knowledge sharing and sense-making were most important ? of which these latter attributes are much more difficult to measure and evaluate. Thus the major challenge for CIR/CIS research is to develop methods, measures and methodologies to evaluate these high order attributes.},

abstract = {In this report we describe the outcome of the First International Workshop on Professional Search, held in co-location with SIGIR 2018. The workshop addressed the specific requirements and challenges of professional search, as opposed to web search. The workshop included a survey held among 113 professional searchers, two keynote talks, six short paper talks, and two break-out sessions. From all parts of the workshop, we concluded that (1) we can define professional search with a set of common characteristics; but (2) there are definitely differences between domains; (3) we are in need of more knowledge about the search process in different domains, and (4) we need to collect data, not only Cranfieldstyle test collections, but also user observation data that help us understand the challenges and requirements of professional search better. Currently, there are many open problems that potentially have an impact on the IR community beyond the professional domains. We therefore call the scientific IR community to address professional search more actively.},

The second, and major part, considers the broad aspects of information science as a field: origin, problems addressed, areas of study, structure, specialties, paradigm splits, and education problems. The third part discusses the limits of information science in terms of internal limits imposed by the activities in the field and external limits imposed by the very human nature of information processing and use. Throughout, issues related to users and use are transposed, as being of primary concern.},

Previously, RuSSIRs have taken place in Yekaterinburg, Taganrog, Petrozavodsk, Voronezh, Saint Petersburg, Yaroslavl, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Saratov. Over these years, RuSSIR courses have been taught by world-renowned researchers and industry leaders in Information Retrieval and related areas.This year, we had a record number of around 120 participants in total (counting in students, teachers, organizers, and sponsors' representatives); there were 87 students attending RuSSIR 2018. While the majority of participants were from various Russian universities, there were also representatives from the USA, Spain, Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Estonia, China, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Austria, and Finland. School participation was free of charge due to support from the school's sponsors. In addition, 10 international students and two teachers received travel support from the BCS IRSG and ACM SIGIR.},

abstract = {In this paper we overview the 2014 Entity Recognition and Disambiguation Challenge (ERD'14), which took place from March to June 2014 and was summarized in a dedicated workshop at SIGIR 2014. The main goal of the ERD challenge was to promote research in recognition and disambiguation of entities in unstructured text. Unlike many past entity linking challenges, no mention segmentations were given to the participating systems for a given document. Participants were asked to implement a web service for their system to minimize human involvement during evaluation and to enable measuring the processing times. The challenge has attracted a lot of interest (over 100 teams registered, and 27 of those submitted final results).In this paper we cover the task definition, issues encountered during annotation, and provide a detailed analysis of all the participating systems. Specifically, we show how we adapted the pooling technique to address the difficulties of gathering annotations for the entity linking task. We also summarize the ERD workshop that followed the challenge, including the oral and poster presentations as well as the invited talks.},

abstract = {Although we see the positive results of information retrieval research embodied throughout the Internet, on our computer desktops, and in many other aspects of daily life, at the same time we notice that people still have a wide variety of difficulties in finding information that is useful in resolving their problematic situations. This suggests that there still remain substantial challenges for research in IR. Already in 1988, on the occasion of receiving the ACM SIGIR Gerard Salton Award, Karen Sp\"{a}rck Jones suggested that substantial progress in information retrieval was likely only to come through addressing issues associated with users (actual or potential) of IR systems, rather than continuing IR research's almost exclusive focus on document representation and matching and ranking techniques. In recent years it appears that her message has begun to be heard, yet we still have relatively few substantive results that respond to it. In this paper, I identify and discuss a few challenges for IR research which fall within the scope of association with users, and which I believe, if properly addressed, are likely to lead to substantial increases in the usefulness, usability and pleasurability of information retrieval.},

abstract = {SIGIR, from its very onset in the early 1960's, has been concerned with the development of automatic information retrieval systems and with improving the effectiveness of automatic indexing. Automatic indexing is a subsystem, or component, of an automatic information retrieval system. The term "automatic" implies that the process is to be accomplished by a set of computer programs rather than by the intellectual effort of skilled people. The essential questions that need to be answered are how automatic indexing can:• Adequately represent the subject content of a document;• Improve recall by increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved;• Improve precision by decreasing the number of non-relevant documents retrieved.In this tutorial, I will review the basic and improved procedures that have been devised to respond to each of these questions. Finally, after we have reviewed developments in automatic indexing, we will consider the more radical questions of:• Whether we can rely exclusively on automatic indexing to achieve adequate retrieval effectiveness in online interactive document retrieval systems, and• Whether the traditional recall and precision ratios are the best criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of online retrieval systems.},

abstract = {The second workshop on Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech (SSCS 2008) was held in Singapore on July 24, 2008 in conjunction with the 31st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference. The goal of the workshop was to bring the speech community and the information retrieval community together. The forum was designed to be conducive to the close interaction and the intense discussion necessary to promote fusion of these fields into a single discipline with a concerted vision of spoken content retrieval. At the workshop, talks and posters were presented covering a wide range of topics including vocabulary independent search, spoken term detection, combination of models/indexes, use of speech recognition lattices for search, segmentation, temporal analysis, benchmarking, exploitation of prosody, speech surrogates for user interfaces and multi-language collections. Demonstrations of speech-based retrieval systems from a variety of application domains introduced a strong practical emphasis into the workshop program. The workshop concluded with a panel discussion, whose goal it was to identify future research directions for speech retrieval. Among the important challenges identified during the panel discussions were: dealing with large scale multimedia collections, representing audio/video content effectively in the user interface, focusing on perfecting the component technologies on which speech retrieval systems are based, and developing systems and approaches that will enable users (both content seekers and content providers) to actively create their own speech search applications or contribute to the indexability of their content.},

abstract = {Information retrieval is the process of finding relevant information in large corpora of documents based on user queries. Within the discipline there are a number of open research questions and areas. This thesis presents a systematic study into improving the speed of all aspects of an information retrieval system, without such improvements having an adverse effect on the effectiveness of that system.Several key areas of the indexing process were investigated: the effect of removing spam and correcting encoding errors at indexing time; the amount of parallelism and further improvements to the indexing process; the methods of vocabulary accumulation and collision resolution within a hash table; and as part of the indexing process, a new family of hash functions for information retrieval which exploit the properties of natural language was proposed.Search performance was also investigated by examining the effects of the spam removal on search quality. A relationship between the size of a collection and the pre-calculation of retrieval scores was discovered.Overall results indicate a 30% improvement of indexing throughput. This is accompanied by a 15% increase in search quality, whilst its speed could be increased by 25% without degrading quality. The pre-calculation of retrieval scores further improves retrieval speed by up to 3--.These results were compared against other open-source indexing systems by ATIRE when participating in the SIGIR 2015 RIGOR Workshop Reproducibility Challenge. The results of this challenge show that ATIRE is the fastest indexing system (taking half the time of the next best system), and the second fastest search system using the discovered relationship.},

abstract = {After two successful years at SIGIR in 2007 and 2008, the third workshop on Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech (SSCS 2009) was held conjunction with the ACM Multimedia 2009. The goal of the SSCS series is to serve as a forum that brings together the disciplines that collaborate on spoken content retrieval, including information retrieval, speech recognition and multimedia analysis. Multimedia collections often contain a speech track, but in many cases it is ignored or not fully exploited for information retrieval. Currently, spoken content retrieval research is expanding beyond highly-conventionalized domains such as broadcast news in to domains involving speech that is produced spontaneously and in conversational settings. Such speech is characterized by wide variability of speaking styles, subject matter and recording conditions. The work presented at SSCS 2009 included techniques for searching meetings, interviews, telephone conversations, podcasts and spoken annotations. The work encompassed a large range of approaches including using subword units, exploiting dialogue structure, fusing retrieval models, modeling topics and integrating visual features. Taken in sum, the workshop demonstrated the high potential of new ideas emerging in the area of speech search and also reinforced the need for concentrated research devoted to the classic challenges of spoken content retrieval, many of which remain yet unsolved.},

abstract = {The need for a network of heterogeneous interactive bibliographic information retrieval systems is projected from the facts of wide acceptance and growing demand for these systems and the limitations of their use caused by limited online data base size. Because of the established characters of the different I-R systems and unlikelihood that a standardized I-R system leading directly to the ultimate uniform network will soon be generally adopted, we propose an intermediate solution in which computer interfaces would provide the networking capability by translating and converting among the diverse languages and data bases of existing systems.We have begun work on such a network in which the computer interface is based on the concept of a common language for commands, indexing vocabularies, and data base structures. In particular, the common language for commands and data base structures is based on identifying the basic or primitive I-R functions and bibliographic data base elements. The conversion among indexing vocabularies is based on the concept of a Master Index and Thesaurus containing the conglomerate thesaurus information from the separate data bases. In addition, the phrase decomposition and stemming of the individual words in the search request and subject index phrases are used as further techniques for automated conversion among diverse vocabularies. An initial experimental interface is described which interconnects the M.I.T.

abstract = {Due to the dramatically increasing amount of available data, effective and scalable solutions for data organization and search are essential. Distributed solutions naturally provide promising alternatives to standard centralized approaches. With the computational power of thousands or millions of computers in clusters or peer-to-peer systems, the challenges that arise are manifold, ranging from efficient resource discovery to issues in load balancing and distributed query processing.The 2009 edition of the Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR'09) provided a forum for researchers to discuss these problems and to define new directions in research on Distributed Information Retrieval. The Workshop program featured research contributions in the areas of collection selection, similarity search, index compression, distributed indexing, query processing, distributed computing, and network formation. In addition, there were two industry talks on large scale Web search and distributed computing.},

abstract = {Most information retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate information discovery. However, much knowledge work involves finding and re-using previously seen information. We describe the design and evaluation of a system, called Stuff I've Seen (SIS), that facilitates information re-use. This is accomplished in two ways. First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation.},

abstract = {Classic IR (information retrieval) is inherently predicated on users searching for information, the so-called "information need". But the need behind a web search is often not informational -- it might be navigational (give me the url of the site I want to reach) or transactional (show me sites where I can perform a certain transaction, e.g. shop, download a file, or find a map). We explore this taxonomy of web searches and discuss how global search engines evolved to deal with web-specific needs.},

abstract = {There is broad consensus in the field of IR that search is complex in many use cases and applications, both on the Web and in domain-specific collections, and both in our professional and in our daily life. Yet our understanding of complex search tasks, in comparison to simple look up tasks, is fragmented at best. The workshop addressed many open research questions: What are the obvious use cases and applications of complex search? What are essential features of work tasks and search tasks to take into account? And how do these evolve over time? With a multitude of information, varying from introductory to specialized, and from authoritative to speculative or opinionated, when should which sources of information be shown? How does the information seeking process evolve and what are relevant differences between different stages? With complex task and search process management, blending searching, browsing, and recommendations, and supporting exploratory search to sensemaking and analytics, UI and UX design pose an overconstrained challenge. How do we know that our approach is any good? Supporting complex search tasks requires new collaborations across the whole field of IR, and the proposed workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers to work together on one of the greatest challenges of our field. The workshop featured three main elements. First, two keynotes, one on the complexity of meaningful interactive IR evaluation by Mark Hall and one on the types of search complexity encountered in real-world applications by Jussi Karlgren. Second, a lively boaster and poster session in which seven contributed papers were presented. Third, three breakout groups discussed concrete ideas on: (1) search context and tasks, (2) search process, and (3) evaluation of complex search tasks. There was an general feeling that the discussion made progress, and built new connections between related strands of research in IR},

abstract = {The overall motivation for the Interactive Track (iTrack) at INEX is twofold. First, to investigate the behaviour of users when interacting with components of XML documents, and secondly to investigate and develop approaches for XML retrieval which are effective in user-based environments. One of the major outcomes of the track in 2004 was the need to investigate methods that can be supportive during the search process based on features extracted from the XML formatting[1][2]. Problems that might be solved using such methods include overlapping components and the presentation of retrieved elements in the result list. In the experimental system that was offered in 2005, these two issues were addressed. This offered the opportunity to study how overall user search behaviour was affected by these changes when compared to the behaviour observed in 2004. In addition, the following issues were addressed in 2005, following the recommendations of the INEX Methodology Workshop at the Glasgow IR Festival1.},

abstract = {The news industry has undergone a revolution in the past decade, with substantial changes continuing to this day. News consumption habits are changing due to the increase in the volume of news and the variety of sources. Readers need new mechanisms to cope with this vast volume of information in order to not only find a signal in the noise, but also to understand what is happening in the world given the multiple points of view describing events. These challenges in journalism relate to Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields such as: verification of a source's reliability; the integration of news with other sources of information; real-time processing of both news content and social streams; de-duplication of stories; and entity detection and disambiguation. Although IR and NLP have been applied to news for decades, the changing nature of the space requires fresh approaches and a closer collaboration with our colleagues from the journalism environment. Following the success of the previous version of the workshop (NewsIR'16), the goal of this workshop, held in conjunction with ECIR 2018, is to continue to stimulate such discussion between the communities and to share interesting approaches to solve real user problems. A total number of 19 submissions were received and reviewed, of which 12 were accepted for presentation. In addition to that, we had over 30 registered participants in the workshop who were pleased to attend the two keynote talks given by well-known experts in the field - Edgar Meij (from industry) and Peter Tolmie (from academia) and oral and poster presentations from the accepted papers. The workshop also included a breakout session to discuss ideas for a future data challenge in news IR and closed with a focused panel discussion to reflect on the day. In summary, several ideas were presented in the workshop on solving complex information needs in the news domain. In addition, the workshop concluded with suggestions of important challenges and shared tasks to work on as a community for News IR.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of structure on the web as a result of modern web languages, user tagging and annotation, emerging robust NLP tools, and an ever growing volume of linked data. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use.ESAIR'13 focuses on two of the most challenging aspects to address in the coming years. First, there is a need to include the currently emerging knowledge resources (such as DBpedia, Freebase) as underlying semantic model giving access to an unprecedented scope and detail of factual information. Second, there is a need to include annotations beyond the topical dimension (think of sentiment, reading level, prerequisite level, etc) that contain vital cues for matching the specific needs and profile of the searcher at hand.There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, the discussion contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, emerging large scale knowledge bases form a crucial component for semantic search, providing a unified framework with zillions of entities and relations. Second, in addition to low level factual annotation, non-topical annotation of larger chunks of text can provide powerful cues on the expertise of the search and (un)suitability of information. Third, novel user interfaces are key to unleash powerful structured querying enabled by semantic annotation|the potential of rich document annotations can only be realized if matched by more articulate queries exploiting these powerful retrieval cues|and a more dynamic approach is emerging by exploiting new forms of query autosuggest.},

However, many grand challenges remain. Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the research in domain specific IR applications, as evidenced by the organization of Genomics and Legal tracks in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). Now it is the right time to carry out large scale evaluations on chemical datasets in order to promote the research in chemical IR in general and chemical Patent IR in particular. Accordingly, we organize a chemical IR track in TREC (TREC-CHEM) in order to address the challenges in chemical and patent IR.

In this essay, I argue that these definitions are inaccurate, fail to capture major threads of activity in IR research, and in particular are flawed because they omit the element of human participation in the retrieval process. After outlining some perspectives to consider in formulating better definitions, I offer an option, as an illustration of how the field might be presented; this option is centred on the purpose of IR, namely, support of cognition. There is an obvious need for a clear statement of the purpose of the discipline: information access is recognized as a human right and IR is the basis of a critical technology for providing that access -- one that is deeply intertwined with daily life and is changing human psychology. Well-grounded descriptions can encourage IR researchers to embrace a view of the field that enables richer connection with other disciplines, and should embody a vision of what IR research can accomplish.},

Second, an oral presentation session in which four papers were presented. Third, a discussion based on three seed research questions: (1) In what ways is collaborative search evaluation more challenging than individual interactive information retrieval (IIIR) evaluation? (2) Would it be possible and/or useful to standardise experimental designs and data for collaborative search evaluation? and (3) For evaluating collaborative search, can we leverage ideas from other tasks such as diversified search, subtopic mining and/or e-discovery? The discussion was intense and raised many points and issues, leading to the proposition that a new evaluation track focused on collaborative information retrieval/seeking tasks, would be worthwhile.},

abstract = {The practical goal of information retrieval (IR) research is to create ways to support humans to better access information in order to better carry out their tasks. Because of this, IR research has a primarily technological interest in knowledge creation -- how to interact with information (better)? IR research therefore has a constructive aspect (to create novel systems) and an evaluative aspect (are they any good?). Evaluation of IR effectiveness is guided by a theory on factors that affect effectiveness. True science is about theory development, i.e., understanding and explaining, making hypotheses and testing them. Theories express structured explanatory relationships between variables such as "type of document indexing" and "quality of ranking measured by MAP". Theories are the better, the wider range of phenomena they are able cover accurately. The paper argues that most existing theories of IR are focused on a narrow scope, theories of ranking. To fulfill its task of supporting human information access, theories that go beyond the evaluation of ranking are highly desired but face many challenges. We discuss three additional types of IR theories: theories of searching, theories of information access, and theories of information interaction.},

abstract = {We present a non-traditional retrieval problem we call subtopic retrieval. The subtopic retrieval problem is concerned with finding documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic. In such a problem, the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking, violating the assumption of independent relevance which is assumed in most traditional retrieval methods. Subtopic retrieval poses challenges for evaluating performance, as well as for developing effective algorithms. We propose a framework for evaluating subtopic retrieval which generalizes the traditional precision and recall metrics by accounting for intrinsic topic difficulty as well as redundancy in documents. We propose and systematically evaluate several methods for performing subtopic retrieval using statistical language models and a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) ranking strategy. A mixture model combined with query likelihood relevance ranking is shown to modestly outperform a baseline relevance ranking on a data set used in the TREC interactive track.},

The event was composed of a mix and blend of academics, experts and students wanting to learn, share and create evaluation resources for the community. The hacking was intense and the discussions lively creating the basis of many useful tools but also raising numerous issues. It was clear that by adopting and contributing to most widely used and supported Open Source IR toolkit, there were many benefits for academics, students, researchers, developers and practitioners - providing a basis for stronger evaluation practices, increased reproducibility, more efficient knowledge transfer, greater collaboration between academia and industry, and shared teaching and training resources.},

In particular, it is suggested that different test statistics should be used for providing additional information about the experiments other that the one provided by statistical significance testing. Kendall's τ is often used for testing-rank correlation, yet it is little appropriate if the objective of the test is different from what τ was designed for. In particular, attention should be paid to the null hypothesis. Other measures for rank correlation are described. If one test statistic suggests to reject a hypothesis, other test statistics should be used to support or to revise the decision. The paper then focuses on rank correlation between webpage lists ordered by PageRank for applying the general reflections on these test statistics. An interpretation of PageRank behaviour is provided on the basis of the discussion of the test statistics for rank correlation.},

This article includes a description of the motivations and goals of the workshop and syntheses of major workshop activities including pre- workshop identification of challenges by each participant and discussion breakout groups. Major themes of the workshop included the development of domain-neutral modeling techniques to represent tasks, task properties and task-related search behaviors, interface support tools to assist with a variety of task-related information behaviors and the identification of techniques and tools to evaluate task-based search systems. The most critical need identified was the development of task models; this was viewed as essential for addressing the challenges of tools and evaluation measures.},

When an experiment is repeated by a different researcher and exactly the same result is obtained, we can say the experiment has been replicated. When the results are not exactly the same but the conclusions are compatible with the prior ones, we have a reproduction of the experiment. Reproducibility and replication involve recommendation algorithm implementations, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics. While the problem of reproducibility and replication has been recognized in the Recommender Systems community, the need for a clear solution remains largely unmet, which motivates the main questions addressed in the present workshop.},

In this essay, we review those questions and explore several further issues that affect the usefulness of recall. In particular, we ask whether it is reasonable to expect to be able to measure recall; whether some researchers are conflating the concepts of recall and answer set cardinality; and whether it is plausible that a user would rely on a belief that a system is "high recall" to deeply explore an answer list. Combined with earlier observations about the unknowability of recall, and the lack of a plausible user model in which recall is a measure of satisfaction, we conclude that use of recall as a measure of the effectiveness of ranked querying is indefensible.},

However, effective personalized search requires collecting and aggregating user information, which often raise serious concerns of privacy infringement for many users. Indeed, these concerns have become one of the main barriers for deploying personalized search applications, and how to do privacy-preserving personalization is a great challenge. In this paper, we systematically examine the issue of privacy preservation in personalized search. We distinguish and define four levels of privacy protection, and analyze various software architectures for personalized search. We show that client-side personalization has advantages over the existing server-side personalized search services in preserving privacy, and envision possible future strategies to fully protect user privacy.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of structure on the Web as a result of modern Web languages, user tagging and annotation, and emerging robust NLP tools. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. The workshop had an interactive format consisting of keynotes, boasters and posters, breakout groups and reports, and a final discussion, which was prolonged into the evening. There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, each of the breakout groups contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, annotations and use cases come in many different shapes and forms depending on the domain at hand, but at a higher level there are commonalities in annotation tools, indexing methods, user interfaces, and general methodology. Second, there is a framework emerging to view annotation as (1) a linking procedure, connecting (2) an analysis of information objects with (3) a semantic model of some sort, expressing relations that contribute to (4) a task of interest to end users. Third, we should look at complex tasks that cannot be comprehensible articulated in a few keywords, and embrace interaction both to incrementally refine the search request and to explore the results at various stages, guided by the semantic structure.},

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large scale human-curated knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques that identify or extract information automatically from unstructured and semi-structured sources. The ESAIR workshop series aims to advance the general research agenda on the problem of creating and exploiting semantic annotations. The eighth edition of ESAIR took place at CIKM 2015 in Melbourne, Australia, on the 23rd of October. Having a special focus on applications, we dedicated an "annotations in action" track to demonstrations that showcase innovative prototype systems, in addition to the regular research and position paper contributions. The workshop also featured invited talks from leaders in the field. This report presents an overview of the event and its major outcomes.},

They do not take full account of inflectional semantics nor, for example, diacritics or the use of capitals. Our main aim was to discuss the additional problems faced in non-English Web queries and to suggest techniques to improve the response of searching systems. Papers related to Arabic, Basque, Farsi (Persian), Greek, Spanish, Swedish, Hindi, Bengali and other south asian languages were accepted. Conclusions were that search engines would be more effective if they took more account of the properties of individual languages, and that there is a need for more studies of real user behaviour in practical situations.},

The goal of the ESAIR'14 workshop remained to advance the general research agenda on this core problem, with an explicit focus on one of the most challenging aspects to address in the coming years. The main remaining challenge is on the user's side---the potential of rich document annotations can only be realized if matched by more articulate queries exploiting these powerful retrieval cues---and a more dynamic approach is emerging by exploiting new forms of query autosuggest. How can the query suggestion paradigm be used to encourage searcher to articulate longer queries, with concepts and relations linking their statement of request to existing semantic models? How do entity results and social network data in "graph search" change the classic division between searchers and information and lead to extreme personalization---are you the query? How to leverage transaction logs and recommendation, and how adaptive should we make the system? What are the privacy ramifications and the UX aspects---how to not creep out users.There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, the discussion contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, for notable (head, shoulder, but not tail) entities in semantic search we have reached the level of quality at minimal costs allowing for deployment in major web search engines---the dream has become a reality. Second, entity detection is moving fast into domain specific, personal, and business domains, and has become a vital component for a range of applications. Third, semantic web has exchanged logic for machine learning approaches, and machine learning is the natural unification of semantic web and information retrieval approaches.},

What are essential features of work tasks and search tasks to take into account? And how do these evolve over time? With a multitude of information, varying from introductory to specialized, and from authoritative to speculative or opinionated, when to show what sources of information? How does the information seeking process evolve and what are relevant differences between different stages? With complex task and search process management, blending searching, browsing, and recommendations, and supporting exploratory search to sensemaking and analytics, UI and UX design pose an overconstrained challenge. How do we know that our approach is any good? Supporting complex search tasks requires new collaborations across the whole field of IR, and the proposed workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers to work together on one of the greatest challenges of our field.The workshop featured three main elements. First, a keynote on an emerging theory of task difficulty by Diane Kelly. Second, a lively boaster and poster session in which seven contributed papers were presented. Third, three breakout groups on: 1) user interfaces and user experience, 2) tasks and users, and 3) information needs on controversial topics. There was an general feeling that the discussion made progress, and built new connections between related strands of research in IR.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of structure on the web as a result of modern web languages, user tagging and annotation, emerging robust NLP tools, and an ever growing volume of linked data. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. To complicate matters, standard text search excels at shallow information needs expressed by short keyword queries, and here semantic annotation contributes very little, if anything. The main questions for the workshop are how to leverage the rich context currently available, especially in a mobile search scenario, giving powerful new handles to exploit semantic annotations. And how can we fruitfully combine information retrieval and knowledge intensive approaches, and for the first time work actively toward a unified view on exploiting semantic annotations.There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, each of the breakout groups contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, there is a need for further integration of symbolic and statistical methods with each adopting parts of the other's strengths, by focusing on types of annotations that are informed by and meaningful for the task at hand, and relying on automatic information extraction and annotation based on web scale observations. Second, the discussion contributed to the creation of a concrete shared corpus with state of the art semantic annotation--in particular a web crawl annotated with Freebase concepts--that will benefit research in this area for years to come.},

abstract = {One of the primary ways researchers have characterized engagement is by an increase in search actions. Another possibility is that instead of experiencing increased engagement, people who click and query frequently are actually frustrated; several studies have shown that frustration is also characterized by increases in clicking and querying behaviors. This research seeks to illuminate the differences in search behavior between participants who are engaged and frustrated, as well as investigate the effect of task interest on engagement and frustration. To accomplish this, a laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Participants completed four tasks, and responded to questionnaires that measured their engagement, frustration, and stress. Participants were asked to rank eight topics based on interest, and were given their two most interesting and two least interesting tasks. Poor search result quality was introduced to induce frustration during their most interesting and least interesting tasks.This study found that physiological signals hold some promise for disambiguating engagement and frustration, but this depends on the time frame and manner in which they are examined. Frustrated participants had significantly more skin conductance responses during the task, while engaged participants had greater increases in skin conductance during the first 60 seconds of the task. Significant main and interaction effects for interest and frustration were found for heart rate in the window analysis, indicating that heart rate fluctuations over time can be most effective in distinguishing engagement from frustration. The multilevel modeling of engagement and frustration confirmed this, showing that interest contributed significantly to the model of skin conductance, while frustration contributed significantly to the model of heart rate.This study also found that interest had a significant effect on engagement, while the frustrator effectively created frustration. Frustration also had a significant effect on selfreported stress. Participants exhibited increases in search actions such as clicks and scrolls during periods of both engagement and frustration, but a regression analyses showed that scrolls, clicks on documents, and SERP clicks were most predictive of a frustrating episode. A significant main effect for interest was found for time between queries, indicating that this could be a useful signal of engagement. A model including the physiological signals and search behaviors showed that physiological signals aided in the prediction of engagement and frustration.Findings of this research have provided insight into the utility of physiological signals in distinguishing emotional states as well as provided evidence about the relationship among search actions, engagement and frustration. These findings have also increased our understanding of the role emotions play in search behavior and how information about a searcher's emotional state can be used to improve the search experience.},

abstract = {In information retrieval, federated search is the problem of automatically searching across multiple distributed collections or resources. It is typically decomposed into two subsequent steps: deciding which resources to search (resource selection) and deciding how to combine results from multiple resources into a single presentation (results merging). Federated search occurs in different environments. This dissertation focuses on an environment that has not been deeply investigated in prior work.The growing heterogeneity of digital media and the broad range of user information needs that occur in today's world have given rise to a multitude of systems that specialize on a specific type of search task. Examples include search for news, images, video, local businesses, items for sale, and even social-media interactions. In the Web search domain, these specialized systems are called verticals and one important task for the Web search engine is the prediction and integration of relevant vertical content into the Web search results. This is known as aggregated web search and is the main focus on this dissertation.Providing a single-point of access to all these diverse systems requires federated search solutions that can support result-type and retrieval-algorithm heterogeneity. This type of heterogeneity violates major assumptions made by state-of-the-art resource selection and results merging methods and motivates the development of new techniques.While existing resource selection methods derive evidence exclusively from sampled resource content, the approaches proposed in this dissertation draw on machine learning as a means to easily integrate various different types of evidence. These include, for example, evidence derived from (sampled) vertical content, vertical query-traffic, click-through information, and properties of the query string. In order to operate in a heterogeneous environment, we focus on methods that can learn a vertical-specific relationship between features and relevance. We also present methods that reduce the need for human-produced training data. In particular, we focus on the situation where we have vertical-relevance judgments for some verticals and want to learn a predictive model for a vertical associated with no training data.Existing results merging methods formulate the task as score normalization. In a more heterogeneous environment, however, combining results into a single presentation requires satisfying a number of layout constraints. The dissertation proposes a novel formulation of the task: block ranking. During block-ranking, the objective is to rank sequences of results that must appear grouped together (vertically or horizontally) in the final presentation. Based on this formulation, the dissertation proposes and empirically validates a cost-effective methodology for evaluating aggregated web search results. Finally, it proposes the use of machine learning methods for the task of block-ranking.This dissertation was completed at School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University under the advise of Dr. Jamie Callan (dissertation committee chair). Dr. Jaime Carbonell, Dr. Yiming Yang, and Dr. Fernando Diaz served as dissertation committee members. For the full dissertation, visit: http://ils.unc.edu/~jarguell.},

abstract = {Verifiability is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, where editors are encouraged to provide citations for the added statements. Statements can be any arbitrary piece of text, ranging from a sentence up to a paragraph. However, in many cases, citations are either outdated, missing, or link to non-existing references (e.g. dead URL, moved content etc.). In total, 20% of the cases such citations refer to news articles and represent the second most cited source. Even in cases where citations are provided, there are no explicit indicators for the span of a citation for a given piece of text. In addition to issues related with the verifiability principle, many Wikipedia entity pages are incomplete, with relevant information that is already available in online news sources missing. Even for the already existing citations, there is often a delay between the news publication time and the reference time. In this thesis, we address the aforementioned issues and propose automated approaches that enforce the verifiability principle in Wikipedia, and suggest relevant and missing news references for further enriching Wikipedia entity pages. To this end we make the following contributions as part of this thesis [1, 2, 3, 4]},

This is not an idle question; characteristics of the web, such as power law relationships, diameter, and connected components have all been observed within the scope of general web crawls, constructed by blindly following links. The .GOV collection is a fairly straightforward 18GB crawl of sites in the .gov domain. In contrast, WT10g was carved out from a much larger crawl specifically to be a web search test collection within the reach of university researchers. Do such collections retain the properties of the larger web? In the case of WT10g and .GOV, yes.},

Inter-disciplinary research across these tracks encourages advances in the development of databases, the extraction of information and the discovery of knowledge. This is precisely the focus of our article. We explain the research issues addressed in a Ph.D. workshop recently held at the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. This workshop had presentations on novel ideas addressing challenges in information and knowledge management. It covered a broad range of topics such as XML architectures, sensor data streams, personal information managers and text pre-processing. In this article, we provide an overview of the research problems and solutions discussed in the Ph.D. workshop. Our article thus describes the latest technological developments in information and knowledge management as seen by academia. This cutting edge technology also finds practical applications in the corporate world.},

abstract = {Document understanding for the purpose of assessing the relevance of a document or passage to a query based only on the document content appears to be a familiar goal for information retrieval community, however, this problem has remained largely intractable, despite repeated attacks over many years. This is while people are able to assess the relevance quite well, though unfamiliar topics and complex documents can defeat them. This assessment may require the ability to understand language, images, document structure, videos, audio, and functional elements. In turn, understanding of these elements is built on background information about the world, such as human behavior patterns, and even more fundamental truths such as the existence of time, space, and people. All this comes naturally to people, but not to computers.Recently, large-scale machine learning has altered the landscape. Deep learning has greatly advanced machine understanding of images and language. Since document and query understanding incorporate these elements, deep learning can hold great promise. But it comes with a drawback: general purpose representations (like CNNs for images) have proved somewhat elusive for text. In particular, embeddings act as a distributed representation not just of semantic information but also application-specific learning, which are hard to transfer. In short, conditions seem right for a renewed attempt on the fundamental document understanding problem.},

abstract = {Past decade witnessed an explosive growth in the amount of unstructured data, especially in the public domain, mainly due to Web 2.0 and social media. This led to the creation of applications, called information extractors, that extract structured information from unstruc- tured data. The extracted information is stored in a Knowledge Base (KB). KB stores facts about entities like name, type and other attributes. My PhD thesis entitled 'Named Entity Extraction for Knowledgebase Enhancement' deals with information extraction on named entities with the purpose of enhancing a KB. The enhanced KB is in turn used by the information extraction task to refine the extraction process. Thus, KB provides structure and guidance to the extraction task, and gets enhanced by the results of the extraction task. Here we see that the tasks of entity extraction and KB enhancement are mutually dependent and mutually beneficial. Hence in my research I propose methods to enhance both the tasks, in an effort to build a strong and sound named entity extraction system. Named Entity Extraction, also known as Entity Linking (EL) in scientific literature, is the task of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text. EL helps automatic extraction of structured information about entities from unstructured data, which is stored in the KB. EL consists of Mention Detection and Entity Disambiguation. In my research, I propose methods to enhance mention detection, entity disambiguation and KB enhancement.},

abstract = {Research in Information Retrieval has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query. Real users, however, often begin an interaction with a search engine with a sufficiently under-specified information need that they will need to reformulate before they find either the one thing or every thing they are looking for. We define a session as the sequence of queries and interactions that a user performs in service of an information need. The first workshop on Information Retrieval Over Query Sessions was held at ECIR 2011 in Dublin, Ireland, with the purpose of investigating questions of measuring, analyzing, and optimizing IR system behavior over a session of reformulations.},

abstract = {Due to the dramatically increasing amount of available data, effective and scalable solutions for data organization and search are essential. Distributed solutions naturally provide promising alternatives to standard centralized approaches. With the computational power of thousands or millions of computers in clusters or peer-to-peer systems, the challenges that arise are manifold, ranging from efficient resource discovery to issues in load balancing and distributed query processing.The 2008 edition of the Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR'08) provided a forum for researchers to discuss these problems and to define new directions for the work on Distributed Information Retrieval. The Workshop program featured research contributions in the areas of similarity search, resource selection, network organization schemes, issues of data quality, result ranking techniques and query routing algorithms.},

The seminar title was interpreted in an IR-style "andish" sense (it covered also subsets of {Ranking, XML, Querying}, with larger sets being favored) rather than the DB-style strictly conjunctive manner. So in essence, the seminar really addressed the integration of DB and IR technologies with Web 2.0 being an important target area.},

abstract = {The news industry has gone through seismic shifts in the past decade with digital content and social media completely redefining how people consume news. Readers check for accurate fresh news from multiple sources throughout the day using dedicated apps or social media on their smartphones and tablets. At the same time, news publishers rely more and more on social networks and citizen journalism as a frontline to breaking news. In this new era of fastflowing instant news delivery and consumption, publishers and aggregators have to overcomea great number of challenges. These include the verification or assessment of a source's reliability; the integration of news with other sources of information; real-time processing of both news content and social streams in multiple languages, in different formats and in high volumes; deduplication; entity detection and disambiguation; automatic summarization; and news recommendation. Although Information Retrieval (IR) applied to news has been a popular research area for decades, fresh approaches are needed due to the changing type and volume of media content available and the way people consume this content. Hence, the first international workshop on recent trends in News Information Retrieval (NewsIR) was held in conjunction with ECIR 2016. As part of the workshop, we released a new dataset consisting of one million news articles to the research community. The workshop was very well attended with around 70 registered participants. We received a healthy number of 19 submissions in total of which 12 were accepted for presentation. In addition to that, we were pleased to have two keynote talks by well-known experts in the field - on with an industry background (Jochen Leidner) and one from academia (Julio Gonzalo). The workshop also included a breakout session to discuss ideas for a future data challenge in news IR and closed with a focused panel discussion to reflect on the day. Throughout the day the workshop stimulated discussions around new and powerful uses of IR applied to news sources and the intersection of multiple IR tasks to solve real user problems. In particular, several ideas were presented on solving complex information needs for media monitoring, event detection and summarisation. Moreover, and going forward, the workshop concluded with a long list of suggestions for shared tasks, and dataset requirements.},

For reaching this goal, we need a well-balanced interplay between theory building, hypothesis generation and testing via experimentation.},

New advances in biotechnologies have changed the face of biological research, particularly "high-throughput" techniques such as gene microarrays (Mobasheri, Airley et al., 2004). These not only generate massive amounts of data but also have led to an explosion of new scientific knowledge. As a result, this domain is ripe for improved information access and management.},

abstract = {Since the middle of last century, information retrieval has gained an increasing interest. Since its inception, much research has been devoted to finding optimal ways of representingboth documents and queries, as well as improving ways of matching one with the other. In cases where document annotations or explicit semantics are available, matching algorithms can be informed using the concept languages in which such semantics are usually defined. These algorithms are able to match queries and documents based on textual and semantic evidence.Recent advances have enabled the use of rich query representations in the form of query language models. This, in turn, allows us to account for the language associated with concepts within the retrieval model, in a principled and transparent manner. Developments in the semantic web community, such as the Linked Open Data cloud, have enabled the association of texts with concepts on a large scale. Taken together, these developments facilitate a move beyond manually assigned concepts in domain-specific contexts into the general domain.This thesis investigates how one can improve information access by employing the actual use of concepts as measured by the language that people use when they discuss them. The main contribution is a set of models and methods that enable users to retrieve and access information on a conceptual level. Through extensive evaluations, a systematic exploration and thorough analysis of the experimental results of the proposed models is performed. Our empirical results show that a combination of top-down conceptual information and bottom-up statistical information obtains optimal performance on a variety of tasks and test collections.The dissertation is available online at http://phdthes.is/.},

For some domains, such as movies, the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already, but for many other domains, such as books, news, scientific articles, andWeb pages we still do not know if and how these data sources should be combined to provided the best recommendation performance.

abstract = {With XML information retrieval, like in traditional IR, the user's information need is loosely defined, linguistic variations are frequent, and answers are a ranked list of relevant elements. Like in database querying, structure is of importance and a simple list of keywords may not be sufficient to define an XML query. Structured query languages for XML have been developed, but appear to be difficult to use even by system-level users, let alone end-users. Therefore developing natural language interfaces for XML-IR requires innovative solutions.INEX provides a framework (documents, topics and relevance assessments) for independent evaluation of XML-IR systems and approaches. In 2002 and 2003 systems in the Ad-hoc task accepted formal language queries (i.e. <title> elements) and produced results lists of relevant XML elements (usually well below the document root). In 2004 INEX introduced a Natural Language Processing task that operated in parallel with the Ad-hoc task (using the same topics and assessments) except that systems operated on XML natural language queries (i.e. &lt;description&gt; elements).In this report we describe the motivation for using NLP in XML IR, the general approaches that were tested at INEX 2005, and comment on the results.},

abstract = {Modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines, recommender systems, and conversational agents, are best thought of as interactive systems. And their development is best thought of as a two-stage development process: offline development followed by continued online adaptation and development based on interactions with users. In this opinion paper, we take a closer look at existing IR textbooks and teaching materials, and examine to which degree they cover the offline and online stages of the IR system development process. We notice that current teaching materials in IR focus mostly on search and on the offline development phase. Other scenarios of interacting with information are largely absent from current IR teaching materials, as is the (interactive) online development phase. We identify a list of scenarios and a list of topics that we believe are essential to any modern set of IR teaching materials that claims to fully cover IR system development. In particular, we argue for more attention, in basic IR teaching materials, to scenarios such as recommender systems, and to topics such as query and interaction mining and understanding, online evaluation, and online learning to rank.},

Interaction forms were the primary vehicle for defining and capturing user-system interactions. In total, six groups participated in the ciQA task and contributed ten different sets of interaction forms. There were two main findings: baseline IR techniques are competitive for complex QA and interaction, at least as defined and implemented in this evaluation, did not appear to improve performance by much.},

abstract = {In this thesis we study thoroughly sentence retrieval and novelty detection. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of current state of the art methods and, subsequently, new mechanisms to address sentence retrieval and novelty detection are proposed.Retrieval and novelty detection are related tasks: usually, we initially apply a retrieval model that estimates properly the relevance of passages (e.g. sentences) and generates a ranking of passages sorted by their relevance. Next, this ranking is used as the input of a novelty detection module, which tries to filter out redundant passages in the ranking.The estimation of relevance at sentence level is difficult. Standard methods used to estimate relevance are simply based on matching query and sentence terms. However, queries usually contain two or three terms and sentences are also short. Therefore, the matching between query and sentences is poor. In order to address this problem, we study in this thesis how to enrich this process with additional information: the context. The context refers to the information provided by the surrounding sentences or the document where the sentence is located. Such context reduces ambiguity and supplies additional information not included in the sentence itself. Additionally, it is important to estimate how important or central a sentence is within the document. These two components, the context and the centrality of the sentences, are studied in this thesis following a formal framework based on Statistical Language Models. In this respect, we demonstrate that these components yield to improvements in current sentence retrieval methods.In this thesis we work with collections of sentences that were extracted from news. News not only explain facts but also express opinions that people have about a particular event or topic. Therefore, the proper estimation of which passages are opinionated may help to further improve the estimation of relevance for sentences. We apply a formal methodology that helps us to incorporate opinions into standard sentence retrieval methods. Additionally, we propose simple empirical alternatives to incorporate query-independent features into sentence retrieval models. We demonstrate that the incorporation of opinions to estimate relevance is an important factor that makes sentence retrieval methods more effective. In the course of our study, we also analyze query-independent features based on sentence length and named entities.The combination of the context-based approach with the incorporation of opinion-based features is straightforward. We study how to combine these two approaches and the impact of such combination. We demonstrate that context-based models are implicitly promoting sentences with opinions and, therefore, opinion-based features do not help to further improve context-based methods.The second part of this thesis is dedicated to novelty detection at sentence level. Because novelty is actually dependent on a retrieval ranking, we consider here two approaches: a) the perfect-relevance approach, which consists of using a ranking where all sentences are relevant (this is an ideal approach); and b) the non-perfect relevance approach, which consists of applying first a sentence retrieval method (therefore, the ranking may contain sentences that are not relevant).We first study which baseline performs the best and, next, we propose a number of variations. One of the mechanisms proposed is based on vocabulary pruning. We demonstrate that considering terms from the top ranked sentences in the original ranking helps to guide the estimation of novelty. The application of Language Models to support novelty detection is another challenge that we face in this thesis. We apply different smoothing methods (Dirichlet and Jelinek-Mercer) in the context of alternative mechanisms to detect novelty (Aggregate and Non-Aggregate Models). Additionally, we test a mechanism based on mixture models that uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain automatically the novelty score of a sentence.In the last part of this work we demonstrate that most novelty methods lead to a strong re-ordering of the initial ranking. However, we show that the top ranked sentences in the initial list are usually novel and re-ordering them is often harmful. Therefore, we propose different mechanisms that determine the position threshold where novelty detection should be initiated. In this respect, we consider query-independent (a fixed position for all queries) and query-dependent approaches (cluster-based and normalized-score approaches).Summing up, we identify important limitations of current sentence retrieval and novelty methods and, along this thesis, we propose alternative methods that are novel and effective.The thesis is available for download at http://www.gsi.dec.usc.es/ir/.},

abstract = {We formulate and study search algorithms that consider a user's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user's current Web search. Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search. We show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current Web search.},

These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by increasing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started to explore the possibilities and only begun to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. The workshop had an interactive format consisting of keynotes, boasters and posters, breakout groups and reports, and a final discussion, which was prolonged into the evening. There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, each of the breakout groups contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, annotations and use cases come in many different shapes and forms depending on the domain at hand, but at a higher level there are remarkable commonalities in annotation tools, indexing methods, user interfaces, and general methodology. Second, we got insights in the "exploitation" aspects, leading to a clear separation between the low-level annotations giving context or meaning to small units of information (e.g., NLP, sentiments, entities), and annotations bringing out the structure inherent in the data (e.g., sources, data schema's, document genres). Third, the plan to enrich ClueWeb with various document level (e.g., pagerank and spam scores, but also reading level) and lower level (e.g., named entities or sentiments) annotations was embraced by the workshop as a concrete next step to promote research in semantic annotations.},

abstract = {Recent recognition in IR that people engage in information seeking sessions; attempts to formally model search sessions; and, the move toward evaluation of IR systems over entire search sessions, are evidence of a new, broader understanding of IR's goals. This move takes IR's goal beyond identification of relevant information objects, to supporting people in achievement of the goal or task which led them to engage in information seeking. The emergence of the term, interactive information retrieval, the amount of research conducted under that rubric, and the lack of agreement about how to conduct and evaluate such research, testify to both the significance and the difficulty of addressing this new goal. In this new context, IR faces daunting challenges, including: understanding why people engage in information seeking; identifying aspects of that condition that need to be considered in supporting them in achieving their goals; designing support for evolving user goals and knowledge; and, perhaps most daunting, how to evaluate, in ways as rigorous and successful as IR evaluation has been to date, IR systems which attempt to address this broader goal. I, and others, have proposed that moving from relevance to usefulness as the main criterion for evaluation of IR system performance, could provide a basis for addressing many of these challenges. In this paper, I discuss how such a move might be implemented, some possible alternative means for addressing this broader goal for IR, and what serious attention to users of IR systems, and their interactions with information objects and systems, could mean for research and practice of IR.},

abstract = {IR research is now conducted in multi-media, multi-lingual, and multi-modal environments but largely in a context-free manner (Ingwersen &amp; J\"{a}rvelin, 2005). However, the retrieval of such information depends on time, place, history of interaction, task in hand, and a range of other factors that are not given explicitly but are implicit in the interaction and ambient environment, namely the context. Such contextual data can be used effectively to constrain retrieval of information thereby reducing the complexity of the retrieval process.},

abstract = {The evaluation of multimedia retrieval is a subject that has gained momentum in the last couple of years. CWI, the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands, organised a workshop organised on the subject on 24 November 2004. The main aim of the workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of multimedia retrieval to discuss the area of multimedia in general and methodology for evaluation within this area in particular. The workshop, organised by Franciska de Jong (Utwente/TNO, NL), Arjen de Vries (CWI, NL) and Thijs Westerveld (CWI, NL) was an informal half-day meeting without papers or proceedings. Because the workshop was co-located with Thijs Westerveld's PhD defence, we were able to invite Alex Hauptmann (CMU, PA, USA) to give a talk. In total six speakers were invited to present their work related to the evaluation of multimedia retrieval. The workshop started with a talk presenting multimedia retrieval in practise. Then, three talks discussed experiments in the laboratory context of the TRECVID video retrieval benchmark. The afternoon ended with a presentation of a study of interactive experiments and a talk discussing metrics for measuring multimedia retrieval effectiveness.},

abstract = {Recently, the machine learning community paused in a moment of self-reflection. In a widelydiscussed paper at ICLR 2018, Sculley et al. [13] wrote: "We observe that the rate of empirical advancement may not have been matched by consistent increase in the level of empirical rigor across the field as a whole." Their primary complaint is the development of a "research and publication culture that emphasizes wins" (emphasis in original), which typically means "demonstrating that a new method beats previous methods on a given task or benchmark". An apt description might be "leaderboard chasing"-and for many vision and NLP tasks, this isn't a metaphor. There are literally centralized leaderboards1 that track incremental progress, down to the fifth decimal point, some persisting over years, accumulating dozens of entries.Sculley et al. remind us that "the goal of science is not wins, but knowledge". The structure of the scientific enterprise today (pressure to publish, pace of progress, etc.) means that "winning" and "doing good science" are often not fully aligned. To wit, they cite a number of papers showing that recent advances in neural networks could very well be attributed to mundane issues like better hyperparameter optimization. Many results can't be reproduced, and some observed improvements might just be noise.},

abstract = {Literature-based discovery (LBD) research aims at finding effective computational methods for retrieving previously unknown information connections between clusters of research papers from disparate research areas. Existing methods encompass two general approaches. The first approach searches for these unknown connections by examining the textual contents of research papers. In addition to the existing textual features, the second approach incorporates structural features of scientific literatures, such as citation structures. These approaches, however, have not considered research papers' latent bibliographic metadata structures as important features that can be used for predicting previously unknown relationships between themThis thesis investigates a new graph-based LBD method that exploits the latent bibliographic metadata connections between pairs of research papers. The heterogeneous bibliographic information network is proposed as an efficient graph-based data structure for modeling the complex relationships between these metadata. In contrast to previous approaches, this method seamlessly combines textual and citation information in the form of path-based metadata features for predicting future co-citation links between research papers from disparate research fields. The results reported in this thesis provide evidence that the method is effective for reconstructing the historical literature-based discovery hypothesesThis thesis also investigates the effects of semantic modeling and topic modeling on the performance of the proposed method. For semantic modeling, a general-purpose word sense disambiguation technique is proposed to reduce the lexical ambiguity in the title and abstract of research papers. The experimental results suggest that the reduced lexical ambiguity did not necessarily lead to a better performance of the method. This thesis discusses some of the possible contributing factors to these results.Finally, topic modeling is used for learning the latent topical relations between research papers. The learned topic model is incorporated into the heterogeneous bibliographic information network graph and allows new predictive features to be learned. The results in this thesis suggest that topic modeling improves the performance of the proposed method by increasing the overall accuracy for predicting the future co-citation links between disparate research papers.},

We describe a new method for distributing the document lengths and term counts (a.k.a. within-document frequencies) of a web snapshot in a highly compressed and nonetheless quickly accessible form. Our main application is reproducibility of the behaviour of focused crawlers: by coupling our collection with the corresponding web graph compressed with WebGraph [3] we make it possible to apply text-based machine learning tools to the collection, while keeping the data set footprint small. We describe a collection based on a crawl of 100 Mpages of the .uk domain, publicly available in bundle with a Java open-source implementation of our techniques.},

abstract = {The online news landscape has been greatly affected by the emergence of user-generated content, as the general public summarise, discuss and comment upon news stories in real-time. Meanwhile, Web search engines serve millions of queries relating to news events each day, which could benefit from this new content. In this thesis, we investigate how user-generated content can enhance the news vertical aspect of a universal Web search engine, such that news-related queries can be satisfied more accurately, comprehensively and in a more timely manner. The aim is to provide end-users with an aggregate search result ranking that provides increased relevance and coverage of events for news-related queries. In particular, we focus on improving the search result ranking for those news-related queries that cannot be easily satisfied by newswire articles, either because the event that the user is searching for has just broken and hence no news articles have yet been published, or because current newswire articles are insufficiently detailed or out-of-date.To do so, we propose a news search framework to describe the news vertical aspect of a universal web search engine, comprised of four components, each providing a different piece of functionality. The top events identification component identifies the most important events that are happening at any given moment using discussion in user-generated content streams. The news query classification component classifies incoming queries as news-related or not in real-time. The ranking news-related content component finds and ranks relevant content for news-related user queries from multiple streams of news and user-generated content. Finally, the news-related content integration component aggregates the previously ranked content for the user query into the Web search ranking.For each component, we propose novel approaches that use user-generated content to enhance each. In particular, for top events identification, we propose a fully automatic real-time approach for the identification of currently important news-related events based upon voting theory. For news query classification, we propose a real-time classification approach that leverages recent discussions from multiple parallel news and user-generated content sources. To rank news-related content, we experiment with novel machine learned approaches that leverage the unique characteristics of the different user-generated sources used when ranking. Meanwhile, for news-related content integration, we adapt resource selection techniques to select and integrate the content ranked from different news and user-generated sources into an enhanced ranking to display to the end-user.We thoroughly evaluate these proposed approaches using standard TREC test collections (where possible) in addition to new evaluation datasets developed using crowdsourcing. Indeed, to facilitate our evaluation, we generated over 60,000 individual crowdsourced assessments. Moreover, we also performed a large-scale crowdsourced user-study examining whether users prefer the aggregate rankings produced by our news search framework in comparison to traditional Web search results. We show that user-generated content-enhanced approaches can effectively rank events by their current importance/newsworthiness; improve news-query classification accuracy; return additional relevant content for news-related queries in real-time (facilitating more comprehensive coverage of events); and enhance Web search rankings with additional content that end-users find useful. We conclude that user-generated content is indeed a very useful source of information to use in order to enhance a news vertical.This thesis opens up multiple promising directions for future research in the fields of news/social search, real-time classification and vertical integration, while providing new viable crowdsourced methodologies to evaluate approaches in these fields.Available Online at http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3813.},

abstract = {In the context of creating large scale test collections, the present paper discusses methods of constructing a patent test collection for evaluation of prior art search. In particular, it addresses criteria for topic selection and identification of recall bases. These issues arose while organizing the CLEF-IP evaluation track and were the subject of an online discussion among the track's organizers and its steering committee. Most literature on building test collections is concerned with minimizing the costs of obtaining relevance assessments. CLEF-IP can afford to have large topics sets since relevance assessments are generated by exploiting existing manually created information. In a cost-benefit analysis, the only issue seems to be the computing time required by participants to run (tens or hundreds of) thousands of queries. This document describes the data sets and decisions leading to the creation of the CLEF-IP collection.},

abstract = {XML is increasingly used to mark up content in present day information repositories. Over the last decade or so, retrieval from XML document collections has emerged as an area of active research. For the Information Retrieval community, XML retrieval poses a two-fold problem: finding effective techniques to retrieve appropriate or the most useful XML elements in response to a user query; anddevising an appropriate evaluation methodology to measure the effectivity of such retrieval techniques..This study examines both these issues. First, we revisited the pivoted length normalization scheme in the Vector Space Model using standard benchmark collections for XML retrieval. We reduced two parameters used in pivoted length normalization to a single combined parameter and experimentally found its optimum value, which works well at both the element and document levels for XML retrieval.We observed that a substantial number of focused queries used in XML retrieval clearly state, besides the information need, what the user does not want. We demonstrated that this negative information, if not handled properly, degrades retrieval performance. We proposed a solution for automatically removing negative information from XML queries. This led to significant improvements in retrieval results.On the evaluation of XML retrieval, we first studied the sensitivity &amp; robustness of various evaluation metrics and reliability and reusability of the assessment pool that has been used at INEX Ad Hoc track since 2007. Specifically we investigated the behaviour of the metrics when assessments are incomplete, or when query sets are small. We observed that early precision metrics are more error-prone and less stable under both these conditions. Average metric, however, performs comparatively better in this respect. System rankings remain largely unaffected even when assessment effort is substantially (but systematically) reduced. We also found that the INEX collections remain usable when evaluating non-participating systems.For a fixed amount of assessment effort, judging shallow pools for many queries is found to be better than judging deep pools for a smaller set of queries. However, when judging only a random sample of a pool, it is better to completely judge fewer topics than to partially judge many topics.We also proposed a simple and pragmatic approach of creating assessment pool for evaluation of retrieval systems. Instead of using an apriori-fixed pool depth for all topics, the pool is incrementally built and judged interactively on a per query basis. When no new relevant document is found for a reasonably long run of pool-depths, pooling was stopped for the topic. Our proposed approach offers a trade-off between the available effort and required level of performance. Moreover, it is flexible to deep pooling for potential topics in order to ensure better estimate of recall. We demonstrated the effectivity of the technique by substantially reducing the assessment effort without seriously compromising on the reliability of evaluation. The approach provided good results in the evaluation of XML retrieval as well as traditional document retrieval.This doctoral work was done at and submitted to the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, under the supervision of Dr. Mandar Mitra. Dr. Ellen Voorhees and Dr. Tetsuya Sakai served as reviewers; Dr. Soumen Chakrabarti was the examiner at the defence of the thesis.Available online at http://www.isical.ac.in/?mandar/sukomal-thesis.pdf.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Web- and social media-based photo-sharing applications have not only opened many possibilities but also resulted in new needs and challenges. They have resulted in a large amount of personal photos being available for public access. One of the most interesting characteristics of these data is that they are surrounded by 1) textual annotations, also called tags, which are intended to describe and categorize, by collective user efforts, the uploaded resources 2) temporal information referring to when a pictures has been taken and often by 3) a locational information describing where the picture has been taken. Despite the recent developments and technological advances in Web-based mediasharing applications, the continuously increasing amount of available information has made the access to the photos a demanding task. In general, we can address this challenge by allowing photo collections to be organized and browsed through the concept of events. We also believe most users are familiar with searching photo collections using events as starting points.Aiming at supporting the detection and search of event-related photos, this thesis proposes a novel framework for extracting pictures related to real-life events from a collection of Web-images by leveraging on their temporal geographical and textual annotations and comparing the proposed approach with existing related state-of-the-art approaches. Second, a set of geographical features is proposed describing the characteristics of the geographical profile of query terms deriving concepts from exploratory analysis. Third, the thesis provides two different tag-based search framework to improve the effectiveness of searching images related to events. The first framework is based on temporal and geographical proximity of query terms to the temporal neighbours of a given timestamped query, while the second framework is based on a novel machine-learning based query expansion method combining the heterogeneous textual, temporal and geographical similarity between query terms and candidate expansion terms for the selection of the expansion terms given a free text textual query.All the proposed methods have been evaluated by performing extensive experiments on real data gathered from media-sharing applications on the Web. Where possible, comparison with related techniques has been performed to reinforce the validity of the presented approaches. The proposed methods have shown promising results in both the extraction and clustering of event-related images and searching event-related pictures by using metrics from the state of the art.This doctoral work has been performed at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) under advise of Associate Professor Heri Ramampiaro and with co-supervisors Associate Professor Roger Midtstraum and Associate Professor Randi Karlsen. Professor Ramesh Jain (University of California Irvine), Assistant Professor Claudia Hauff (TU Delft) and Associate Professor Trond Aalberg (NTNU) served as dissertation committee members.Available online at: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/research/doctor_theses/ruocco.pdf.},

abstract = {This thesis has developed a theoretical framework to evaluate XML retrieval. XML retrieval deals with retrieving those document parts that specifically answer a query. It is concerned with using the document structure to improve the retrieval of information from documents by only delivering those parts of a document an information need is about. We define a theoretical evaluation methodology based on the idea of 'aboutness' and apply it to XML retrieval models.Situation Theory is used to express the aboutness proprieties of XML retrieval models. We propose a Situation Theory framework to evaluate XML retrieval, which is based on the basic and most general information retrieval question how a document (or in our case an XML element) can be about a query. This framework allows us to compare and analyze the reasoning behaviour of XML retrieval models experimented within INEX evaluation campaigns. We develop a dedicated methodology for the evaluation of XML retrieval and apply this methodology to five XML retrieval models from INEX. For each model we derive functional and qualitative properties that qualify its formal behaviour. We compare this behaviour with the underlying flat document retrieval model as well as with a model we specially design to determine how much an XML retrieval model includes XML structure in its reasoning behaviour.More INEX specific, this thesis further investigates the use of our theoretical evaluation methodology to describe the INEX evaluation methodology. We exemplify theoretical models of user agents and assessment procedures in INEX and derive reasoning assumptions that are included in the specific XML retrieval experimental evaluation, its scales and the ways assessments are done. We point to potential inconsistencies and make suggestions for alternative views on the experimental evaluation dimensions for XML retrieval. Further INEX specifics are discussed when we theoretically analyse filters, as they are used in INEX to deliver only specific answers to an information need. We introduce our theoretical methodology to analyse filters as special aboutness decisions, before applying it to the XML retrieval filtering models.We finally use the theoretical properties of XML retrieval models and their filters to explain experimental results obtained with some of the XML retrieval models within INEX and draw upon all our previous results to demonstrate how theoretical evaluation insights can be used to explain results from mainstream experimental evaluations. We relate our theoretical evaluation results with the experimental ones for XML retrieval to find out how the adjustment of existing flat document retrieval models compares to the creation of completely new ones, especially designed to meet the requirements of XML retrieval. For each of the XML retrieval experimental evaluation tasks, we shall determine the reasoning properties that support a good performance and discuss on this basis the experimental performance of the XML retrieval models.An updated version of the thesis will appear with IOS-Press: Tobias Blanke, Using Situation Theory to evaluate XML Retrieval, IOS-Press: Amsterdam, 2012.},

abstract = {This thesis presents research towards a core aim of information retrieval (IR): providing users with easy access to information. Three research themes guide the research presented in this thesis, contributing to three aspects of IR research: the domain in which an IR system is used, the users interacting with the system, and the different access scenarios in which these users engage with an IR system. Central to these research themes is the aim to gain insights into the behavior of searchers and develop algorithms to support them in their quest, whether it is a researcher exploring or studying a large collection, a web searcher struggling to find something, or a television viewer searching for related content.The first research theme is motivated by the information seeking tasks of researchers exploring and studying large collections. To enable their search on a larger scale, we propose computational methods to connect collections and to infer the perspective offered in a news story. Motivated by how historians select documents for close reading, we propose novel methods for connecting collections using automatically extracted temporal references. To illustrate how these algorithms can be used to automatically create connections between collections, we introduce a novel search interface to explore and analyze the connected collections. The interface highlights different perspectives and requires little domain knowledge. Based on how communication scientists study framing in news, we propose an automatic thematic content analysis approach.The second research theme is addressed in a mixed-methods study on how web searchers behave when they cannot find what they are looking for. Based on large-scale log analysis, crowd-sourced labeling, and predictive modeling we show behavioral differences given task success and failure. Based on these findings we propose ways in which systems can reduce struggling in search. To support searchers, we propose and evaluate algorithms that accurately predict the nature of future actions and their anticipated impact on search outcomes. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems that help searchers struggle less and succeed more.In the third and final research theme, we consider a pro-active search scenario, specifically in a live television setting. We propose algorithms that leverage contextual information to retrieve diverse related content for a leaned-back TV viewer. While watching television, people increasingly consume additional content related to what they are watching. Two methods to automatically retrieve content based on subtitles are introduced, one using entity linking, and one that uses reinforcement learning to generate effective queries for finding related content. Both methods are highly efficient and are currently used in a live television setting in near real time.Each research chapter in this thesis provides insights and algorithms that help searchers when using IR applications. For varying domains, users, and access scenarios, the research presented in this thesis improves the ease of access to information.},

Selective search creates topical shards that are deliberately content-skewed, placing highly similar documents together in the same shard. During query time, rather than searching the entire corpus, a resource selection algorithm selects a subset of the topic shards likely to contain documents relevant to the query and search is only performed on these shards. This substantially reduces total computational costs of search while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive distributed search.},

abstract = {A concept hierarchy is a set of concepts and relations between those concepts. Since ancient times, concept hierarchies have been used to organize and access information. In some situations, task-specific and user-specific concept hierarchies are necessary to allow an overview and easy access a large set of documents. For example, in regulatory reforms, rule-makers in government regulatory agencies must quickly identify and respond to issues raised in public comments. A concept hierarchy constructed for a set of public comments hierarchically organizes the comments and a user is able to easily "drill down" into documents that discuss a specific topic.Particularly, this dissertation addresses how to construct concept hierarchies from text collections automatically or with a-human-in-the-loop. The novel metric-based concept hierarchy construction framework transforms concept hierarchy construction into a multicriterion optimization problem. It incrementally clusters concepts based on minimum evolution of hierarchy structure, as well as optimization derived from the modeling of concept abstractness and concept coherence. Moreover, this dissertation represents the semantic distance between concepts as a wide range of features, each of which corresponds to a state-ofthe- art concept hierarchy construction technique, such as lexico-syntactic pattern, contextual information, and co-occurrence. The use of multiple features allows a further study of the interaction between features and different types of semantic relations as well as the interaction between features and concepts at different abstraction levels.Besides the automatic framework for concept hierarchy construction, this dissertation also proposes an effective human-guided concept hierarchy construction framework to address personalization by learning from periodic manual guidance and directing the learned models towards personal preferences. Through human-computer interactions, the human and the machine work together to organize concepts into hierarchies. The machine's predictions not only save the user's effort but also make sensible suggestions to assist the user. This is one of the first works of real-time machine learning for organizing personalized information in an interactive paradigm.This dissertation also studies user behaviors during concept hierarchy construction. It explores whether people create concept hierarchies more quickly or more consistently using the proposed frameworks, whether there are consistent dataset-specific or user-specific differences in the hierarchies that people construct, whether people are self-consistent, and how these factors interact with different construction methods. The user study elaborates that dataset difficulty is a major factor affecting how people organize information into concept hierarchies. It also reveals that people are quite self-consistent in building hierarchies. This novel finding provides foundations to study the differences in concept hierarchy construction behaviors between individuals.Last but not least, the dissertation proposes a novel similarity metric for measuring hierarchy similarity. Fragment-based Similarity (FBS) employs a unique bag-of-word representation for hierarchies and takes a fragment-based view to calculate hierarchy similarity. FBS well approximates tree edit distance and greatly improves tree edit distance's efficiency from NP-hard to only O(n3) and O(n) if pairwise node similarities are pre-calculated.The research in this dissertation is an important step forward of concept hierarchy construction. It addresses important problems of concept hierarchy construction, especially considers how to better model these problems with good theoretical foundations, to study these problems via extensive empirical experiments and user studies, and to solve these problems by developing practical applications for constructing personal concept hierarchies.

abstract = {Modern cities are increasingly becoming smart where a digital knowledge infrastructure is deployed by local authorities (e.g. City councils and municipalities) to better serve the information needs of their citizens, and to ensure the sustainability and efficient use of power and resources. This knowledge infrastructure consists of a wide range of systems from lowlevel physical sensors to advanced sensing devices through social sensors. The i-ASC 2014 workshop was the first international event, within the Information Retrieval (IR) community, that is dedicated to research on smart/future cities. In particular, the workshop was a venue for research on digesting the city's data streams and knowledge databases in order to serve the information needs of citizens and support decision making for local authorities. Possible use cases include helping tourists to find interesting places to go or activities to do while visiting a city, or assisting journalists in reporting local incidents. Indeed, the workshop was intended to foster the development of new information access and retrieval models that can harness effectively and efficiently the large number of heterogeneous big data streams in a city to provide a new generation of information services. The workshop was well attended, where more than 45 participants were officially registered. It featured two keynote talks from industry (IBM andWaag Society) and two invited talks from academia (Pisa and Edinburgh). In addition, seven refereed papers were presented before breakout groups considered questions and issues identified from a panel discussion.},

abstract = {Daily amount of news reporting real-world events is growing exponentially. At the same time, Organizations are looking for information about current and past events that affects them, such as mergers and acquisitions of companies. The Organizations need to obtain event information in a fast and summarized form to make decisions. Event-based retrieval and summarization systems offer an efficient solution to this problem. Most summarization research work uses news stories. Although this type of documents is characterized by conveying information about events, almost all work concentrates on approaches that do not take into account this aspect.The proposed multi-document summarization methods are based on the hierarchical combination of single-document summaries. We improved our multi-document summarization methods using event information. Our approach is based on a two-stage single-document method that extracts a collection of key phrases, which are then used in a centrality-asrelevance passage retrieval model. To adapt centrality-as-relevance single-document summarization for multi-document summarization that is able to use event information, we needed a good and adaptable baseline system. Because the key phrase extraction play a significant role in the summarization, we improved a state-of-the-art key phrase extraction toolkit using four additional sets of semantic features. The event detection method is based on Fuzzy Fingerprint, which is a supervised method trained on documents with annotated event tags. We explored three different ways to integrate event information, achieving state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-document summarization using filtering and event-based features. To cope with the possible usage of different terms to describe the same event, we explored distributed representations of text in the form of word embeddings, which contributed to improve the multi-document summarization results.The automatic evaluation and user study performed show that these methods improve upon current state-of-the-art multi-document summarization systems on two mainstream evaluation datasets, DUC 2007 and TAC 2009. We show a relative improvement in ROUGE- 1 scores of 16% for TAC 2009 and of 17% for DUC 2007. We have also obtained improvements in ROUGE-1 upon current state-of-the-art single-document summarization systems of between 32% in clean data and 19% in noisy data. These improvements derived from the inclusion of key phrases and event information. The extraction of key phrases was also refined with additional pre-processing steps and features, which lead to a relative improvement in NDCG scores of 9%. The introduction of Fuzzy Fingerprints for event detection enabled the detection of all event types, while the best competitor, an SVM with enhanced features, only detects roughly 85% of the different types of events. This lead to a large increase in the G-Mean and variants results when using the Fuzzy Fingerprints method.This doctoral work was carried under the Dual Ph.D. program in Languages and Information Technologies of Carnegie Mellon Portugal Program. The program took place at both the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and at the Department of Computer of Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior T\'{e}cnico (IST).

abstract = {Visual data exploration is a well-known technique in the data mining toolbox for analyzing and understanding large amounts of data. In information retrieval, visualization is still perceived as a front-end or user facing feature while, at the same time, it can be very effective in the back-end for data analysis. Currently, the research community does not sufficiently analyze the reasons underlying the assessments they use for evaluation, which may lead to bias or error when reporting system performance. In this paper we examine the integration of information visualization techniques for visually exploring and analyzing relevance assessments. We argue that visual tools should be integrated as a core component of the infrastructure for relevance assessment and evaluation.},

abstract = {In the modern world, networked sensor technology makes it possible to capture the world around us in real-time. In the security domain cameras are an important source of information. Cameras in public places, bodycams, drones and recordings with smart phones are used for real time monitoring of the environment to prevent crime (monitoring case); and/or for investigation and retrieval of crimes, for example in evidence forensics (forensic case). In both cases it is required to quickly obtain the right information, without having to manually search through the data. Currently, many algorithms are available to index a video with some pre-trained concepts, such as people, objects and actions. These algorithms require a representative and large enough set of examples (training data) to recognize the concept. This training data is, however, not always present. In this thesis, we aim to assist an analyst in their work on video stream data by providing a search capability that handles ad-hoc textual queries, i.e. queries that include concepts or events that are not pre-trained. We use the security domain as inspiration for our work, but the analyst can be working in any application domain that uses video stream data, or even indexed data. Additionally, we do only consider the technical aspects of the search capability and not on the legal, ethical or privacy issues related to video stream data. We focus on the retrieval of high-level events, such as birthday parties. We assume that these events can be composed of smaller pre-trained concepts, such as a group of people, a cake and decorations and relations between those concepts, to capture the essence of that unseen event (decompositionality assumption). Additionally, we hold the open world assumption, i.e. the system does not have complete world knowledge. Although current state of the art systems are able to detect an increasingly large number of concepts, this number still falls far behind the near infinite number of possible (textual) queries that a system needs to be able to handle. In our aim to assist the analyst, we focus on the improvement of the visual search effectiveness (e.g. performance) by a semantic query-to-concept mapping: the mapping from the user query to the set of pre-trained concepts. We use the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection benchmark, as it contains high-level events inspired by the security domain. In this thesis, we show that the main improvements can be achieved by using a combination of i) queryto- concept mapping based on semantic word embeddings (+12%), ii) exploiting user feedback (+26%) and iii) fusion of different modalities (data sources) (+17%). First, we propose an incremental word2vec (i-w2v) method [1], which uses word2vec trained on GoogleNews items as a semantic embedding model and incrementally adds concepts to the set of selected concepts for a query in order to deal with query drift. This method improve performance in terms of MAP compared to the state of the art word2vec method and knowledge based techniques. In combination with a state of the art video event retrieval pipeline, we achieve top performance on the TRECVID MED benchmark regarding the zero-example task (MED14Test results). This improvement is, however, dependent on the availability of the concepts in the Concept Bank: without concepts related to or occurring in the event, we cannot detect the event. We, thus, need a properly composed Concept Bank to properly index videos. Second, we propose an Adaptive Relevance Feedback interpretation method named ARF [2] that not only achieves high retrieval performance, but is also theoretically founded through the Rocchio algorithm from the text retrieval field. This algorithm is adjusted to the event retrieval domain in a way that the weights for the concepts are changed based on the positive and negative annotations on videos. The ARF method has higher visual search effectiveness compared to k-NN based methods on video level annotations and methods based on concept level annotations. Third, we propose blind late fusion methods that are based on state of the art methods [3], such as average fusion or fusion based on probabilities. Especially the combination of a Joint Ratio (ratio of probabilities) and Extreme Ratio (ratio of minimum and maximum) method (JRER) achieves high performance in cases with reliable detectors, i.e. enough training examples. This method is not only applicable to the video retrieval field, but also in sensor fusion in general. Although future work can be done in the direction of implicit query-to-concept mapping through deep learning methods, smartly combining the concepts and the usage of spatial and temporal information, we have shown that our proposed methods can improve the visual search effectiveness by a semantic query-to-concept mapping which brings us a step closer to a search capability that handles ad-hoc textual queries for analysts.},

abstract = {Although there has been a great deal of research into Collaborative Information Retrieval/Seeking (CIR/S), the majority has assumed that team members in a collaborative search team always have the same level of unrestricted access to information. However, observations from different domains such as healthcare, business, government, etc. have suggested that collaboration sometimes involves people with differing levels of access to information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level Collaborative Information Retrieval (MLCIR). As well as a support for collaboration, MLCIR must consider information flow, security and shareability between collaborators. Therefore, existing CIR/S interface components and concepts (e.g. awareness, division of labour, persistence, etc.) may not be directly applicable to MLCIR. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any systematic evaluations to investigate the impact of MLCIR on search outcomes and to provide user-centred design recommendations for MLCIR interfaces. To address this gap, a number of studies were conducted using real-world MLCIR examples as scenarios. This thesis highlights four research objectives; these are: 1) to investigate the impact of different collaborative search strategies and MLCIR scenarios on search outcomes using a user simulation approach, 2) to develop a preliminary MLCIR interface and investigate the impact of MLCIR scenarios on search outcomes using a user study, 3) to investigate the impact of existing CIR concepts on MLCIR search outcomes using a user study, and 4) to develop and evaluate a working prototype of an MLCIR interface that supports users for asynchronous collaboration. These investigations followed an iterative approach until a final MLCIR interface could be produced. The first study was a user simulated study which allowed us to test a large number of variables and to pick prominent ones for further user studies. It was found that when relevance feedback search strategies were used, search performance of non-full access (where team members had 90% access to collection) outperformed full access (where team members had 100% access to collection). This simulated study also fulfilled the first research objective. Next, a preliminary user study was conducted using variables selected based on the findings of the simulated study. This study uncovered a number of interface components, and awareness concepts such as query awareness, result awareness and team awareness that could be used to support users in MLCIR scenarios. This user study addressed the second research objective. Based on findings from this user study, two further user studies were conducted where we evaluated a number of interface components implemented to support query awareness, result awareness and team awareness. Results suggested that having access to query properties and result properties in MLCIR scenarios can leverage team members? search performance. These two user studies addressed the third research objective. Finally, a working MLCIR interface was built based on the findings elicited from our previous user studies. The interface was then evaluated using the web and non-uniform information access scenarios. The results showed that blacklisting search terms had a significant negative impact on search outcome than blacklisting documents (f-measure: 0.04 vs 0.197). This study fulfilled the final research objective. All five studies presented in this thesis provided us with an increasing understanding of how to develop an MLCIR interface that is usable and helpful for users. As a final product, a working MLCIR interface was produced which could provide collaborating users with useful awareness information without disclosing any sensitive data. Overall, this thesis provided important new design suggestions and showed reusability of CIR components for MLCIR interfaces, something that has never been demonstrated before. The interfaces, experimental designs and findings including design suggestions that are presented in this thesis serve as novel guidelines for further investigations into MLCIR.},

abstract = {At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the web entered a phase of explosive growth. Since then, a multitude of platforms has become available for users to publish information, communicate with others, connect to like-minded individuals, and share anything that they want to share. These platforms are commonly known as social media. Social media enables many-to-many communication: many people can create content, which in turn can be read by many others. To make interesting content findable for many people, machines need to be able to identify the "right" pieces of content or the "appropriate" content creators. That is, we need ways to intelligently access information in social media.The main motivation for the research in my thesis is that we want to enable intelligent access to, and analysis of, the information contained in social media. To this end, we must determine the topical relevance of social media documents, while countering the specific challenges posed by their noisy and creative nature. We identify two entry points for accessing information in social media: (i) the people creating the social media and (ii) their individual utterances (e.g., blog posts, tweets). These entry points act as a doorway to the information in social media. The aim of the thesis is to improve searching for people and their utterances in social media, thereby offering intelligent access to the information it contains.In the thesis we explore ways to improve retrieval effectiveness, for both people and their utterances, in five research chapters. We start with an extensive analysis of the query logs of a people search engine and show that users are mainly interested in finding social media profiles of people for whom they search. We continue with our focus on searching for people in the second chapter, but adopt a more technical perspective. We use blog posts as representation of bloggers' interests and show that for blogger finding a combination of two models, one based on individual blog posts and one on aggregated blogger models, is both effective and efficient.In the remaining three chapters we move away from finding people and focus on individual utterances. Specifically, we look at blog post retrieval in two chapters and email retrieval in mailing lists in the last chapter. For blog post retrieval we explore the use of indicators obtained from a credibility framework. We propose ways of estimating these indicators and rerank an initial list of blog posts based on these (combined) indicator scores. We find that incorporating these indicators leads to improvements and our analysis determines indicators that are most influential.The second chapter on blog post retrieval and the chapter on email search both use a notion of "context" to help improve retrieval effectiveness. For blog post retrieval we observe that much of what is written in blog posts is based on things happening the bloggers' environments. To use this observation we propose a generative retrieval model that uses information from a set of external sources. We test our model using a news collection, Wikipedia, and a web collection as external sources. We find that our model is capable of improving retrieval performance on most topics and that the per-topic collection importance is a very useful component of the model. Finally, the last research chapter uses the direct context of emails to refine queries; we explore the use of threads, the entire mailing list, and the pages from within the same community as sources for query expansion terms. Besides that, we also incorporate the previously mentioned credibility-inspired indicators in this setting. We find that context helps in improving retrieval performance, as do the credibilityinspired indicators.Concluding, my thesis provides new insights into search behavior in social media and shows that a diverse set of methods can help improve retrieval effectiveness for multiple information access tasks within social media.Available online at http://wouter.weerkamp.com/.},

The retrieval task in the track is a traditional ad hoc retrieval task where the evaluation methodology emphasizes a system's least effective topics. The most promising approach to improving poorly performing topics is exploiting text collections other than the target collection such as the web.The track has also investigated appropriate evaluation measures to support the focus on ineffective topics. Traditional measure are dominated by the better-performing topics, and the first two measures used in the track that do emphasize the poorly performing topics are unstable in practice. A third measure, a variant of the traditional MAP measure that uses a geometric mean rather than an arithmetic mean to average individual topic results, shows promise of giving appropriate emphasis to poorly performing topics while being more stable at equal topic set sizes.},

abstract = {The Web has profoundly changed the way we access information. The increase in the amount of information available and the easy access to the Web have contributed to the popularity of search in this medium. While this is true in several domains, it is particularly significant in the health domain. In fact, search for health information is the third most popular online activity and it is performed by almost 3 out of 4 American Internet users. Besides its popularity, health web search is particularly important to inform health consumers, encouraging them to become more participatory in their health management. In the health domain, the context surrounding the search is extremely rich and we believe it can contribute to improve system's performance. Although information retrieval has made significant progresses supporting its retrieval methods solely on the query and document collection, it has been recognized that context should be explored. Context can, for example, be used to disambiguate a query, to retrieve documents adjusted to the expertise of the searcher or to adjust documents to the patient's medical record.In this dissertation we investigate the effects of context features in consumer health information retrieval. In addition, we propose and evaluate strategies to use context features in query formulation support. The popularity of web search on the health domain made us focus on Web retrieval. We opt to concentrate on health consumers due to the lack of research focusing on this specific public. The thesis behind our work is that consumer health information retrieval is affected by context features, which can be used in query formulation support to improve retrieval performance.In three exploratory studies, we analyze how a large number of features affect different outcomes of the retrieval process. Based on findings from these studies and on the importance of query formulation support in a domain where terminology can be a barrier and translations to other languages are not always obvious, we explored the impact of query translations in users with different characteristics. Based on the assumption that a query using a language that is popular on the Web may easily reach high-quality contents, one study analyzes the effects of translating a query to the English language in users with different levels of English proficiency. Findings show that users having, at least, elementary English proficiency benefit from English query suggestions. The other studies focus on query terminology translation, that is, translation between lay and medico-scientific terminology, considering users' health literacy and topic familiarity. Although several strategies have been previously proposed to overcome the terminology gap between health consumers and web documents, none considers users health literacy and topic familiarity. Findings suggest that users with inadequate health literacy and users who are unfamiliar with the topic should be provided with recommendations of lay queries. On the other hand, users with higher health literacy or higher topic familiarity should be given alternative queries using medico-scientific terminology.Based on the above findings, we developed a query suggestion system that, using domain information gathered from an existing consumer health vocabulary, identifies the medical concepts included in the query and returns four types of suggestions combining the Portuguese or English languages with the lay or medico-scientific terminologies. We found that suggestions offered by the system had a good acceptance, with English suggestions being preferred to Portuguese ones in basic and proficient users and medico-scientific suggestions being preferred to lay ones in higher levels of health literacy. We concluded that a retrieval system including the implemented suggestion strategy without any kind of personalization tends to be better than a system without suggestions with respect to precision, correctness of the resulting knowledge and also of its incorrectness. We also concluded that this system tends to be slightly worse in terms of motivational relevance. Of these, only the incorrectness difference is significant. This is extremely relevant in the health domain where incorrect information can have serious consequences. Moreover, we also found that the personalization of this system to users' English proficiency and health literacy, biasing users towards the suggestions more beneficial to them, outperforms the system without personalization, in terms of medical accuracy of the obtained knowledge.},

abstract = {The BooksOnline Workshop series aims to foster the discussion and exchange of research ideas and initiatives addressing challenges and exploring opportunities around large collections of digital books and complementary media. The third workshop in the series, BooksOnline' 10 boosted a high quality program, including keynote addresses by James Crawford from Google Books and John Mark Ockerbloom from the University of Pennsylvania. From the accepted papers two main themes emerged: 1) Issues relating to building suitable infrastructure for online book collections and for the evaluation of the applications and services that make use of such collections, and 2) Opportunities relating to the social or collaborative reading and annotation of books and issues relating to the design of suitable eReaders. This paper provides a summary of the workshop and the accepted contributions.},

abstract = {Question Answering (QA) is the task of searching a large text collection for specific answers to questions posed in natural language. Though they often have access to rich linguistic and semantic analyses of their input questions, QA systems often rely on off-theshelf bag-of-words Information Retrieval (IR) solutions to retrieve passages matching a set of terms extracted from the question.There is a fundamental disconnect between the capabilities of the bag-of-words retrieval model and the retrieval needs of the QA system. Bag-of-words IR retrieves documents matching a query, but the QA system really needs documents that contain answers. Through question analysis, the QA system has compiled a sophisticated information need representation for what constitutes an answer to the question. This representation is composed of a set of linguistic and semantic constraints satisfied by answer-bearing passages. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf IR libraries commonly used in QA systems can not, in general, check these types of constraints at query-time. Poor quality retrieval can cause a QA system to fail if no answer-bearing text is retrieved, if it is not ranked highly enough, or if it is outranked or overwhelmed by false positives, text that matches the query well, yet supports a wrong answer.This thesis proposes two linguistic and semantic passage retrieval methods for QA, one based on structured retrieval and the other on rank-learning techniques. In addition, a methodology is proposed for mapping annotated text consisting of labeled spans and typed relations between them into an annotation graph representation. The annotation graph supports query-time linguistic and semantic constraint-checking, and serves as a unifying formalism for the QA system's information need and for retrieved passages. The proposed methods rely only on the relatively weak assumption that the QA system's information need can be represented as an annotation graph. The two approaches are shown to retrieve more answer-bearing text, more highly ranked, compared to a bag-of-words baseline for two different QA tasks. Linguistic and semantic passage retrieval methods are also shown to improve end-to-end QA system accuracy and answer MRR.Available online at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mbilotti/thesis.pdf.},

abstract = {This thesis focuses on enhancing the search of electronic medical records (EMRs), with the aim of identifying patients with medical histories relevant to the medical conditions stated in a text query. During retrieval, a healthcare practitioner indicates a number of inclusion criteria describing the medical conditions of the patients of interest. However, finding patients with particular medical conditions is challenging, due to the implicit knowledge inherent within the patients' medical records and queries - such knowledge may be known by medical practitioners, but may be hidden from an information retrieval (IR) system. For instance, the mention of a treatment such as a drug may indicate to a practitioner that a particular diagnosis has been made for the patient, but this diagnosis may not be explicitly mentioned in the patient's medical records. Moreover, the use of negated language (e.g. 'without', 'no') to describe a medical condition of a patient (e.g. the patient has no fever) may cause a search system to erroneously retrieve that patient for a query when searching for patients with that medical condition (e.g. find patients with fever). To attain effective retrieval performance, we hypothesise that, in a patient search system, both the information needs and patients' histories should be represented based upon the medical decision process. In particular, this thesis argues that since the medical decision process typically encompasses four aspects (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment), a patient search system should take into account these aspects and apply inferences to recover the possible implicit knowledge. We postulate that considering these aspects and their derived implicit knowledge at three different levels of the retrieval process (namely, sentence, medical record and interrecord levels) enhances the retrieval performance. Indeed, we propose a novel framework that can gain insights from EMRs and queries, by modelling and reasoning upon informationduring retrieval in terms of the four aforementioned aspects at the three levels of the retrieval process, and can use these insights to enhance patient search.Firstly, at the sentence level, we extract the medical conditions in the medical records and queries. In particular, we propose to represent only the medical conditions related to the four medical aspects in order to improve the accuracy of our search system. In addition, we identify the context (negative/positive) of terms, which leads to an accurate representation of the medical conditions both in the EMRs and queries. In particular, we aim to prevent patients whose EMRs state the medical conditions in the contexts different from the query from being ranked highly. For example, preventing patients whose EMRs state "no history of dementia" from being retrieved for a query searching for patients with dementia.Secondly, at the medical record level, using external knowledge-based resources (e.g. ontologies and health-related websites), we leverage the relationships between medical terms to infer the wider medical history of the patient in terms of the four medical aspects. In particular, we estimate the relevance of a patient to the query by exploiting association rules that we extract from the semantic relationships between medical terms using the four aspects of the medical process. For example, patients with a medical history involving a CABG surgery (treatment) can be inferred as relevant to a query searching for a patient suffering from heart disease (diagnosis), since a CABG surgery is a treatment of heart disease.Thirdly, at the inter-record level, we enhance the retrieval of patients in two different manners. First, we exploit knowledge about how the four medical aspects are handled by different hospital departments to gain a better understanding about the appropriateness of EMRs created by different departments for a given query. We propose to aggregate EMRs at the department level (i.e. inter-record level) to extract implicit knowledge (i.e. the expertise of each department) and model this department's expertise, while ranking patients. For instance, patients having EMRs from the cardiology department are likely to be relevant to a query searching for patients who suffered from a heart attack. Second, as a medical query typically contains several medical conditions that the relevant patients should satisfy, we propose to explicitly model the relevance towards multiple query medical conditions in the EMRs related to a particular patient during retrieval. In particular, we rank highly those patients that match all the stated medical conditions in the query by adapting coverage-based diversification approaches originally proposed for the web search domain.Finally, we examine the combination of our aforementioned approaches that exploit the implicit knowledge at the three levels of the retrieval process to further improve the retrieval performance by adapting techniques from the fields of data fusion and machine learning. In particular, data fusion techniques, such as CombSUM and CombMNZ, are used to combine the relevance scores computed by the different approaches of the proposed framework. On the other hand, we deploy state-of-the-art learning to rank approaches (e.g. LambdaMART and AdaRank) to learn from a set of training data an effective combination of the relevance scores computed by the approaches of the framework. In addition, we introduce a novel selective ranking approach that uses a classifier to effectively apply one of the approaches of the framework on a per-query basis.This thesis draws insights from a thorough evaluation and analysis of the proposed framework using a standard test collection provided by the TREC Medical Records track. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the framework. In particular, the results demonstrate the importance of dealing with the implicit knowledge in patient search by focusing on the medical decision criteria aspects at the three levels of the retrieval process.},

abstract = {Data analysis requires new approaches in many domains for evaluating tools and techniques, particularly when the data sets grow large and more complex. Evaluation-as-service (EaaS) was coined as a term to represent evaluation approaches based on APIs, virtual machines or source code submission, different from the common paradigm of evaluating techniques on a distributed test collection, tasks and submitted results files. Such new approaches become necessary when data sets become extremely large, contain confidential information or might change quickly over time. The workshop on cloud-based evaluation (CBE) took place in Boston, MA, USA on November 5, 2015 and explored several approaches for data analysis evaluation and frameworks in this field. The objective was to include several stakeholders from academic partners, companies to funding agencies to cover various interests and viewpoints in the discussion of evaluation infrastructures. The workshop focused on the biomedical domain but the results are easily applicable to many domains of information analysis and retrieval.},
