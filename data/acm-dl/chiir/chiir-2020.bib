abstract = {Enthusiasm for big data is obscuring the complexity and diversity of data in scholarship and the challenges of human interaction and retrieval. Data practices are local, varying from field to field, individual to individual, and country to country. As the number and variety of research partners expands, so do the difficulties of sharing, reusing, and sustaining access to data. Information retrieval is hindered by the lack of agreement on what are "data." Complexities of human interaction with data will be illustrated with empirical examples from environmental sciences, sensor networks, astronomy, biomedicine, and other fields. Unless larger questions of knowledge infrastructures and stewardship are addressed by research communities, "no data" often becomes the norm. Implications for policy and practice in the information sciences will be explored, drawing upon the presenter's book, Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World (MIT Press, 2015), and subsequent research.},

abstract = {The ability to find information online using a search engine is a key modern literacy skill. However, information seeking remains particularly challenging for many people with disabilities, a sizable population comprising over a billion people worldwide, including approximately 20% of adults in the U.S. In this talk, I will describe how various types of disability impact information seeking, including sensory disabilities such as vision impairment and cognitive differences such as dyslexia. I will present research at the intersection of human-computer interaction and information retrieval that aims to address the challenges that search engine use presents for these populations. These examples illustrate how considering the needs of end-users with disabilities can result in the creation of accessible search tools that benefit us all.},

abstract = {In mobile crowd-sourcing systems, simply relying on people to opportunistically select and perform tasks typically leads to drawbacks such as low task acceptance/completion rates and undesirable spatial skews. In this paper, we utilize data from TASKer, a campus-based mobile crowd-sourcing platform, to empirically study and discover whether and how various context-aware notification strategies can help overcome such drawbacks. We first study worker interactions, in the absence of any notifications, to discover some spatio-temporal properties of task acceptance and completion. Based on these insights, we then experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of two novel, non-personal, context-driven notification strategies, comparing the outcomes to two different baselines (no-notification and random-notification). Finally, using the data from the random-notification mechanism, we derive a classification model, incorporating several novel contextual features, that can predict a worker's responsiveness to notifications with high accuracy. Our work extends the crowd-sourcing literature by emphasizing the power of smart notifications for greater worker engagement.},

We developed a simple predictive system to demonstrate the benefit of this method. It utilizes text-based querying and regular expression to suggest the most probable next numeric actions in the suggestion bar along with word suggestions. We evaluated this method in two user studies. The first explored number entry and the second explored editing. Results revealed that the proposed method significantly increases number entry and editing speed and accuracy. It reduces the number of actions needed per task. It also significantly reduces the time and effort needed to fix errors. Subjective analysis revealed that almost all participants found the method faster, more reliable, and easier to use than the conventional method, thus wanted to keep using it on their mobile devices.},

abstract = {Traditional search through collections of audio recordings compares a text-based query to text metadata associated with each audio file and does not address the actual content of the audio. Text descriptions do not describe all aspects of the audio content in detail. Query by vocal imitation (QBV) is a kind of query by example that lets users imitate the content of the audio they seek, providing an alternative search method to traditional text search. Prior work proposed several neural networks, such as TL-IMINET, for QBV, however, previous systems have not been deployed in an actual search engine nor evaluated by real users. We have developed a state-of-the-art QBV system (Vroom!) and a baseline query-by-text search engine (TextSearch). We deployed both systems in an experimental framework to perform user experiments with Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers. Results showed that Vroom! received significantly higher search satisfaction ratings than TextSearch did for sound categories that were difficult for subjects to describe by text. Results also showed a better overall ease-of-use rating for Vroom! than TextSearch on the sound library used in our experiments. These findings suggest that QBV, as a complimentary search approach to existing text-based search, can improve both search results and user experience.},

abstract = {With the improvements in speech recognition and voice generation technologies over the last years, a lot of companies have sought to develop conversation understanding systems that run on mobile phones or smart home devices through natural language interfaces. Conversational assistants, such as Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana, can help users to complete various types of tasks. This requires an accurate understanding of the user's information need as the conversation evolves into multiple turns. Finding relevant context in a conversation's history is challenging because of the complexity of natural language and the evolution of a user's information need. In this work, we present an extensive analysis of language, relevance, dependency of user utterances in a multi-turn information-seeking conversation. To this aim, we have annotated relevant utterances in the conversations released by the TREC CaST 2019 track. The annotation labels determine which of the previous utterances in a conversation can be used to improve the current one. Furthermore, we propose a neural utterance relevance model based on BERT fine-tuning, outperforming competitive baselines. We study and compare the performance of multiple retrieval models, utilizing different strategies to incorporate the user's context. The experimental results on both classification and retrieval tasks show that our proposed approach can effectively identify and incorporate the conversation context. We show that processing the current utterance using the predicted relevant utterance leads to a 38% relative improvement in terms of nDCG@20. Finally, to foster research in this area, we have released the dataset of the annotations.},

abstract = {The role of conversational assistants has become more prevalent in helping people increase their productivity. Document-centered assistance, for example to help an individual quickly review a document, has seen less significant progress, even though it has the potential to tremendously increase a user's productivity. This type of document-centered assistance is the focus of this paper. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We first present a survey to understand the space of document-centered assistance and the capabilities people expect in this scenario. (2) We investigate the types of queries that users will pose while seeking assistance with documents, and show that document-centered questions form the majority of these queries. (3) We present a set of initial machine learned models that show that (a) we can accurately detect document-centered questions, and (b) we can build reasonably accurate models for answering such questions. These positive results are encouraging, and suggest that even greater results may be attained with continued study of this interesting and novel problem space. Our findings have implications for the design of intelligent systems to support task completion via natural interactions with documents.},

abstract = {Millions of arguments are shared on the web. Future information systems will be able to exploit this valuable knowledge source and to retrieve arguments relevant and convincing to our specific need---all with an interface as intuitive as asking your friend "Why ...". Although recent advancements in argument mining, conversational search, and voice recognition have put such systems within reach, many questions remain open, especially on the interface side. In this regard the paper at hand presents the first study of argument search behavior. We conduct an online-survey and a focused user study, putting emphasis on what people expect argument search to be like, rather than on what current first-generation systems provide. Our participants expected to use voice-based argument search mostly at home, but also together with others. Moreover, they expect such search systems to provide rich information on retrieved arguments, such as the source, supporting evidence, and background knowledge on entities or events mentioned. In observed interactions with a simulated system we found that the participants adapted their search behavior to different types of tasks, and that up-front categorization of the retrieved arguments is perceived as helpful if this is short. Our findings are directly applicable to the design of argument search systems, not only voice-based ones.},

abstract = {Distractions while driving are a major cause of traffic accidents and chief among these is the use of mobile phones. Driver distractions typically fall into four categories-visual, cognitive, bio-mechanical, and auditory-and different technological solutions have been proposed to address these. Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs), such as Siri, is a recent example of such a technological solution that offers the potential for hands-free phone interaction through a voice-controlled interface. IPAs could potentially reduce visual and bio-mechanical distractions if they are usable enough to not increase a driver's cognitive load. We present the results of a controlled experiment with the aim of understanding how the use of Siri while driving compares to manual interaction in terms of usability and distractions. We also tested these two interaction types in the lab in order to understand how the main driving task influences Siri's (perceived) usability. Our study shows that Siri is not ready for every-day use in the car: interacting with Siri while driving is likely to be unsafe for most participants, especially less experienced drivers. Participants were distracted by Siri due to its over-reliance on visual feedback as well as frequent time-outs by Siri when waiting for a response from a driver occupied with the road environment. Speech recognition quality in a noisy car as well as problematic multi-lingual speech recognition in general are other issues that resulted in low usability and more cognitive distractions. While interacting with Siri may be hands-free, it does not provide an eyes-free and distraction-free experience yet.},

abstract = {To hold a true conversation, an intelligent agent should be able to occasionally take initiative and recommend the next natural conversation topic. This is a challenging task. A topic suggested by the agent should be relevant to the person, appropriate for the conversation context, and the agent should have something interesting to say about it. Thus, a scripted, or one-size-fits-all, popularity-based topic suggestion is doomed to fail. Instead, we explore different methods for a personalized, contextual topic suggestion for open-domain conversations. We formalize the Conversational Topic Suggestion problem (CTS) to more clearly identify the assumptions and requirements. We also explore three possible approaches to solve this problem: (1) model-based sequential topic suggestion to capture the conversation context (CTS-Seq), (2) Collaborative Filtering-based suggestion to capture previous successful conversations from similar users (CTS-CF), and (3) a hybrid approach combining both conversation context and collaborative filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, we use real conversations collected as part of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 Conversational AI challenge. The results are promising: the CTS-Seq model suggests topics with 23% higher accuracy than the baseline, and incorporating collaborative filtering signals into a hybrid CTS-Seq-CF model further improves recommendation accuracy by 12%. Together, our proposed models, experiments, and analysis significantly advance the study of open-domain conversational agents, and suggest promising directions for future improvements.},

In the field of IIR, little is known about this user-intermediary interaction. More empirical data is therefore needed, both to understand how to support the intermediaries and increase the possibilities for people with intellectual impairments to solve information needs themselves. In this study, 25 people working with adults with intellectual impairments were interviewed about the information needs of the end users and the routines for solving these needs. The purpose was to explore when and how the user-intermediary interaction occurred. According to this study, most end users had limited access to information sources, and relied almost entirely on intermediaries. Further, the technological skills among the intermediaries seemed to affect access to and use of digital devices. Few end users expressed information needs outside everyday life. Moreover, information needs were given very little attention and solving such needs were not part of the routines at most facilities.},

In this paper, we report the findings of our qualitative analysis of participants' diary entries and post-diary in-depth interviews. Specifically, we identified six types of information that were essential to design-related creative projects: procedural information, domain information, finished examples, tips/opinions/recommendations, information about specific topics, and inspiring/motivating information. For each type of information, we discuss participants' intents to use the information in their projects. We also describe challenges reported by our participants when they used search engines to address their information needs.

abstract = {Loss of privacy and encounters with misinformation are two challenges individuals are likely to encounter in their search for information on the web. These challenges have potential negative impacts, especially in search domains such as health search. Existing information retrieval (IR) systems offer users little (if any) guidance as to how to reduce the likelihood of such negative impacts. The sum of these problems provides motivation for experiments to identify elements of existing IR environments that might provide low-cost options to the user for improved search outcomes.An online user study (N = 90) was performed allowing users to visit search results for 10 medical search tasks adapted from previous research. Analysis was performed on all search results visited in the experiment, with a total of 523 unique web pages collectively visited, with additional analysis performed on a set of 10,000 popular websites. The analysis suggests that the best strategy for users with the goal of protecting their privacy and simultaneously finding more accurate information for their medical search tasks, is to visit websites with .org and .gov in the URL. There is some evidence that HTTP is a useful predictor as well. Existing literature is limited with respect to utilization of these features and thus the findings, along with the annotations, are a key contribution for future research, for which possible directions are provided.},

abstract = {This perspectives paper proposes a conceptualization of trust that does not require a predefined feature space, but rather is dynamically formed at the point of information interaction through a cognitive predicting mechanism. Trust is a significant issue in the current information context due to fake news, echo chambers, filter bubbles, and confirmation biases which can result in a disconnect between human trust expectations and information trustworthiness, making it difficult to establish a feature space within which trust might be modeled. In response to this, we present our Cognitive Predicting Theory of Trust (CPTT) which allows trust to be modeled without the requirement of a predefined feature space. Drawn from the cognitive theory of Predictive Processing, CPTT describes how people form trust judgments based on cognitive predictions within a system of information interactions. We outline how this CPTT view of trust might be modeled using complex systems and provide examples showing how curation of the information interaction environment can affect the trust associated with the system. We conclude by proposing that our perspective opens up two avenues for exploration in Computer Human Information Interaction and Retrieval: (1) the need for alternative models, and (2) the value of curating the information environment.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are commonly used in entertainment, news, e-commerce, and social media. Document recommendation is a new and under-explored application area, in which both re-finding and discovery of documents need to be supported. In this paper we provide an initial exploration of users' experience with recommended documents, with a focus on how prior interactions influence recognition and interest. Through a field study of more than 100 users, we investigate the effects of past interactions with recommended documents on users' recognition of, prior intent to open, and interest in the documents. We examined different presentations of interaction history, and the recency and richness of prior interaction. We found that presentation only influenced recognition time. Our findings also indicate that people are more likely to recognize documents they had accessed recently and to do so more quickly. Similarly, documents that people had interacted with more deeply were also more frequently and quickly recognized. However, people were more interested in older documents or those with which they had less involved interactions. This finding suggests that in addition to helping users quickly access documents they intend to re-find, document recommendation can add value in helping users discover other documents. Our results offer implications for designing document recommendation systems that help users fulfil different needs.},

The survey asked people to describe a recent task in which they searched across multiple sessions, to recall the reasons they started and stopped the most recent search session for the task, and to explain methods they used for reacquainting themselves with the task at the beginning of the most recent session. Across a broad range of tasks reported by our participants, our results show that a majority of the cross-session work tasks involved high levels of cognitive complexity, consultation with additional human information sources (in addition to search engines), and often involved multiple devices (e.g., computer and smartphone). Our analysis of reasons why people stopped and restarted search sessions extends and validates the reasons outlined in Lin and Belkin's model of Multiple Information Seeking Episodes and previous results from MacKay and Watters' study of multi-session search. We also identified methods that searchers use to re-acquaint themselves when restarting multi-session searches, and reasons why they may choose not to use any re-acquainting method. Our results update prior work and provide insights about how search systems can better support cross-session work tasks.},

The fear is that these technologies are undermining democracy by swaying opinion and creating an uninformed, polarised populace. The literature in this space is mostly techno-centric, addressing the impact of technology. In contrast, our work is the first research in the information interaction field to examine changing viewpoints from a human-centric perspective. It provides a new understanding of view change and how we might support informed, autonomous view change behaviour. We interviewed 18 participants about a self-identified change of view, and the information touchpoints they engaged with along the way. In this paper we present the information types and sources that informed changes of viewpoint, and the ways in which our participants interacted with that information. We describe our findings in the context of the techno-centric literature and suggest principles for designing digital information environments that support user autonomy and reflection in viewpoint formation.},

abstract = {Since the appearance of digital research infrastructures in the humanities in the last decade, important efforts are being made to understand and model scholarly processes. Different methods are used in those investigations, which often result in abstract representations of research phases, taxonomies of scholarly activities, in conceptual frameworks, or in scholarly ontologies. While the aim of these representations is to inform the design of the digital infrastructures, the complexity and diversity of scholarly work pose the question about the applicability of those models for design and evaluation of research infrastructures and tools. In this paper, we explore a methodology to analyze workflows from a micro-perspective, which aims at capturing the transitions between activities. We use two scholarly projects as case studies, describe their research activities in detail by using existing ontologies and describe the connections between activities, and analyse generic transitions. We discuss what kinds of implications this approach has to evaluation and design of information systems and services to facilitate scholars' complex and varied research processes.},

abstract = {Complex search tasks that involve uncertain solution space and multi-round search iterations are integral to everyday life and information-intensive workplace practices, affecting how people learn, work, and resolve problematic situations. However, current search systems still face plenty of challenges when applied in supporting users engaging in complex search tasks. To address this issue, we seek to explore the dynamic nature of complex search tasks from process-oriented perspective by identifying and predicting implicit task states. Specifically, based upon the Web search logs and user annotation data (regarding information seeking intentions in local search steps, in-situ search problems, and help needed) collected from 132 search sessions in two controlled lab studies, we developed two task state frameworks based on intention state and problem-help state respectively and examined the connection between task states and search behaviors. We report that (1) complex search tasks of different types can be deconstructed and disambiguated based on the associated nonlinear state transition patterns; and (2) the identified task states that cover multiple subtle factors of user cognition can be predicted from search behavioral signals using supervised learning algorithms. This study reveals the way in which complex search tasks are unfolded and manifested in users' search interactions and paves the way for developing state-aware adaptive search supports and system evaluation frameworks.},

abstract = {Digital assistants help people perform simple tasks, including scheduling, home automation, information look up, and question answering. Current assistants offer less support for accomplishing more complex tasks comprising multiple steps. These tasks sometimes require the ability to leverage the capabilities of multiple devices. Ideal smart assistants for such complex scenarios would track task progress and recommend useful and appropriate information at every step of the procedure. To this end, we introduce the novel notion of step-wise recommendation as a means of automatically providing guidance relevant to the current step in a complex task. We employ a common real-life scenario for this purpose: recipe preparation. We demonstrate how a smart assistant can be developed to offer support for complex tasks enabled by multi-modal inputs and outputs through multiple devices (i.e., smart speakers, tablets, or other smart devices available in kitchens). We develop step-wise recommendation models for this scenario and analyze their efficacy for: (1) different prediction tasks (e.g., resources, devices), and (2) different contextual information used to make the prediction (e.g., completed steps, current step, and importantly, future steps). Our recommendation model achieves a prediction accuracy of 83-96%, depending on the prediction task and context used. The findings have implications for the design of intelligent systems to help people accomplish complex tasks.},

abstract = {Evaluation metrics for search typically assume items are homoge- neous. However, in the context of web search, this assumption does not hold. Modern search engine result pages (SERPs) are composed of a variety of item types (e.g., news, web, entity, etc.), and their influence on browsing behavior is largely unknown.In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical analysis of pop- ular web search queries and investigate how different item types influence how people interact on SERPs. We then infer a user browsing model given people's interactions with SERP items - creating a data-driven metric based on item type. We show that the proposed metric leads to more accurate estimates of: (1) total gain, (2) total time spent, and (3) stopping depth - without requiring extensive parameter tuning or a priori relevance information. These results suggest that item heterogeneity should be accounted for when de- veloping metrics for SERPs. While many open questions remain concerning the applicability and generalizability of data-driven metrics, they do serve as a formal mechanism to link observed user behaviors directly to how performance is measured. From this approach, we can draw new insights regarding the relationship between behavior and performance - and design data-driven metrics based on real user behavior rather than using metrics reliant on some hypothesized model of user browsing behavior.},

We encode participants' eye-movement scanpaths as images, and then train a convolutional neural network classifier using these scanpath images. The trained classifier is used to predict participants' perceived-relevance of news articles from the corresponding scanpath images. This method is content-independent, as the classifier does not require knowledge of the screen-content, or the user's information-task. Even with little data, the image classifier can predict perceived-relevance with up to 80% accuracy. When compared to similar eye-tracking studies from the literature, this scanpath image classification method outperforms previously reported metrics by appreciable margins. We also attempt to interpret how the image classifier differentiates between scanpaths on relevant and irrelevant documents.},

With greater knowledge of PS, systems could be designed that accommodate users with low PS to improve their overall search experience. However, in this perspectives paper, we analyse how PS tests have been used in IR, and identify multiple uncertainties regarding PS content, administration, analysis, and reporting of findings. Consequently, we aim to stir discussion between IR researchers by drawing awareness to these issues. As a result, we further discuss challenges involved in advancing how future PS tests are used in IR. Finally, we propose recommendations that have the potential for enhancing the reliability and validity of current PS tests.},

The aim is to systematize the findings of these studies by categorizing the types of usefulness and their predictor types. Significant empirical associations between predictor types and usefulness are systematized, too. The data consists of articles in journals or conference proceedings focusing on the usefulness of search results either in web or database environment. The results indicate that there is a growing trend to complement topical relevance by the usefulness of search results in evaluating search systems. Search tasks typically instruct participants to search information for a writing task. Perceived usefulness of search results is the established measure in studies, although there are alternative measures in use. Significant associations between predictors and usefulness do not accumulate much but vary notably. Growth of knowledge on the usefulness of search results is based on the increasing number and variety of proposition supported empirically.},

abstract = {In online shopping quality is a key consideration when purchasing an item. Since customers cannot physically touch or try out an item before buying it, they must assess its quality from information gathered online. In a typical eCommerce setting, the customer is presented with seller-generated content from the product catalog, such as an image of the product, a textual description, and lists or comparisons of attributes. In addition to catalog attributes, customers often have access to customer-generated content such as reviews and product questions and answers. In a crowdsourced study, we asked crowd workers to compare product pairs from kitchen, electronics, home, beauty and office categories. In a side-by-side comparison, we asked them to choose the product that is higher quality, and further to identify the attributes that contributed to their judgment, where the attributes were both seller-generated and customer-generated. We find that customers tend to perceive more expensive items as higher quality but that their purchase decisions are uncorrelated with quality, suggesting that customers seek a trade-off between price and quality when making purchase decisions. Crowd workers placed a higher value on attributes derived from customer-generated content such as reviews than on catalog attributes. Among the catalog attributes, brand, item material and pack size were most often selected. Finally, attributes with a low correlation with perceived quality are nonetheless useful in predicting purchases in a machine-learned system.},

Prior research has focused on using translation to provide users with information written in other languages, yet there are still many languages with little or no such resources. In this paper, we propose the use of intercomprehension -- a form of communication in which speakers of two different languages communicate using their own languages, mainly due to similarities between the languages. Accordingly, we conducted a user study on six Sub-Saharan languages to explore: user interaction behaviour in a retrieval environment where intercomprehension is expected; to investigate the usefulness of search results that assume intelligibility and relevance; and investigate affective episodes associated with intercomprehension in retrieval through retrospection. Although intercomprehension may come with a cost to understand unfamiliar languages, our results show that user preference of ranking of search results in related languages incorporates intelligibility. Our findings also suggest that intercomprehension is useful in retrieval for related languages -- users are able to identify relevant documents as well as complete search tasks by applying intercomprehension. However, the negative emotions or frustration associated with intercomprehension suggest that this type of interaction should be used in extreme cases where there are no or very few relevant documents in the language of the query.},

abstract = {The majority of US Internet users have searched the internet for health-related information. When people conduct these health searches, searching for information about medical treatments is among the more common reasons. While being a convenient and fast method to collect information, when used by people for health search, search engines can be biased toward results saying treatments are helpful, regardless of the truth. The presence of incorrect information in search results may potentially cause harm, especially if people believe what they read without further research or professional medical advice. In this paper, we aim to better understand the decision making process of determining the efficacy of medical treatments using search result pages. We conducted a think-aloud study in order to gain insights on strategies people use during online search for health related topics. We found that, even when participants are careful and focused on the task, biased search engine results can significantly influence people to make decisions consistent with the bias. The chief reason biased search engines results were able to influence participants is that participants often considered what the majority of the search results stated as part of their decision-making. We also found that participants looked for indications of authoritativeness and quality when evaluating online content. While rank bias and a bias towards wanting treatments to be helpful has been found in prior studies, our participants did not reveal these biases as part of their spoken thoughts. Our results imply that more attention should be paid to search engines' biases given people's bias towards accepting the most common answer in the results as the correct answer. When search results are biased toward incorrect results for health-related searches, dire consequences may be the result.},

abstract = {Health literacy affects how people understand health information and, therefore, should be considered by search engines in health searches. In this work, we analyze how the level of health literacy is related to the eye movements of users searching the web for health information. We performed a user study with 30 participants that were asked to search online in the context of three work task situations defined by the authors. Their eye interactions with the Search Results Page and the Result Pages were logged using an eye-tracker and later analyzed. When searching online for health information, people with adequate health literacy spend more time and have more fixations on Search Result Pages. In this type of page, they also pay more attention to the results' hyperlink and snippet and click in more results too. In Result Pages, adequate health literacy users spend more time analyzing textual content than people with lower health literacy. We found statistical differences in terms of clicks, fixations, and time spent that could be used as a starting point for further research. That we know of, this is the first work to use an eye-tracker to explore how users with different health literacy search online for health-related information. As traditional instruments are too intrusive to be used by search engines, an automatic prediction of health literacy would be very useful for this type of system.},

abstract = {While computers causing chaos is a common social trope, nearly the entirety of the history of computing is dedicated to generating order. Typical interactive information retrieval tasks ask computers to support the traversal and exploration of large, complex information spaces. The implicit assumption is that they are to support users in simplifying the complexity (i.e. in creating order from chaos). But for some types of task, particularly those that involve the creative application or synthesis of knowledge or the creation of new knowledge, this assumption may be incorrect. It is increasingly evident that perfect order-and the systems we create with it-support highly-structured information tasks well, but provide poor support for less-structured tasks. We need digital information environments that help create a little more chaos from order to spark creative thinking and knowledge creation. This paper argues for the need for information systems that offer what we term 'bounded chaos', and offers research directions that may support the creation of such interfaces},

We target context-of-use intents, such as the activity for which a product is used and the target audience for a product, which are subjective and not usually indexed as product attributes in the catalog. We describe a method to predict latent query intents: we extract intents from product reviews on amazon.com and, using behavioral purchase signals that associate queries with the reviewed products, train query classifiers that label queries with the intents extracted from reviews. For example, we predict the activity "running" for the query "adidas mens pants." We show that our method can predict latent intents not indexed directly in the product catalog.},

These updates can either be sent to users' mobile devices as push notifications or be silently deposited in an inbox to be consumed - the important difference is whether the user is interrupted by the delivery. Previously, a two-year study examining user attention under these different mechanisms revealed interesting findings about users' information consumption behavior, but the conclusions were marred by a few methodological shortcomings. We present a reproducibility study that follows the same design as the original evaluation, but corrects its flaws. We find that most conclusions from the original study are confirmed, although there are some surprising differences as well. Overall, the magnitude of the observed effects are not as strong as in the original study.},

abstract = {An important question in interactive information retrieval (IIR) is: How do task characteristics influence users' needs? In this paper, we investigate the effects of cognitive task complexity on the types of information considered useful for a task. We characterize information types from two perspectives. From one perspective, we classify task-related information items based on inherent characteristics (referred to as info-types): factual statements, concepts/definitions, opinionated statements, and insights---tips/advice related to the task domain. From a second perspective, we used Bystr\"{o} m and J"a rvelin's framework~citebystrom1995 to define information types based on how the information might be used to complete the task (referred to as functional roles): (1) to help the task doer understand the task requirements (problem information); (2) to help the task doer strategize on how to approach the task (problem-solving information); and (3) to help the task doer learn about the task domain (domain information). Our results suggest that: (1) cognitive task complexity influences the functional roles of information items deemed useful for the task (RQ1); (2) certain info-types are more (or less) likely to play certain functional roles (RQ2); and task complexity influences the variety of functional roles played by info-types (RQ3).},

Based on primary and secondary sources, we developed a dataset of IPA-directed personality utterances and analyzed IPA responses to such utterances from four major IPAs-Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana-using Fiske's stereotype content model. The model supports classification of user perceptions of other people or objects on warmth and competence dimensions. The findings suggest that while all four IPAs were frequently perceived as competent, Alexa and Siri were more frequently perceived as low-warmth compared to the higher-warmth Google Assistant and Cortana. Future work aims to verify the initial classification of IPA personality responses using warmth-competence dimensions, and test user demographic and situational preferences for personality manifestations in IPA responses.},

abstract = {While searching for two-dimensional content has become common practice in our work and leisure activities, search and retrieval of three-dimensional assets has thus far been underrepresented in research and practice. Therefore, it is unclear how to exactly support complex searches for these types of content. To contribute to fill this gap, this paper focuses on the role of context in Search User Interfaces (SUIs) for 3D objects and shows how it is envisioned by digital humanists in an exploratory user study. An evaluation of interactive mockups of a prospective search engine, contextualized by 2D, enhanced 2D and 3D maps, shows the scholars' preference for three-dimensional map views. A further qualitative analysis also suggests the need for more hybrid ways to visualize spatial context of 3D objects. This includes object properties, object relationships and spatial cues. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of SUI support for accessing the growing number of reality-based 3D models and virtual reconstructions.},

abstract = {An important question in interactive information retrieval (IIR) is: How can we support searchers with specific types of search tasks? We describe an auxiliary support tool referred to as the "Matrix''. The Matrix tool was designed to support searchers with comparative search tasks, which require comparing items along different dimensions. The Matrix was designed as a grid of rows and columns representing the items and dimensions related to a comparative task. The Matrix was integrated with a custom-built search interface, which allowed users to search for information and drag-and-drop relevant passages directly into cells in the Matrix. We investigate the following general question: Given a partially completed Matrix, can a system automatically populate empty cells in the Matrix with relevant passages? To this end, we conducted two crowdsourced studies in which participants were assigned comparative tasks and asked to use our system (integrated search interface + Matrix) to populate every cell in the Matrix. After gathering this data, we evaluated machine-learned models for ranking passages in response to an empty Matrix cell and partially completed Matrix. We address two research questions: (RQ1) What are useful types of features for this predictive task? and (RQ2) How does performance vary based on the level of Matrix completion? We view our research as a step towards designing support tools that: (1) help users organize information while searching and (2) can autocomplete search tasks by exploiting the task structure and a searcher's partial solution.},

This paper reports findings from retrospective think-aloud (RTA) observations with 13 undergraduates with dyslexia, focusing on the memory-related barriers they face and the workarounds they use to overcome these barriers. An enhanced understanding of the full range of barriers faced by information-seekers with dyslexia can inform the design of dyslexia-aware digital information environments and information literacy programs. These can 'level the information playing field' by helping to break down barriers to information and, in turn, to knowledge creation.},

We find that these interfaces yield annotations of high quality and separation of tasks. We find no significant improvements in quality between UIs.

During the web search, the time participants spent on different information resources was measured, differentiating between text-dominated websites and videos. Furthermore, to examine the role of learners' cognitive abilities, their working memory capacity (WMC) and reading comprehension ability (RCA) were assessed. Results of a hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that after controlling for prior knowledge, WMC and RCA positively predicted students' learning outcome, as measured by the number of correct concepts included in essays composed after search. Moreover, the time spent on text-dominated websites was also associated with better learning outcomes. In contrast, the time spent watching videos was not beneficial. To conclude, our findings provide preliminary evidence that the time leaners spend on text-dominated websites and on videos might not contribute equally to the acquisition of conceptual knowledge in SAL tasks.},

abstract = {YouTube is one of the leading social media platforms and online spaces for people who self-harm to search and view deliberate self-harm videos, share their experience and seek help via comments. These comments may contain information that signals a commentator could be at risk of potential harm. Due to a large amount of responses generated from these videos, it is very challenging for social media teams to respond to a vulnerable commentator who is at risk. We considered this issue as a multi-class problem and triaged viewers' comments into one of four severity levels. Using current state-of-the-art classifiers, we propose a model enriched with psycho-linguistic and sentiment features that can detect critical comments in need of urgent support. On average, our model achieved up to 60% precision, recall, and f1-score which indicates the effectiveness of the model.},

abstract = {Online videos are a medium of choice for young adults to access or receive information, and recent work has highlighted that it is a particularly effective medium for adults with intellectual disability, by its visual nature. Reflecting on a case study presenting fieldwork observations of how adults with intellectual disability engage with videos on the Youtube platform, we propose a framework to define and evaluate the accessibility of such large video repositories, from an informational perspective. The proposed framework nuances the concept of information accessibility from that of the accessibility of information access interfaces themselves (generally catered for under web accessibility guidelines), or that of the documents (generally covered in general accessibility guidelines). It also includes a notion of search (or browsing) accessibility, which reflects the ability to reach the document containing the information. In the context of large information repositories, this concept goes beyond how the documents are organized into how automated processes (browsing or searching) can support users. In addition to the framework we also detail specifics of document accessibility for videos. The framework suggests a multi-dimensional approach to information accessibility evaluation which includes both cognitive and sensory aspects. This framework can serve as a basis for practitioners when designing video information repositories accessible to people with intellectual disability, and extends on the information presentation guidelines such as suggested by the WCAG.},

abstract = {Offline evaluations of recommender systems attempt to estimate users' satisfaction with recommendations using static data from prior user interactions. These evaluations provide researchers and developers with first approximations of the likely performance of a new system and help weed out bad ideas before presenting them to users. However, offline evaluation cannot accurately assess novel, relevant recommendations, because the most novel items were previously unknown to the user, so they are missing from the historical data and cannot be judged as relevant. We present a simulation study to estimate the error that such missing data causes in commonly-used evaluation metrics in order to assess its prevalence and impact. We find that missing data in the rating or observation process causes the evaluation protocol to systematically mis-estimate metric values, and in some cases erroneously determine that a popularity-based recommender outperforms even a perfect personalized recommender. Substantial breakthroughs in recommendation quality, therefore, will be difficult to assess with existing offline techniques.},

abstract = {As voice-based assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant become ubiquitous, users increasingly expect to maintain natural and informative conversations with such systems. However, for an open-domain conversational system to be coherent and engaging, it must be able to maintain the user's interest for extended periods, without sounding "boring" or "annoying". In this paper, we investigate one natural approach to this problem of modulating response prosody, i.e., changing the pitch and cadence of the response to indicate delight, sadness or other common emotions, as well as using pre-recorded interjections. Intuitively, this approach should improve the naturalness of the conversation, but attempts to quantify the effects of prosodic modulation on user satisfaction and engagement remain challenging. To accomplish this, we report results obtained from a large-scale empirical study that measures the effects of prosodic modulation on user behavior and engagement across multiple conversation domains, both immediately aftereach turn, and at the overall conversation level. Our results indicate that the prosody modulation significantly increases both immediate and overall user satisfaction. However, since the effects vary across different domains, we verify that prosody modulations do not substitute for coherent, informative content of the responses. Together, our results provide useful tools and insights for improving the naturalness of responses in conversational systems.},

In this work, we analyze the role of word-eye-fixations for predicting query terms. We investigate the relationship between a range of in-session features, in particular, gaze data, with the query terms and train models for predicting query terms. We use a dataset of 50 search sessions obtained through a lab study in the social sciences domain. Using established machine learning models, we can predict query terms with comparably high accuracy, even with only little training data. Feature analysis shows that the categories Fixation, Query Relevance and Session Topic contain the most effective features for our task.},

In this paper, we address personalization of book search, as an exemplary case of entity search, by exploiting sparse user profiles obtained through online questionnaires.

In order to answer this question, we here present the results of a user study ($N=64$) in which searchers were tasked with learning about a topic by searching the web for 20 minutes; they were prompted at regular intervals during the search session on their knowledge about the topic. We find that for study participants with little to no prior knowledge the learning gains are sublinear, while participants with some prior knowledge have the largest knowledge gains towards the end of the search session.},

One of the most valuable sources of such information is the News. However, in order for the user to hear the news that is useful and relevant to them, it must be recommended in an interesting and informative way. However, to the best of our knowledge, em how to present a news item for a voice-based recommendation remains an open question. In this paper, we empirically compare different ways of recommending news, or specific news items, in a voice-based conversational setting. Specifically, we study the user engagement and satisfaction with five different variants of presenting news recommendations: (1) a generic news briefing; (2) news about a specific entity relevant to the current conversation; (3) news about an entity from a past conversation; (4) news on a trending news topic; and (5) the default - a suggestion to talk about news in general. Our results show that entity-based news recommendations exhibit 29% higher acceptance compared to briefing recommendations, and almost 100% higher acceptance compared to recommending generic or trending news. Our investigation into the presentation of news recommendations and the resulting insights could make voice assistants more informative and engaging.},

In this paper, we aim to address this need by providing a comprehensive Android app, called Omicron, which can be used to collect mobile query logs and perform user studies on mobile devices. Omicron, at its current version, can collect users' mobile queries, relevant documents, sensor data as well as user activity and interaction data in various study settings. Furthermore, we designed Omicron in such a way that it is conveniently extendable to conduct more specific studies and collect other types of sensor data. Finally, we provide a tool to monitor the participants and their data both during and after the collection process.},

abstract = {Research in the field of information retrieval and recommendation mostly focuses on one single evaluation method and one single quality objective. On the one hand, many research endeavors focus on system-centric evaluation from an algorithmic perspective and consider the context of use only to a minor extent. On the other hand, there are research endeavors focusing on user-centric approaches to the design and evaluation of systems. However, algorithmic quality and perceived quality of user experience do not necessarily match. Thus, it is essential for system evaluation to substantially integrate multiple evaluation methods that cover a variety of relevant aspects and perspectives. Only such an integrated combination of methods may lead to a deep understanding of users, their behavior, and experience in their interaction with a system. This half-day tutorial follows the objective to raise awareness in the CHIIR community concerning the significance of using multiple methods in the evaluation of information retrieval and recommender systems. The tutorial illustrates the "blind spots'' when using single methods. It introduces the concept of "multi-method evaluation'' and discusses its benefits and challenges. While multi-method evaluations may be designed very flexibly, the tutorial presents broadly-defined basic options of how multiple methods may be integrated in an evaluation design. In group work, participants are encouraged to select and fine-tune a specific design that best matches their research endeavor's purpose.},

It verges on impossible with artificial environments and tightly constrained tasks such as those found in usability labs. Similarly, artificial measures of user satisfaction that are readily available from test collections are unlikely to provoke revolutionary insights. The alternative is to study user behaviour in the wild, however this involves complex trade-offs between method, precision, privacy, interpretation and generalizability. This tutorial addresses both qualitative and quantitative methods, and how to balance the risks of studying unpredictable but fully human behaviour.},

abstract = {The Third WEPIR 2020 workshop builds on the success of the first two WEPIR meetings held at CHIIR 2018 and CHIIR 2019. WEPIR 2020 again brings together researchers from different backgrounds interested in continuing to explore and advance the evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval. Similar to the first two workshops, WEPIR 2020 has a strong emphasis on active participation by workshop attendees. This was very successfully achieved in the first two workshops by the use of workshop breakout groups exploring topics related to personalisation and information retrieval, and the evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval in general, with subsequent report back to the workshop as a whole. However, a key difference for WEPIR 2020 is that while the first two workshops focused on developing and articulating principles and ideas relating general topics relating to these topics, identified as interesting and important by the attendees at the workshops, WEPIR 2020 focuses breakout discussion on a number of relevant specific use cases of the evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval. A use case is assigned to each breakout group with the plan being to have more than one group work on each use case. The task for each group is to identify specific relevant factors relating to the use case in terms of user activities, data to be collected, ethical issues, and evaluation metrics. Groups will make reports of their discussions to the assembled workshop in the final session with discussion of the alternative solutions relating to the same use case, and contrasting the issues raised by the different use cases. The overall goal of the workshop is to work towards developing a general set of principles and guidelines for addressing the evaluation of specific instances of the use of personalisation in information retrieval tasks. This is consistent with the activities and goals of the first two workshops, but represents a significant progression of the activities towards concrete outcomes of benefit to those exploring personalisation in search, the issues arising in its evaluation, and how researchers might go about tackling this in specific situations.},

abstract = {Many workplace learning solutions rely on formal online approaches in delivery (e.g., video lecture) and assessments (e.g., quizzes). However, learning theory has moved toward learner-centred approaches that emphasize individual learning concepts, like self-efficacy and metacognition, in order to develop a person's ability to learn independently. Using an embedded mixed-method design, both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to understand self-efficacy and engagement in metacognition in a self-determined learning context. A quantitative survey will collect information on engagement, self-efficacy, and perceived knowledge. A qualitative diary study will capture metacognitive strategies and learning reflections which will conclude with semi-structured interviews and arts-based elicitation that will describe opportunities and barriers in a search-based self-determined learning process. This proposed research aims to contribute to a personal learner-centred design framework that supports positive learning behaviours in an increasingly digital world.},

While WM plays a critical role in complex cognitive tasks, little is known about how it manifests in users' search-sensemaking while they are working with information in a complex information space such as the Web. A mixed-method design will be adopted, consisting of an experimental study and interviews. Adults with different levels of working memory capacity (WMC) will perform a learning assignment task in a lab. The combined data of screen activities and think-aloud comments will be analyzed to investigate the differential patterns in search-sensemaking between high- and low-WMC individuals (RQ1). An evolving working document will be considered an external representation of their knowledge structure and be analyzed to investigate the differential patterns in conceptual changes between high- and low-WMC individuals (RQ2). Finally, a post-session interview will be conducted to identify a range of cognitive strategies used during the task (RQ3). The proposed study will build upon the cognitive process model of sensemaking and the literature on executive functions and WM. The study will help us better understand the cognitive process of search-sensemaking from the perspective of WM. The findings can also inform design decisions for systems that can facilitate search-sensemaking while supporting users with varying levels of WMC.},

abstract = {When a search result does not satisfy a user's needs, the user often abandons their query and submits a reformulated query in the hopes of receiving better search results. The action of abandoning search results is termed query abandonment, and previous research has indicated possible reasons for this action, such as dissatisfaction with the result or coming up with a better query. Query abandonment can be seen as a negative or positive signal. As we move closer to understanding when and what causes a user to abandon their query under different qualities of search results, we move forward in the development of an overall understanding of user behaviour with search engines. This can be helpful for developing more accurate evaluation measures and better methods of collecting relevance judgments. In this work project, we plan to study how the quality of both queries and search results can affect the rate and time users abandon their queries. Specifically, we discuss experiments to investigate the rate at which users abandon their query at different levels of search quality, and whether user examination is affected by the type of non-relevant results. User behaviour in our studies will be analyzed with a combination of eye-tracking and questionnaires. The use of eye-tracking will accurately measure user attention to different elements in the search engine results page (SERP) and how far in the search results a user examines before abandoning the query. Questionnaires will provide insights from users' perspectives into the form and quality of submitted queries.},

abstract = {Cross-session search is ubiquitous in people's daily life and work. People search for a variety of information across multiple sessions to complete a task or solve a problem. Given the challenging characteristics of cross-session search, there are many studies on developing tools to support cross-session search. However, there has been less attention to investigate reasons that cause people to stop and resume searches across sessions for the same task, which is an extremely important aspect of understanding cross-session search. Motivated by research on task factors and users' information behavior, we focus on how and why people search across sessions. Particularly, we propose to 1) identify reasons that cause cross-session searches in everyday life; 2) characterize search stopping and renewal reasons and their relationships during cross-session search; 3) investigate the influence of task factors and user characteristics on stopping and renewal reasons, and to further identify their influences on users' information behavior. Our results will shed light on searchers' cross-session search behavior characteristics and help inform the design of systems to provide better assistance for cross-session search tasks.},
