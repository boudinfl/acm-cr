abstract = { Our understanding of search processes triggered by complex tasks are limited [1]. It is not well known how does the information search process evolve during task performance and how search behavior varies by task process. How do changes in in information needs reflect in search formulation and tactics, in selecting contributing sources and interacting with sources for task outcome? A better understanding of these issues helps in identifying success criteria for various parts of search process. The results contribute also to designing support tools for complex search tasks.  In the talk I analyze information search processes in complex tasks. By task I mean larger tasks, which lead people to engage in search tasks for finding information to advance those tasks [2]. Search process consists of activities from query formulation to working with sources selected for task outcome [3]. I approach task performance from cognitive point of view conceptualizing it as changes in cognitive structures [4,5]. These structures consist of concepts and their relations representing some phenomenon. I analyze how changes in knowledge structures are associated to query formulation and search tactics, selecting contributing sources and working with sources for creating a task outcome. As a result I suggest hypotheses concerning associations between changes in knowledge structures and search behaviors. I present also some ideas for success indicators at various stages of search process.},

abstract = {Web search is frequently used by people to acquire new knowledge and to satisfy learning-related objectives, but little is known about how a user»s knowledge evolves through the course of a search session. We present a study addressing the knowledge gain of users in informational search sessions. Using crowdsourcing, we recruited 500 distinct users and orchestrated real-world search sessions spanning 10 different topics and information needs. By using scientifically formulated knowledge tests we calibrated the knowledge of users before and after their search sessions, quantifying their knowledge gain. We investigated the impact of information needs on the search behavior and knowledge gain of users, revealing a significant effect of information need on user queries and navigational patterns, but no direct effect on the knowledge gain. Users on average exhibited a higher knowledge gain through search sessions pertaining to topics they were less familiar with.  Our findings in this paper contribute important ground work towards advancing current research in understanding user knowledge gain through web search sessions.},

Query priming employs query auto-completion (QAC) and query suggestion (QS) to present search terms that stimulate critical thinking and encourages careful information seeking and decision making. We conducted an online user study using a crowdsourcing service. Analysis of search behavior logs and questionnaire responses confirmed the following. (1) With query priming, participants issued more queries and (re-)visited search engine result pages more frequently. (2) Query priming promoted webpage selection targeted at evidence-based decision making. (3) The query priming effect varied relative to participant educational background. This study contributes to search interaction design to enhance user engagement in critical thinking in web searches.},

We present the participants with four search tasks, each of them designed to represent different cognitive levels of learning. Through quantitative analysis of the participants» Web search logs, we examine how individual search behavior is influenced by different task complexity levels as we present the tasks in a hierarchical order. We also explore how the perceived learning outcomes and processes, and the different learning actions, are related to the levels of cognitive complexity. By analyzing the search logs, self-reports, interview data, and the reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively, we infer that searching and learning are not isolated but co-existing processes. Distinct search patterns and learning outcomes were observed in tasks of different cognitive complexities, and overlapping learning actions were observed for the different tasks.},

However, prior work has not systematically analyzed how important style is in task-oriented, information-seeking exchanges of the sort we might have with a conversational search agent. We examine recordings from the MISC data set, where pairs of "users" and "intermediaries" collaborate on information-seeking tasks, and look for indications of style which can be computed at scale. We find that stylistic markers identified by Tannen in casual chat do exist in information-seeking dialogue, and that participants can be arranged along a single stylistic dimension: "considerate" to "involved". This labelling for style needs no manual intervention. Furthermore, we find that there is no clear best style; but that differences in style, previously thought to impede communication, are only a problem for shorter tasks. This result is likely due to alignment of conversational style over the course of an interaction.},

We present a Wizard of Oz study on the use of  searchbots  (i.e., chatbots that perform specific types of searches) during collaborative information-seeking tasks. Specifically, we study searchbots that  intervene dynamically  and compare between two intervention types: (1) the searchbot presents questions to users to gather the information it needs to produce results, and (2) the searchbot monitors the conversation among the collaborators, infers the necessary information, and then displays search results with no additional input from the users. We investigate three research questions: (RQ1) What is the effect of a searchbot (and its intervention type) on participants» collaborative experience' (RQ2) What is the effect of a searchbot»s intervention type on participants» perceptions about the searchbot and level of engagement with the searchbot' and (RQ3) What are participants» impressions of a dynamic searchbot? Our results suggest that dynamic searchbots can enhance users» collaborative experience and that the intervention type does not greatly affect users» perceptions and level of engagement. Participants» impressions of the searchbot suggest unique opportunities and challenges for future work.},

abstract = {People often have difficulty in expressing their information needs. Many times this results from a lack of clarity about the task at hand, or the way an information or search system works. In addition, people may not know what they do not know. The former is addressed by search systems by providing recommendations, whereas there are no good solutions for the latter problem. Even when a search system makes recommendations, they are limited to suggesting objects such as queries and documents only. They do not consider providing suggestions for strategies, people, or processes. This Perspective Paper addresses it by showing how to investigate the nature of the work a person is doing, predicting the potential problems they may encounter, and providing help to overcome those problems. This help could be an object such as a document or a query, a strategy, or a person. This whole process is referred to as Information Fostering. Beyond crafting a general-purpose recommender system, Information Fostering is the idea of providing proactive suggestions and help to information seekers. This could allow them avoid potential problems and capture promising opportunities from a search process before it is too late. The current paper presents this new perspective by outlining desired characteristics of an Information Fostering system, envisioning application scenarios, and proposing a set of potential methods for moving forward. Beyond these details, the primary purpose of this paper is to offer a new viewpoint that looks at the other side of the information seeking coin, by bringing together ideas from human-computer interaction, information retrieval, recommender systems, and education.},

abstract = {When users are looking for information on the Web, they show different behavior for different task types, e.g., for fact finding vs. information gathering tasks. For example, related work in this area has investigated how this behavior can be measured and applied to distinguish between easy and difficult tasks. In this work, we look at the searcher's behavior in the domain of journalism for four different task types, and additionally, for two different topics in each task type. Search behavior is measured with a number of session variables and correlated to subjective measures such as task difficulty, task success and the usefulness of documents. We acknowledge prior results in this area that task difficulty is correlated to user effort and that easy and difficult tasks are distinguishable by session variables. However, in this work, we emphasize the role of the task topic - in and of itself - over parameters such as the search results and read content pages, dwell times, session variables and subjective measures such as task difficulty or task success. With this knowledge researchers should give more attention to the task topic as an important influence factor for user behavior.},

abstract = {Popular search engines are usually tuned to satisfy the information needs of a general audience. As a result, non-traditional, yet active groups of users, such as children, experience challenges composing queries that can lead them to the retrieval of adequate results. To aid young users in formulating keyword queries that can facilitate their information-seeking process, we introduce ReQuIK, a multi-perspective query suggestion system for children. ReQuIK informs its suggestion process by applying (i) a strategy based on search intent to capture the purpose of a query, (ii) a ranking strategy based on a wide and deep neural network that considers both raw text and traits commonly associated with kid-related queries, (iii) a filtering strategy based on the readability levels of documents potentially retrieved by a query to favor suggestions that trigger the retrieval of documents matching children»s reading skills, and (iv) a content-similarity strategy to ensure diversity among suggestions. For assessing the quality of the system, we conducted initial offline and online experiments based on 591 queries written by 97 children, ages 6 to 13. The results of this assessment verified the correctness of ReQuIK»s recommendation strategy, the fact that it provides suggestions that appeal to children and ReQuIK»s ability to recommend queries that lead to the retrieval of materials with readability levels that correlate with children»s reading skills.},

abstract = {Many large digital collections are organized by sorting their items into topics and arranging these topics hierarchically, such as those displayed in a tree view. The resulting information organization structures mitigate some of the challenges of searching digital information realms; however, the topic hierarchies are often large and complex, and thus difficult to navigate. Automated techniques have been shown to produce significantly smaller, simplified versions of existing topic hierarchies while preserving access to the majority of the collection, but these simplified topic hierarchies have never been tested with human participants, and so it is not clear what effect simplification would have on the exploration and use of such structures for browsing and retrieval. This study partly addresses this gap by performing a comparative test with three groups of university students (N=62) performing ten topic hierarchy exploration tasks using one of three versions of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) hierarchy: 1) the original LCSH hierarchy, acting as a baseline, 2) a shallower version of 1), and 3) a narrower version of 2). A quantitative analysis of measures of accuracy, time, and browsing shows that participants using the simplified trees were significantly more accurate and faster than those using the unmodified tree, and the narrower, balanced tree was also faster than the shallower tree. These results show that automated topic hierarchy simplification can facilitate the use of such hierarchies, which has implications for the development of information organization theory and human-information interaction techniques for similar information structures.},

We coded the verbal data into classes of informativeness and confusion and correlated it with fixations and durations on the Areas of Interests recorded by the eye-tracking device. We used various analysis techniques, including Mann-Whitney, regression, and Levenshtein distance, to investigate how confused users differed from non-confused users, what information of the personas caused confusion, and what were the predictors of confusion of end users of personas. We consolidate our various findings into a confusion ratio measure, which highlights in a succinct manner the most confusing elements of the personas. Findings show that inconsistencies among the informational elements of the persona generate the most confusion, especially with the elements of images and social media quotes. The research has implications for the design of personas and related information products, such as user profiling and customer segmentation.},

abstract = {Email continues to be one of the most important means of online communication, leading to a number of challenges related to information overload and email management. To better understand email management practices in detail, we examine the distribution of visits to emails over time. During their lifetime, emails may be visited one or more times, and with each visit different actions may be taken. Emails that are revisited over time are especially interesting because they represent an opportunity to improve email management and search. In this paper, we present a large-scale log analysis of email revisitation, the activities that people perform on revisited email messages (e.g. responding to, organizing or deleting messages, and opening attachments), and the strategies they use to go back to these emails. We find that most emails have a short lifetime, with more than 33% having a lifetime of less than 5 minutes. We also find that deleting is the most common action taken on messages visited once, and that responding and organizing are more common for messages visited more than once. We complement the log analysis with a survey to understand the motivation behind revisits and the types of emails that are revisited. The survey results show that 73% of the visits are to find information (e.g. a link or document, instructions to perform a task, or answers to questions), while 20% of revisits are to respond to the email. Our findings have implications for designing email clients and intelligent agents that support both short- and long-term revisitation patterns.},

Despite being designed for real-time and ephemeral content, recent studies have shown that re-finding of older content is performed in Social Media applications too. To better understand why this is and how re-finding can be better supported, in this work we describe the results of a large-scale web-based survey which queried 606 Twitter users on how and how often they re-find, as well as the motivations for this behaviour. Our main contribution is the qualitative analysis of these motivations and motivations sourced via two existing studies, resulting in a coding scheme documenting the breadth and frequency of different Social Media re-finding tasks. We discuss how this classification can be used in (i) the design of task-based evaluations, (ii) the detection and interpretation of re-finding in click-stream data and (iii) the design of Social Media search systems.},

The few existing studies have typically used interview or survey methods to focus on personal information management (PIM) practices on smartphones. We present the results of an exploratory contextual inquiry study of PIM practices aimed at providing a structured, naturalistic overview of PIM on both smartphones and tablets. We find that people use multiple complementary strategies to acquire different types of information on their devices, and that people rely strongly on automatic chronological ordering instead of organization by subject, although this pays off most for smaller information collections. Deletion of information is strongly influenced by usefulness and personal attachment. Finally, we find that people strongly prefer browsing over search when retrieving information from their devices.},

abstract = {Memory augmentation is the process of providing human memory with information that facilitates and complements the recall of an event in a person»s past. Recently, there has been a lot of attention on processing the content of meetings for later reuse, such as reviewing a meeting for supporting failing memories, keeping in mind key issues, verification, etc. That is due to the fact that meetings are essential for sharing knowledge in organizations. In this paper, we propose four novel time-series methods for predicting the topics that one should review in preparation for a next meeting. The predicted/recommended topics can be reviewed by a user as a memory augmentation process to facilitate recall of key points of a previous meeting. With the growing number of meetings at an organization that one may attend weekly and with the growing number of topics discussed, forgetting past meetings becomes eminent, hence recommending certain topics to the user in order to prepare the user for a future meeting is beneficial and important. Our experimental results on real-world data, demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform a state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model baseline. This indicates the efficacy of our proposed methods for modeling semantics in temporal data.},

abstract = {Complex software applications expose hundreds of commands to users through intricate menu hierarchies. One of the most popular productivity software suites, Microsoft Office, has recently developed functionality that allows users to issue free-form text queries to a search system to quickly find commands they want to execute, retrieve help documentation or access web results in a unified interface. In this paper, we analyze millions of search sessions originating from within Microsoft Office applications, collected over one month of activity, in an effort to characterize search behavior in productivity software. Our research brings together previous efforts in analyzing command usage in large-scale applications and efforts in understanding search behavior in environments other than the web. Our findings show that users engage primarily in command search, and that re-accessing commands through search is a frequent behavior. Our work represents the first large-scale analysis of search over command spaces and is an important first step in understanding how search systems integrated with productivity software can be successfully developed.},

abstract = {The success of information retrieval systems depends critically on both the ability of systems to efficiently and effectively retrieve information, and to support people in articulating their information needs and making sense of the results. This interdisciplinary, user-centered perspective on information systems motivated my early work on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which sought to mitigate the disagreement between the vocabulary that authors use in writing and searchers use to express their information needs, and continues to shape my research today. Over the last two decades, search has become a core fabric of people's everyday lives, driven by advances in understanding context, natural language, and speech. I will illustrate how new capabilities in email and virtual assistants are driven by advances in both algorithms and user modeling. As we look forward to new types of information systems that anticipate information needs, interact via richer dialogs, and integrate physical and digital information, it is more important than ever to understand and support information seekers using interdisciplinary methods and perspectives.},

abstract = {Today, the widespread use of mobile devices allows users to search information "on the go»», whenever and wherever they want, no longer confining Information Retrieval to classic desktop interfaces. We believe that technical advances in Augmented Reality will allow Information Retrieval to go even further, making use of both the users» surroundings and their abilities to interact with the physical world. In this paper, we present the fundamental concept of Reality-Based Information Retrieval, which combines the classic Information Retrieval process with Augmented Reality technologies to provide context-dependent search cues and situated visualizations of the query and the results. With information needs often stemming from real-world experiences, this novel combination has the potential to better support both Just-in-time Information Retrieval and serendipity. Based on extensive literature research, we propose a conceptual framework for Reality-Based Information Retrieval. We illustrate and discuss this framework and present two prototypical implementations, which we tested in small user studies. They demonstrate the feasibility of our concepts and inspired our discussion of notable challenges for further research in this novel and promising area.},

In many cases, users immediately requery without clicking on any search results. In this paper, we report on a user study designed to investigate the rate at which users immediately reformulate at different levels of search quality. We had users search for answers to questions as we manipulated the placement of the only relevant document in a ranked list of search results. We show that as the quality of search results decreases, the probability of immediately requerying increases. We find that users can quickly decide to immediately reformulate, and the time to immediately reformulate appears to be independent of the quality of the search results. Finally, we show that there appears to be two types of users. One group has a high probability of immediately reformulating and the other is unlikely to immediately reformulate unless no relevant documents can be found in the search results. While requerying takes time, it is the group of users who are more likely to immediately requery that are able to able find answers to questions the fastest.},

Towards this goal, we explore document representations for retrieval that include features associated with effective learning outcomes. While prior studies have investigated different retrieval models designed for teaching, this study is the first to investigate how document-level features are associated with actual learning outcomes when users get results from a personalized learning-oriented retrieval algorithm. We also conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first crowdsourced longitudinal study of long-term learning retention, in which we gave a subset of users who participated in an initial learning and assessment study a delayed post-test approximately nine months later. With this data, we were able to analyze how the three retrieval conditions in the original study were associated with changes in long-term vocabulary knowledge. We found that while users who read the documents in the personalized retrieval condition had immediate learning gains comparable to the other two conditions, they had better long-term retention of more difficult vocabulary.},

abstract = {The availability of information in many languages on the Web allows multilingual searchers to search in multiple languages at the same time. Few studies have examined how multilingual web users seek information in two or more languages online, specifically how they switch languages in order to get satisfying search results. This research investigates native Chinese web users» code-switching (Chinese-English) search behaviors in their information seeking process through diary studies interviews. Results indicate that they usually switch languages when they need translation, search for domain knowledge, news and entertainment information, and academic resources, go online shopping, seek personal health information, and need social networking. Findings highlight when the participants need prompt information, they search in Chinese in order to get an immediate understanding. They seek information in English for better resources, which can offer them appropriate information and help them search effectively. We also find that these multilingual users use situational code-switching when the search tasks require them to switch languages in order to get effective and sufficient search results. The role of each language is different in the situational code-switching. When web users switch languages due to emotional or attitude changes associated with complex social or cultural context, they use metaphorical code-switching in order to get satisfying search results. The study aims to provide implications for website design concerning multilingual web users' code-switching search strategies, habits, and needs.},

abstract = {While the number of polyglot Web users across the globe has increased dramatically, little human-centered research has been conducted to better understand and support multilingual user abilities and preferences. In particular, in the fields of cross-language and multilingual search, the majority of research has focused primarily on improving retrieval and translation accuracy, while paying comparably less attention to multilingual user interaction aspects. By contrast, this paper specifically focuses on multilingual search user interface preferences and behaviors, through a lab-based user study involving 25 participants interacting with a set of four different interactive multilingual search user interfaces. User preference results confirm that multilingual search users generally have strong preferences towards interfaces that provide clear language separation, and that the traditional approach of interleaving results, as typically used in prior research, is least preferred. In addition, an analysis of user interaction behaviors shows that multilingual users make significant use of each of their languages, and that there are several interaction behavior differences depending on interface and task type.},

To address this problem, we conducted an online evaluation of 30 dialog jokes from different sources by almost 300 participants -- volunteers and Mechanical Turk workers. We collected joke ratings along with participants» age, gender, and language proficiency. Results show that demographics and joke topics can partly explain variation in humor judgments. We expect that these insights will aid humor evaluation and interpretation. The findings can also be of interest for humor generation methods in conversational systems.},

An early theme about government websites and information emerged in the data analysis and that is the topic of this paper. For all three tasks, participants prioritized and valued information from U.S. government websites over that of commercial websites, which seems to contradict recent national surveys indicating low levels of trust in government information sources and the government in general.

abstract = {Learning-related type of tasks has attracted much research attention recently but it is still not clear what factors would influence users learning outcomes and how. In this study, we conducted a user experiment to assess searchers learning outcomes and examine how information source selection strategies would influence their learning outcomes. In this experiment, thirty-two college students conducted search for two types of learning tasks: receptive tasks and critical tasks. Participants were asked to write down what they knew about the task before and after the search. For data analysis, we proposed a comprehensive assessment method, which used both quantitative measures (i.e. knowledge points, knowledge facets, knowledge scope, etc.) and qualitative measures to assess users' learning outcomes. Our results demonstrated that searchers' information source preferences influence their learning outcomes; i.e., encyclopedia-preferred sessions had better relevance of written summaries in receptive tasks and Q&amp;A preferred sessions led to better relevance in critical tasks. Furthermore, searchers had two types of information source selection strategies: task-adaptive strategy and non-task-adaptive strategy. The results showed that searchers with task-adaptive strategy could gain better learning outcomes, e.g. knowledge points, facets, scope, depth, relevance and analyticity. This study highlighted the importance of information source selection strategies in learning-related type of tasks, and knowing how to select suitable information sources for different types of tasks may benefit the learning outcome for searchers.},

This study aims to fill this gap by researching the relationships between time constraints, search behaviors, and usefulness judgments. A controlled lab experiment was conducted with 40 participants searching for four tasks of two types (fact finding and information understanding), under two time conditions (with or without time constraints). Results show that time constraints and usefulness had interaction effects on first dwell time; while usefulness had positive relationship with total dwell time. Results indicate that knowing time constraints helps predict document usefulness from dwell time. The findings provide implications on personalization in information search.},

We conducted a study of Amazon Alexa usage and explored the manifestations and possible correlates of users' personification of Alexa. The data were collected via diary instrument from nineteen Alexa users over four days. Less than half of the participants reported personification behaviors. Most of the personification reports can be characterized as mindless politeness (saying 'thank you' and 'please' to Alexa). Two participants expressed deeper personification by confessing their love and reprimanding Alexa. A new study is underway to understand whether expressions of personifications are caused by users' emotional attachments or skepticism about technology's intelligence.},

But given the flexibility provided by the social media platforms, it is important to ensure that the right kind of information is delivered to the right audience when needed. The pilot study presented in this paper considered a sample of Zika related tweets that were classified into different prevention techniques. The classification categories were drawn from the guidelines by CDC. Training a logistic regression model on the annotated data we found the accuracy to be 72%. The findings are significant in studying the effectiveness of social media platforms in spreading the right kind of information in time. This in turn can be useful in informing health care officials to take necessary steps with the help of real-time communication for such unfortunate events in future.},

To address this problem, we introduce a two-stage examination model that can separately capture the position bias with a skimming model and the attractiveness bias with an attractiveness model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by using a dataset that contains explicit examination feedbacks from users. We further investigate user»s examination behaviors by analyzing the model parameters learned via EM algorithm. The results reveal some interesting findings such as how the skimming behavior is dependent on the previous examination sequence and what factors are associated with the attractiveness of search results on mobile SERPs.},

The search process is interactive and typically requires entering one or more queries, and assessing both summaries from Search Engine Result Pages and the underlying documents, to ultimately satisfy some information need. Under the Search Economic Theory model of interactive information retrieval, differences in query costs will result in search behavior changes. We investigate how differences in query inputs themselves may relate to Search Economic Theory by conducting a lab-based experiment to observe how text entries influence subsequent search interactions. Our results indicate that for faster typing speeds, more queries are entered in a session, while both query lengths and assessment times are lower.},

However, at most times users consider factors such as ease, time taken to complete the task, and the number of sources to be consulted as the essential factors while fulfilling the information seeking task. In our study, we explore the role of different cost variables -- ease, time taken to complete the task, and the number of sources consulted -- as the factors to be explored based on different cognitive task complexity levels, from Bloom»s taxonomy, by conducting a user study. We study the different search behaviors shown by users in online and offline environments based on the different cognitive task complexity levels and the three cost variables. We observed intriguing results that show factors such as ease, time, and the number of sources play a role in source selection while completing the tasks. Our study is a novel proposition in that we explore research in the direction of source selection based on different cognitive task complexity levels. The findings will contribute to shaping how tasks should be designed to use sources in a helpful and convenient manner. Moreover, the results also advance our understanding of the role that different affordances play in online and offline search behavior.},

However, the main focus of CNER is to obtain user feedback for constructing a profile for a class of entities on the fly and use that to retrieve entities from free text. Given a sentence, and an entity selected from that sentence, CNER aims to retrieve sentences that have entities similar to query entity. This paper explores obtaining term relevance feedback and importance weighting from humans in order to improve a CNER system.

abstract = {Relevance judgments are essential for designing information retrieval systems. Traditionally, judgments have been gathered via desktop interfaces. However, with the rise in popularity of smaller devices for information access, it has become imperative to investigate whether desktop based judgments are different from mobile judgments. Recently, user effort and document usefulness have also emerged as important dimensions to optimize and evaluate information retrieval systems. Since existing work is limited to desktops, it remains to be seen how these judgments are affected by user»s search device. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by collecting and analyzing relevance, usefulness and effort judgments on mobiles and desktops. Analysis of these judgments shows high agreement rate between desktop and mobile judges for relevance, followed by usefulness and findability. We also found that desktop judges are likely to spend more time and examine non-relevant/not-useful/difficult documents in greater depth compared to mobile judges. Based on our findings, we suggest that relevance judgments should be gathered via desktops and effort judgments should be collected on each device independently.},

abstract = {A patient»s health literacy has a direct impact on their health, but more than a third of the USA population has "basic" or "below basic" levels of health literacy. An individual»s wellbeing is also affected by the communication with their physician, as the use of technical terminology may hinder the patient»s understanding. A patient»s ability to, later on, recall or retrieve helpful information could reduce these comprehension problems and this can be improved by a good management of personal health information. To help overcome some of these problems, we created HealthTalks, a mobile app that empowers the patients, easing their daily health tasks and self-care ability. It does so by recording the audio of a medical appointment, transcribing its dialogue, giving more information about medical concepts employed, and allowing information associated with medical appointments to be easily managed by the patient. Usability tests were conducted with elderly people, ranging from the icons used to the general user experience. Results were very positive, with users accomplishing most tasks successfully and often with the least amount of clicks. We also evaluated the speech recognition software used, Google Cloud Speech API, reaching an error rate of 12 percent in medical texts.},

While evidence of the wonderful contributions arising from serendipitous events abound, the framework describing the information behaviors exhibited during a serendipitous experience is just emerging and additional detail regarding the factors influencing those behaviors is needed in order to support these experiences effectively. Furthermore, it is important to understand the whole process of serendipity to fully appreciate the impact of research policies, disciplinary traditions and academic reporting practices on this unique type of information behavior. This study addresses those need by examining the phenomenon of serendipity as it is reported by biomedical and radiography researchers. A mixed method content analysis of existing research reports will be incorporated with semi-structured interviews of serendipity reporters to gain a robust understanding of the phenomenon of serendipity, and provide detail that may inform the design of information environments.},

abstract = {Log analysis is an unobtrusive technique used to better understand search behavior and evaluate search systems. However, in contrast with open web search, in a vertical search system such as a digital library or media archive the collection is known and central to its purpose. This drives different, more collection-oriented questions when studying the logs. For example, whether users need different support in different parts of the collection. In a digital library, the collection is categorized using professionally curated metadata. We conjecture that using this metadata can improve and extend the methods and techniques for log analysis. We investigate how to identify different types of search behavior using the metadata explicitly, how to explain and predict user interactions for the different types of behavior found, and finally how to communicate our research results to domain experts.},

Little is known about how the two groups interact online around works of fiction, using either specialist social reading platforms e.g. GoodReads or Wattpad, or popular social media tools like Twitter. A better understanding of the interplay between them and the role technology plays as mediator can help inform the development of next-generation tools to suit their needs. We describe findings from interviews conducted with genre fiction authors and readers about how and why they interact and share information online. Interviews revealed that the social dynamics between the groups are complex, and that intercommunication can be both limited and somewhat unwanted. This shifted our focus from identifying how they interact to understanding why they do not. We found that communication patterns established by the traditional publishing industry create barriers between the groups, made visible, and exacerbated, by their retrofit to online social platforms where readers and authors are treated as equal. We discuss our key findings and highlight opportunities to better support the incongruent information needs of the groups.},

However, despite its general availability, the use of voice interaction remains sporadic and is limited to basic search tasks such as checking weather updates and looking up answers to factual queries. Present-day voice search systems struggle to use relevant contextual information to maintain conversational state, and lack conversational initiative needed to clarify user's intent, which hampers their usability and prevents users from engaging in more complex interaction activities. This research investigates the potential of a hypothesised interactive information retrieval system with human-like conversational abilities. To this end, we propose a series of usability studies that involve a working prototype of a conversational system that uses real time speech synthesis. The proposed experiments seek to provide empirical evidence that enabling a voice search system with human-like conversational abilities can lead to increased likelihood of its adoption.},

It may be possible to evaluate information trustworthiness by examining the behavior of individuals in belief space rather than evaluating the information itself, which is a harder problem. To explore this, I propose to research a model for information retrieval that integrates two levels of information interaction. On the individual level, I leverage Munson and Resnick»s diversity-seeker, confirmer, and avoider patterns. At a group level, I integrate individual behaviors according to Moskivici»s work on crowd polarization. These perspectives have been integrated in a simulation that employs insights from animal collective behavior to model agent groups, which enable the systematic exploration of belief navigation behaviors that can be detected algorithmically. Viewing information retrieval from the perspective of belief spaces may shed light on current practices and lay out consideration for future design work.},

Two preliminary user studies with real-life tasks were conducted to compare the visual interface to a standard ranked list interface. The users» subjective evaluations show significant improvement in many metrics. I further show that the users explored a diverse set of recommended items while experiencing an increase in overall user satisfaction.

abstract = {The goal of this workshop is to serve as a starting point for a community-driven effort to design and implement a platform for the collection, organization, maintenance, and sharing of resources for IIR experimentation. As in all scientific endeavors, progress in IIR research is contingent on the ability to build on previous ideas, approaches, and resources. However, we believe there to be a number of barriers to reproducibility and re-use of resources in IIR research: the fragmentary nature of how the community»s resources are organized, the lack of awareness of their existence, documentation and organization of the resources, the nature of the typical research publication cycle, and the effort required to make such resources available. We believe that an online platform dedicated to the collection and organization of IIR resources could be a promising way of overcoming these barriers. The workshop therefore aims to serve both as a brainstorming opportunity about the shape this iRepository should take, as well as a way of building support in the community for its implementation.},

abstract = {The purpose of the WEPIR 2018 workshop is to bring together researchers from different backgrounds, interested in advancing the evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval. The workshop focus is on the development of a common understanding of the challenges, requirements and practical limitations of meaningful evaluation of personalisation in information retrieval. The planned outcome of the workshop is the proposal of methodologies to support evaluation of personalised information retrieval from both the perspectives of the user experience in interactive search settings, and of user models for personalised information retrieval and their algorithmic incorporation in the search process.},
