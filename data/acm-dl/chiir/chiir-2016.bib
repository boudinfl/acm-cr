abstract = {Over the last 25-30 years, an enormous amount has been learned about how people seek, use, maintain, and reuse information and expertise in groups and other collectivities. We have also seen major changes in the kinds of information available and in how it is available.I believe we're on the cusp of the next generation of computational environments and user experiences. It goes under many names - pervasive environments, Internet of Things, Big Data, ubicomp, and on and on - but what is clear is that things are about to change for information - and for users.This talk considers some of the changes that might occur, grounding them in current work - then and tries to find the new roles and characteristics that search and information seeking will have. (Spoiler Alert: search and seeking will more tightly intertwine.).},

abstract = {Models of information seeking, including Kuhlthau's Information Search Process model, describe fundamentally different macro-level stages. Current search systems usually do not provide support for these stages, but provide a static set of features predominantly focused on supporting micro-level search interactions. This paper investigates the utility of search user interface (SUI) features at different macro-level stages of complex tasks. A user study was designed, using simulated work tasks, to explicitly place users within different stages of a complex task: pre-focus, focus, and post-focus. Active use, passive use and perceived usefulness of features were analysed in order to derive when search features are most useful. Our results identify significant differences in the utility of SUI features between each stage. Specifically, we have observed that informational features are naturally useful in every stage, while input and control features decline in usefulness after the pre-focus stage, and personalisable features become more useful after the pre-focus stage. From these findings, we conclude that features less commonly found in web search interfaces can provide value for users, without cluttering simple searches, when provided at the right times.},

abstract = {With the growing amount of content stored in personal and organizational information spaces, finding and re-finding documents becomes both more crucial and challenging. In this work, we propose an approach to reduce information overload in navigation by automatically focusing on important documents, adaptively to the tasks at hand. Based on the idea of managed forgetting, we present a ranking method, which unifies activity logs and semantic information about documents into a common framework to identify important documents to the user's current tasks. Our experiments on two real-world datasets, both collected from knowledge work activities in professional scenarios, show that our ranking approach outperforms the baseline methods for both subsequent access prediction and the effectiveness in ranking important documents. Furthermore, we implemented and demonstrated a system for decluttering information spaces as a proof of concept of our managed forgetting approach.},

abstract = {When people perform some tasks on their desktop, they tend to spend a considerable amount of time looking back, establishing past references and remembering. A task contains an evolving collection of documents to which the user is referring and that are relevant to the task. In the case of Web documents people tend to rely on their organisational skills and use a variety of "keeping" and "re-finding" tools which traditionally include bookmarks, history and search, amongst others. This paper reports the results of surveys conducted to investigate the way that people keep and re-find Web based tasks. As tasks can be interrupted or conducted over different sessions a user needs to keep, re-find, and resume them. A prototype called PiMxT is also presented, which uses an incremental density-based clustering approach to automatically generate and keep task-clusters by considering the user's window and tab switching, and re-visitation behaviour. The algorithm attempts to identify those documents that pertain to the same task-cluster, and also when a switch between two documents is effectively a task-switch. PiMxT allows for searching and filtering across the task-clusters as well as task-resumption through different visualisations. This tool was evaluated through a usability study and a questionnaire, and it was found that the time taken by the 15 participants to re-find and resume tasks was on average 44% less in 77% of the cases. Furthermore, although the participants expected PiMxT to be more complete and accurate they all recognised its usefulness.},

abstract = {Recent research shows that Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR), in which two or more users collaborate on the same search task, has become increasingly popular. The presence of both search and collaboration behaviors makes CIR a complex search format, which further drives a critical need to understand CIR's search context. The contextual support for CIR should consider search contexts derived from both team members' search histories (including users' own search histories and partners' search histories) and their explicit collaboration (e.g., chatting). As it stands, existing studies on contextual search support only focus on Individual Information Retrieval (IIR) and only utilize individuals' own search histories. In this paper, we examine the unique search contexts (e.g., partners' search histories and team collaboration histories) in CIR. Based on a user study data collection with 54 participants, we find that compared to the use of individuals' own search histories, CIR contextual support is more effective when utilizing partners' search histories and teams' collaboration behaviors. More interestingly, though the explicit communication information (i.e., chat content) often involves massive noisy information, involving such noise does not affect the ranking of relevant documents since it also does not appear in relevant documents.},

abstract = {Collaborative information seeking frequently occurs in an opportunistic and loosely-coupled fashion that is supported by awareness of others' activities on the web. Automatically sharing traces of information about web activity could substantially improve these collaborative information tasks, but conventional wisdom suggests that people are very reluctant to share information about web usage. Because work settings have different rules and practices about privacy, we carried out the first systematic study of people's privacy concerns about sharing web activity within workgroups. To provide a better understanding of privacy concerns about sharing web activity at work, we conducted a two-week diary study with 18 participants. Our study system asked participants to report on their search tasks and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, our results showed that people have little concern about sharing the majority of their activities with their work colleagues, and had even fewer concerns with sharing work-related activities. Our results provide new insights into the possibilities of sharing web activities within workgroups, and provide evidence that tools based on automatic sharing of awareness information can be feasible.},

abstract = {When searching for evidence in civil litigation, parties to a lawsuit have the right to withhold some content on grounds of specific privileges that serve to foster socially desirable outcomes such as open communication between attorneys and their clients. As inadvertent disclosure of privileged content can adversely impact a client's interests, review for privilege is a high-stakes process that is most often performed manually. Because the circumstances in which privilege can be claimed are generally well defined, review for privilege is amenable to some degree of automation. This paper describes the design of an interactive system to support privilege review in which the goals are to improve the speed and accuracy of privilege review. Results are reported for a within-subjects study in which six reviewers with different levels of expertise examined email for attorney-client privilege or any other valid basis for withholding the content from release. Quantitative results indicate that substantial and statistically significant improvements in recall can be achieved, but no significant differences in average review speed were detected. Participants self-reported that the identity features exposed by the system were most useful to them, and that the present implementation of features based on content or date added no discernible additional value.},

This experimental user study examines the relationship between user engagement (UE) and comprehension in varied academic reading environments. Forty-one university students interacted with one of two sets of texts presented in 4 conditions in the context of preparing for a class assignment. Employing the User Engagement Scale (UES), we found evidence of a relationship between students' comprehension of the texts and their degree of engagement with them. However, this association was confined to one of the UES subscales and was not consistent across levels of engagement. An examination of additional variables found little evidence that system and content characteristics influenced engagement; however, we noted that all students' reported increased knowledge, but topical interest for non-engaged students declined. Results contribute to existing literature by adding further evidence that the relationship between engagement and comprehension is complex and mediated.},

Three supplementary dimensions spring from the observation that experiences apparently have become especially valuable phenomena in Western societies. The 10 dimensions are tried out in a field study at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Germany with the purpose to study their applicability in the evaluation of interactive sound archives. 29 walk-alongs were carried out with 58 museums visitors. Our analysis showed that it was possible to identify the 10 experience dimensions in the study material. Some dimensions were expressed more frequently than others. The distribution of expressed dimensions and the content of the user comments provided a clear picture of how the two sound archives differed in respect to the experiential qualities.},

abstract = {This paper performs an analysis on the influence of different factors on users' choices of specific word changes in query reformulation during a search session. We study three types of word changes: whether to remove or retain a word in the current query; whether or not to add a brand-new word to the query; whether or not to reuse a word (included in previous queries, but removed in the current query). Three types of factors are examined: session-level factors measuring task and user characteristics; query-level factors related to past user activities in a session; word-level factors for the characteristics of the examined word and its relation to the current query and search results. Statistical analysis suggests that: word-level factors strongly influence all three types of word changes; query-level factors only show a clear influence on retaining or removing a word; task-level factors exhibit limited direct influence on all three types of word changes. Analysis also disclose reasons for different word changes: users remove a word to stop exploring a subtask, or to correct bad performing queries; they look for related, unused words from recently viewed result summaries and add to queries; reusing a word usually indicates reverting from a subtask to the main task or another subtask.},

They introduce a significant change in information access, not only by introducing voice control and touch gestures but also by enabling dialogues where the context is preserved. This raises the need for evaluation of their effectiveness in assisting users with their tasks. However, in order to understand which type of user interactions reflect different degrees of user satisfaction we need explicit judgements. In this paper, we describe a user study that was designed to measure user satisfaction over a range of typical scenarios of use: controlling a device, web search, and structured search dialogue. Using this data, we study how user satisfaction varied with different usage scenarios and what signals can be used for modeling satisfaction in the different scenarios. We find that the notion of satisfaction varies across different scenarios, and show that, in some scenarios (e.g. making a phone call), task completion is very important while for others (e.g. planning a night out), the amount of effort spent is key. We also study how the nature and complexity of the task at hand affects user satisfaction, and find that preserving the conversation context is essential and that overall task-level satisfaction cannot be reduced to query-level satisfaction alone. Finally, we shed light on the relative effectiveness and usefulness of voice-controlled intelligent agents, explaining their increasing popularity and uptake relative to the traditional query-response interaction.},

abstract = {In addition to merging results of different types (e.g.~images, videos, news items) into a ranked list of Web documents, modern search engines have also started displaying entity cards (ECs) on the results page. Entity cards are intended to enhance search experience in several ways: (i) they help searchers navigate diversified results, (ii) provide a summary of relevant content directly on the results page and (iii) support exploratory search by highlighting relevant entities associated with a given user query. We conducted a large-scale crowd-sourced user study, with more than $700$ unique searchers, to investigate the effects of entity cards on search behaviour and perceived workload. We find that the presence of ECs has a strong effect on both the way users interact with search results and their perceived task workload. Furthermore, by manipulating EC properties content, coherence and vertical diversity), we uncover different effects and interactions between card properties on measures of search behaviour and workload. Our study contributes an in-depth analysis of the effects of entity cards on user interaction with modern Web search interfaces.},

abstract = {During information search, people often experience time pressure. This might be a result of a deadline, the system's performance or some other event. In this paper, we report results of a study with forty-five participants which investigated how time constraints and system delays impacted the user experience during information search. We randomly assigned half of our study participants to a treatment condition where they were only allowed five minutes per search task (the other half were given no time limits). For half of participants' search tasks, five second delays were introduced after queries were submitted and SERP results were clicked. We used multilevel modeling to evaluate a number of hypotheses about the effects of time constraint, system delays and user experience. We found those in the time constraint condition reported significantly greater time pressure, experienced higher task difficulty, less satisfaction with their performance, increased importance of working fast and engaged in more metacognitive monitoring. We found when experiencing system delays participants reported slower system speeds when encountering delays on the second task. This work opens a new line of inquiry into how time pressure impacts the search experience and how tools and interfaces might be designed to support people who are searching under time pressure. It also presents an example of how multilevel modeling can be used to better understand and model the complex interactions that occur during interactive information retrieval.},

abstract = {This presentation addresses methodological issues of interactive information retrieval (IIR) evaluation in terms of what it entails to study users' use and interaction with IR systems, as well as their satisfaction with retrieved information. In particular, the presentation focuses on test design, and it takes a look into the toolbox of IIR test design with reference to data collection methods and test procedure. It calls for careful and well-planned studies to qualify the knowledgebase generated as a result of the conducted IIR studies. The presentation further reflects on the need for an updated theoretical framework to describe partly the various types of IIR, and partly how IIR nowadays often is carried out in a seamless task switching IT environment on various platforms, including via apps. This type of environment furthermore calls for new methodologies to study the IIR behaviour in the habitat of the users to ensure a complete and realistic picture to enhance our understanding of IIR.The presentation also reflects on whether a re-thinking of the concept on an information need is necessary. One may ask whether it still makes sense to talk about types of information needs. Or should we rather study IIR from the perspective of search dedication and task load in order to also include everyday life information seeking?With this presentation, the IIR community is invited to an exchange of ideas and is encouraged to engage in collaborations with the solving of these (and other) issues to our joint advantage.},

abstract = {In Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) different services such as search term suggestion can support users in their search process. The applicability and performance of such services is either measured with different user-centered studies (like usability tests or laboratory experiments) or, in the context of IR, with their contribution to measures like precision and recall. However, each evaluation methodology has its certain disadvantages. For example, user-centered experiments are often costly and small-scaled; IR experiments rely on relevance assessments and measure only relevance of documents. In this work we operationalize the usefulness model of Cole et al. (2009) on the level of system support to measure not only the local effect of an IR service, but the impact it has on the whole search process. We therefore use a log-based evaluation approach which models user interactions within sessions with positive signals and apply it for the case of a search term suggestion service. We found that the usage of the service significantly often implicates the occurrence of positive signals during the following session steps.},

abstract = {Users make frequent use of Web search for learning-related tasks, but little is known about how different Web search interaction strategies affect outcomes for learning-oriented tasks, or what implicit or explicit indicators could reliably be used to assess search-related learning on the Web. We describe a lab-based user study in which we investigated potential indicators of learning in web searching, effective query strategies for learning, and the relationship between search behavior and learning outcomes. Using questionnaires, analysis of written responses to knowledge prompts, and search log data, we found that searchers' perceived learning outcomes closely matched their actual learning outcomes; that the amount searchers wrote in post-search questionnaire responses was highly correlated with their cognitive learning scores; and that the time searchers spent per document while searching was also highly and consistently correlated with higher-level cognitive learning scores. We also found that of the three query interaction conditions we applied, an intrinsically diverse presentation of results was associated with the highest percentage of users achieving combined factual and conceptual knowledge gains. Our study provides deeper insight into which aspects of search interaction are most effective for supporting superior learning outcomes, and the difficult problem of how learning may be assessed effectively during Web search.},

In this paper we present a user study that examines in detail the differences between primary and secondary assessors on a set of "real-world" topics which were gathered specifically for the work. By gathering topics which are representative of the staff and students at a major university, at a particular point in time, we aim to explore differences between primary and secondary relevance judgements for real-life search tasks. Findings suggest that while secondary assessors may find the assessment task challenging in various ways (they generally possess less interest and knowledge in secondary topics and take longer to assess documents), agreement between primary and secondary assessors is high.},

abstract = {Longitudinal corpora like newspaper archives are of immense value to historical research, and time as an important factor for historians strongly influences their search behaviour in these archives. While searching for articles published over time, a key preference is to retrieve documents which cover the important aspects from important points in time which is different from standard search behavior. To support this search strategy, we introduce the notion of a Historical Query Intent to explicitly model a historian's search task and define an aspect-time diversification problem over news archives.We present a novel algorithm, HistDiv, that explicitly models the aspects and important time windows based on a historian's information seeking behavior. By incorporating temporal priors based on publication times and temporal expressions, we diversify both on the aspect and temporal dimensions. We test our methods by constructing a test collection based on The New York Times Collection with a workload of 30 queries of historical intent assessed manually. We find that HistDiv outperforms all competitors in subtopic recall with a slight loss in precision. We also present results of a qualitative user study to determine wether this drop in precision is detrimental to user experience. Our results show that users still preferred HistDiv's ranking.},

abstract = {Many writers of non-fictional texts engage intensively in exploratory web search scenarios during their background research on the essay topic. Though understanding such search behavior is necessary for the development of search engines that specifically support writing tasks, it has neither been systematically recorded nor analyzed. This paper contributes part of the missing research: We report on the outcomes of a large-scale corpus construction initiative to acquire detailed interaction logs of writers who were given a writing task on 150 pre-defined TREC topics. The corpus is freely available to foster research on exploratory search. Each essay is at least 5000 words long and comes with a chronological log of search queries, result clicks, web browsing trails, and fine-grained writing revisions that reflect the task completion status. To ensure reproducibility, a fully-fledged, static web search environment has been created on top of the ClueWeb09 corpus as part of our initiative.In this paper, we present initial analyses of the recorded search interaction logs and overview insights gained from them: (1) essay writing behavior corresponds to search patterns that are rather stable for the same writer, (2) fact-checking queries often conclude a writing task, (3) recurring anchor queries are often submitted to not lose the main themes or to explore new directions, (4) query terms can be learned while searching and reading, (5) the number of submitted queries is not a good indicator for task completion.},

The main contributing factors for the lack of mainstream adoption can be attributed to the perception that Topic Modeling produces topics of poor quality and that content analysts do not trust the derived topics because they are unable to supply domain knowledge and interact with the algorithm. In this paper, interactive Topic Modeling algorithms namely Dirichlet-Forrest Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Penalised Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, are evaluated with respect to their ability to aid qualitative content analysis. More specifically, the relationship between interactivity, interpretation, topic coherence and trust in interactive content analysis is examined. The findings indicate that providing content analysts with the ability to interact with Topic Modeling algorithms produces topics that are directly related to their research questions. However, a number of improvements to these algorithms were also identified which have the potential to influence future algorithm development to better meet the requirements of qualitative content analysts.},

Platforms like Wikipedia act as information conduits through which informational elements (e.g. topic pages) cater to the information seeking needs of users worldwide. While usage data from these informational elements help us to predict the information seeking behavior of users, especially in reaction to external news events, what has been largely ignored in past literature is the predictive value of the underlying informational network that connects these elements. In this study, we uncover causal linkages in information seeking behavior among related informational elements on Wikipedia. We demonstrate that incorporating this causal information leads to better predictions of page view counts of relevant Wikipedia pages, when compared to models that ignore such underlying causal linkages. We also provide additional evidence about the efficacy of our approach from the real world, by performing a judgment study with human annotators. This research is among the first to investigate and uncover the value of understanding the underlying relationships among informational elements.},

abstract = {The collection of relevance judgements by assessors is important for many information retrieval (IR) tasks. In addition to the construction of test collections, relevance judging is critical to e-discovery and other applications where many assessors are hired to perform relevance judging. It is well known that assessors may differ in their judgements for a given document. One possible cause of a judgement difference is that an assessor may be uncertain in their judgement and thus may in effect be guessing the document's relevance. If assessors are aware of their uncertainty and can self-report their level of certainty, then uncertain relevance judgements can be targeted for adjudication by additional assessors. In this paper, we conducted a user study with 48 participants to test our hypothesis that assessors will be uncertain about their relevance judgements when the assessors are likely to disagree with each other. We found that for low consensus documents, i.e. documents known for assessor disagreement, assessors judge these documents with almost as much certainty as high consensus documents. In particular, assessor self-reported uncertainty is predictive of disagreement only for high consensus documents and not for low consensus documents.},

abstract = {While search expertise has long been considered an important variable in the study of online information search, the creation of a robust measure to characterize it has eluded researchers. Instead, those wishing to measure search expertise often include a single item that asks people to indicate how often they search or for how long they have been searching. In this paper, we report initial results of a four-phase study aimed at developing a measure of search expertise. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with nine professional searchers and an inventory of items related to online search expertise was created. While participants identified a number of usual items for determining search expertise, such as prior search experience, domain knowledge and resource knowledge, they also identified a large number of items related to personality characteristics such as persistence, flexibility, curiosity, adaptability and humility. These results suggest that measuring personality characteristics in addition to experience and knowledge might help determine who will be a more successful searcher. In today's search environments, where many people describe themselves as experts, representing these types of characteristics in a measure of search expertise might allow researchers and practitioners to observe more variation in populations of interest, design more effective instruction and make better predictions about search outcomes.},

abstract = {Participants in information search studies are often asked to characterize their search expertise using questionnaires provided by researchers. These questionnaires often contain ad hoc sets of items in part because there are no valid and reliable measures of search experience. In this paper, we present results of an exploratory factor analysis of 327 responses to a 14-item Search Self-Efficacy scale (SSE) that we have been using as a way to measure search experience in our research. The responses come from eight different interactive information retrieval (IIR) studies, which we have conducted over the last six years, with a variety of participant types: university students, participants from the general adult population and crowd-sourced participants. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the variation in search self-efficacy scores across different types of people and to evaluate the potential of the SSE scale as a tool for measuring search experience. Overall, participants from all eight studies reported similar levels of search self-efficacy; the overall average from all eight studies was 7.47 (items scored on a 10-point scale) with little variance (standard deviation=1.36). Both the lowest and highest scores (7.1 and 7.8) were observed in studies involving the general adult population. A factor analysis showed that the questionnaire items load onto six factors, although only four had sufficient numbers of items loading on them. These four factors represent overall task success, effective use of time, query development skills, and advanced search skills.},

abstract = {There is an ongoing debate on personalization, adapting results to the unique user exploiting a user's personal history, versus customization, adapting results to a group profile sharing one or more characteristics with the user at hand. Personal profiles are often sparse, due to cold start problems and the fact that users typically search for new items or information, necessitating to back-off to customization, but group profiles often suffer from accidental features brought in by the unique individual contributing to the group. In this paper we propose a generalized group profiling approach that teases apart the exact contribution of the individual user level and the `abstract' group level by extracting a latent model that captures all, and only, the essential features of the whole group. Our main findings are the followings.First, we propose an efficient way of group profiling which implicitly eliminates the general and specific features from users' models in a group and takes out the abstract model representing the whole group.Second, we employ the resulting models in the task of contextual suggestion. We analyse different grouping criteria and we find that group-based suggestions improves the customization. Third, we see that the granularity of groups affects the quality of group profiling. We observe that grouping approach should compromise between the level of customization and groups' size.},

abstract = {One goal of using simulated work tasks in interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiments is to create a more relevant and interesting search experience for study participants. However, there is not much guidance about how to identify interesting tasks or how interest in a task impacts search behaviors and experiences, which is the purpose of this study. In this study, we created eight work tasks and asked forty participants to rank these tasks from most interesting to least interesting before they came into the lab for an IIR experiment. During the experiment, we asked participants to conduct searches for the two tasks they ranked as most interesting and the two they ranked as least interesting. Participants completed pre- and post-search questionnaires to characterize their interests in the tasks and their search experiences, including engagement. Participants rated their interest, prior knowledge and search experience, and the relevancy of interesting tasks significantly higher than uninteresting tasks. They also predicted these tasks would be significantly less difficult to complete. Participants reported significantly greater engagement with interesting tasks and they spent longer completing these tasks. However, there were no significant differences in participants' search behaviors including number of queries issued, number of SERPs, or number of documents bookmarked. These results provide evidence that our method of assigning tasks to participants that would interest and engage them, at least cognitively, if not behaviorally, was somewhat successful. This method can be used by others conducting laboratory IIR studies.},

abstract = {Passive consumption of information is boring in most cases and even painful in some cases, especially when the information content is delivered by employing speech media. The user of a speech-based information delivery system, for example a text-to-speech system, usually cannot interrupt the ongoing information flow, inhibiting her/him to confirm some part of the content, or to pose an inquiry for further information exploration. We argue that a carefully designed spoken dialog system could remedy these undesirable situations, and further enable an enjoyable conversation with the users. The key technologies to realize such an attractive dialog system are: (1) pre-compilation of a dialog plan based on the analysis of a source content, and (2) the dynamic recognition of user's state of understanding and interests. This paper illustrates technical views to implement these functionalities, and discusses a dialog example to exemplify the technical merits of the proposed system.},

Various lexical and distributional semantic features are implemented and feature analysis shows that participants with low familiarity tend to alter the spelling and use stemming for QR whereas participants with medium or higher familiarity are inclined to add new terms and phrases to reformulate queries.},

In particular, touch-based interfaces enable users to use their own fingers to manipulate and interact with digital objects in a more direct fashion than mouse-based interactions. However, it is not clear yet to what extent, if any, this type of interaction could help bridge the gap between users and the digital world in particular information-related contexts such as information search. In this paper we report preliminary results of a user study designed to compare mouse and touch-based interactions in the context of an image search task. This study is part of a larger research project focused on immersive interaction with digital information objects. Our results show that in spite of the novelty, high adoption rates, and tangible nature of touch-based interfaces, no significant differences exist with prevalent technology (i.e., mouse) in terms of performance; nevertheless, user experience was found to better in touch-based interactions.},

In this paper, we propose TwIST (Twitter Information Search Tool), which has been designed to support interactive search and exploration within Twitter. TwIST is a mobile application that works in two modes: simple search and exploratory search. The searcher can easily change between these modes by rotating the device, making it easy to access the mode that will support the desired search activity. While the simple search mode is dominated by the common search results list format, the exploratory search mode uses topic modelling, visualization, and interactive filtering to support the searcher in finding the information they are seeking.},

To understand users' behavior and their interests in the cultural heritage domain, we have logged onsite user interaction logs of visits in a museum. This prompts the question on the reliability of the social information being gathered from the onsite logs: How does the position of museum objects affect users' behavior in the museum? How does order of visiting point of interests affect their dwell-time in front of each point of interest? How do different users' characteristics affect their behavior in the museum? In short, what are different kinds of biases that should be considered in the onsite logs? Our main findings are the following: First, there is a considerable position bias, which is due to the design of the exhibition and should be considered during extraction of social signals from the log. Second, there is a bias in the amount of time that users spend for interacting with the point of interests and the order of picking them to visit. This shows a fatigue on users' interactions while they are reaching to the end of the exhibition. Third, we find out some variations among the users' visit, which shows context is an important factor to consider while using onsite logs for different purposes.},

These system-oriented metrics are compared with users' self-rated search performance and task difficulty for a session. Experimental results show that nsDCG and esNDCG have reasonable but weak correlations with the user metrics, while the worst and the last query's nDCG in a session have comparably strong correlations.

abstract = {Increasing evidence from psychoanalytic and psychodynamic research suggests that the unconscious influences our daily decisions, and psychologists have suggested that as much as 85-95% of decision making occurs outside our conscious awareness. For information science, it is important to understand how these unconscious processes play a role in information seeking. The current study uses subliminal psychodynamic activation (SPA), through the use of subliminal messages that appeared below the threshold of conscious awareness, to investigate the influence of the unconscious in information searching. Twenty-four college students participated in a controlled laboratory experiment, each searching freely on the Internet for information for three search tasks, with various SPA messages appearing in each search. Participants were systematically assigned to one of the four SPA conditions with various subliminal messages. Users' perceptions of search task topic interest, topic knowledge and task difficulty was examined between different SPA conditions, as well as the change of users' perceptions on topic interest, knowledge, and difficulty before and after searching in different SPA conditions. Findings suggested that users' pre- and post-task ratings of topic interest, knowledge, and difficulty did not show significant differences among the 4 SPA conditions. However, the change in users' perceptions of topic interest and topic knowledge before and after searching showed significant differences when SPA messages were present. Our findings inspire future research in this underexplored field.},

In most of the previous works, time is usually an objective factor measured by timing devices. However, the time perceived by user seems more intuitive to describe the impact of time because search user's opinion is considered subjective. Psychological researches have reported that time perception can be affected by many physical and psychological factors. In this work, a laboratory study with 50 participants was adopted to investigate the impact of Temporal Relevance, e.g., the awareness of elapsed time, on time perception of Web search users. Experimental results show that participants in high temporal relevance environments tend to perceive significantly longer task durations than the actual ones. It shows that the perception of time can be manipulated in Web search scenario and reveals the necessity to take the factor of user perception into consideration in time-related Web search researches such as effort-based evaluation.},

Further, we provide a method to categorize users into focused, multi-taskers or supertaskers depending on their level of task-multiplicity and show that the search effort expended by these users varies across the groups. The findings from this analysis provide useful insights about task-multiplicity in an online search environment and hold potential value for search engines that wish to personalize and support search experiences of users based on their task behavior.},

abstract = {Typical search engines for spoken content begin with some form of language-specific audio processing such as phonetic word recognition. Many languages, however, lack the language tuned preprocessing tools that are needed to create indexing terms for speech. One approach in such cases is to rely on repetition, detected using acoustic features, to find terms that might be worth indexing. Experiments have shown that this approach yields term sets that might be sufficient for some applications in both spoken term detection and ranked retrieval experiments. Such approaches currently work only with spoken queries, however, and only when the searcher is able to speak in a manner similar to that of the speakers in the collection. This demonstration paper proposes Vapor Engine, a new tool for selectively transcribing repeated terms that can be automatically detected from spoken content in any language. These transcribed terms could then be matched to queries formulated using written terms. Vapor Engine is early in development: it currently supports only single-term queries and has not yet having been formally evaluated. This paper introduces the interface and summarizes the challenges it seeks to address.},

Comments, tags, ratings, and advertising might or might not be perceived as part of the resource whether they are retrieved as part of the primary URI or accessed via a link. Similarly, whether content accessible via links, tabs, or other navigation available at the primary URI is perceived as part of the resource may depend on the design of the website. We are examining what people believe are the bounds of Internet resources with the hope of informing systems that better match user perceptions. To understand this challenge we explore a situation where the user is assumed to have identified a resource by a URI, particularly for archiving. To begin to answer these questions, we asked 110 participants how desirable it would be for web contents related to an identified archived resource to also be archived. Results indicate that the features important to this decision likely vary considerably from resource to resource.},

abstract = {Relevance is a complex, but core, concept within the field of Information Retrieval. In order to allow system comparisons the many factors that influence relevance are often discarded to allow abstraction to a single score relating to relevance. This means that a great wealth of information is often discarded. In this paper we outline the creation of a video test collection with graded relevance assessments, to the best of our knowledge the first example of such a test collection for video retrieval. To directly address the shortcoming above we also gathered behavioural and perceptual data from assessors during the assessment process. All of this information along with judgements are available for download. Our intention is to allow other researchers to supplement the judgements to help create an adaptive test collection which contains supplementary information rather than a completely static collection with binary judgements.},

Five physicians performed two simulated clinical scenarios consisting of 9 tasks using the EHR. Tasks were categorized into simple vs. complex tasks based on the user, task and context characteristics by the subject matter expert. Usability was assessed using four methods, (1) subjectively using subject's informal feedback and usability expert's heuristics, (2) workload measures using eye tracking, (3) behavior measures using clicks and navigation windows, and (4) performance measures using actual time on task and predictive time based on CogTool ©. Overall, the results suggest that heuristic methods (1) are highly effective in identifying usability issues, with other methods (2-4) providing complementary analysis to identify differences is task complexly and user experience with EHRs.},

abstract = {Recently developed retrieval effectiveness measures have incorporated models of user behavior, but have limited themselves to predicting user performance over a single query and response. Accurate prediction of user performance with search systems must incorporate a means to model how users switch between different information sources. For example, a search session may consist of multiple queries with the user making decisions of when to switch from evaluating the current result list to a new result list produced by a query reformulation. Likewise, users may switch to a result list produced by a query suggestion or other interaction mechanism that produces a new search result list. In this paper, we simulate user behavior and investigate optimal switching behavior for a user who must decide when and if to issue their current query to another search engine. As a first step in understanding the problem space, we restrict our investigation and discussion to two top performing runs submitted to the TREC 2005 Robust track. We find four classes of switching behavior that a user would be faced with in making a decision about whether to switch from one result list to another.},

However, little is known about how individual differences influence users' selection of online sources for health information. This study intends to fill this gap by exploring the impact of a number of individual characteristics on users' selection of five online sources (search engines, social Q&amp;A sites, social networking sites (SNSs), online health communities, and crowdsourcing sites) for three distinct types of health-related search task (factual, exploratory, and personal experiences). We found that individuals' health literacy and frequency of using a source are the most significant predictors of their source selections across task types. Preference for information has an impact on users' selection of SNSs for exploratory tasks. Extraversion personality has an impact on users' selection of search engines for tasks that seek personal experiences. Nevertheless, demographic factors, including gender, income, and health status, do not predict users' selection of online sources for health information.},

However, reliable measures of experience in these cases are limited. Other areas of information interaction, e.g., online search, news, and shopping, are increasingly exploring and attempting to measure the concept of user engagement (UE). In this study, we ask whether UE is an appropriate outcome for the utilitarian activities of online form-filling and transactions.We describe work in progress which measures UE using the User Engagement Scale (UES) with utilitarian tasks, and which looks for behaviours which correlate with the UES. Early results suggest that, first, the UES can be adapted to such situations; and second, that readily observable user behaviours including time on site, mouse movements, and keypresses correlate with UES sub-scales and can, to some extent, predict users' responses.},

Preliminary user studies with professional electronic music producers point up the frustration and laboriousness of finding suitable drum samples in the increasingly large libraries of sounds available, and suggest the need for alternative interfaces and approaches. To address this issue, two novel spatial visualizations (respectively organized by name and by timbre-similarity) are designed as potential alternatives to the traditional 1D list-based browsers. These visualizations are implemented and compared in a music creation task, in terms of both the exploration experience and the resulting production quality, within a system for drum kit configuration. Our study shows that spatial visualizations do improve the overall exploration experience, and reveals the potential of similarity-based arrangements for the support of creative processes.},

Recently, some approaches have proposed entity based extraction of tasks, where they either use entities as features or construct task dictionaries that contain multiple tasks. While text based features do not exploit entities directly, task dictionaries do not provide concise or distinct representation of tasks. We overcome these shortcomings by extracting category oriented tasks by exploiting properties of an existing, publicly available category hierarchy. We evaluate quality of these tasks with implicit, explicit and application based evaluation. Empirical evaluation shows that category based task extraction results in more accurate and useful tasks.},

abstract = {For two decades, research has sought to understand serendipity and how it may be facilitated in digital environments such as information visualizations systems, search systems, and social media. The motivation to support serendipity comes from its association with positive outcomes that range from personal benefits to global rewards. To date, research has made significant headway in defining and mapping the process of serendipity and new tools are emerging to support it. Creative and robust heuristics and methods of evaluation, however, are required to help move the research forward, to ensure that new or enhanced features, functions, or tools are providing affordances as intended. Without sound approaches, we are blind as to what facilitates serendipity and proposed heuristics to aid practitioners are speculative. SEADE (pronounced 'seed') is a one-day workshop that will examine how we balance the tension between diversity and novelty in designing digital environments and subsequently how we evaluate the 'serendipitousness' of those environments. Since 2006, in its earlier iterations as IIiX and HCIR, CHIIR has served as a venue for the discussion of user-centred information interaction in context. CHIIR provides an ideal venue for bringing together researchers from diverse information and computer science communities and beyond working on the problem of providing support for serendipity in digital environments.},

The theoretical framework of this study is driven from Vygotsky and Nisbett's theory of cultural cognition. According to this theory, culture has a significant impact on how we organize our thoughts and our relationships, how we perceive the world, and how we decide to behave and act.

In recent years, there has been a renewed interest towards using simulation for Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR), an area which focuses on the study of human interactions with IR systems. A variety of different interaction models (e.g. click models) associated with behavioural aspects of searchers have over time been developed and evaluated using simulation in order for us to better understand the complex processes involved. Despite these advances, such models are still relatively na\"{\i}ve, and further work is required to make simulations of searchers more realistic. To this end, this project seeks to build more realistic simulations, using a more Complex Searcher Model (CSM). Within the CSM, each component and decision point can be varied and customised as required. The CSM can then be instantiated using components that are grounded from empirical evidence based upon actual real-world searcher behaviour and interaction data.},

Information-based ideation refers to open-ended activities in which humans work to imagine, generate, and develop new problems and solutions. We use web semantics as a basis for summarizing and representing heterogeneous content from diverge sources involved in ideation tasks. To enable working with web semantics, we develop a novel type system that brings together data models, dynamic extraction, and presentation of semantic information. Based on the web semantics type system, we build interfaces that preserve contexts during exploratory browsing, and plan to build integrated interactive environments to address exploratory search, curation, and ideation. We will investigate how integrated environments affect people's practices with finding and combining information, and derive new principles for supporting exploratory search, browsing, curation, and ideation. Methods, techniques, and findings developed through this research have the potential to transform infrastructures and human experiences of the web.},

We focused on studying EBM practitioners' searching behaviors during EBM process. However, in this paper we only present analysis for query issuing pattern and result viewing behavior of the retrieval process. We collected our preliminary data using Morae's Key-Logging software that captures participants' information searching behavior. We recorded 30 preliminary search sessions via convenience sampling and analyzed our data using descriptive statistics. Our findings indicate that 90% of the search sessions successfully returned results that the participants searched for. Among the queries issued, 24.47% were ineffective queries. Result viewing behaviors revealed 56 online sources were clicked where 33.33% belonged to PubMed, Medscape and UpToDate. Our result shows higher average query length and the number of medical terms used in queries compared to previous studies. We also found that result viewing behavior using multiple tabs confuses the participants and are more likely to cause overlooking of online resources on some of the opened tabs. The outcome of our study leads to better initiatives on query issuing and result viewing strategies for EBM related searches to improve the EBM process among practitioners.},

abstract = {This research investigates a new interface paradigm for interactive information retrieval (IIR) which forces us to shift away from the classic "ten blue links" search engine results page. Instead we investigate how to present search results through a conversation over a speech-only communication channel where no screen is available. Accessing information via speech is becoming increasingly pervasive and is already important for people with a visual impairment. However, presenting search results over a speech-only communication channel is challenging due to cognitive limitations and the transient nature of audio. Studies have indicated that the implementation of speech recognizers and screen readers must be carefully designed and cannot simply be added to an existing system. Therefore the aim of this research is to develop a new interaction framework for effective and efficient IIR over a speech-only channel: a Spoken Conversational Search System (SCSS) which provides a conversational approach to defining user information needs, presenting results and enabling search reformulations. In order to contribute to a more efficient and effective search experience when using a SCSS, we intend for a tighter integration between document search and conversational processes.},

abstract = {Non-native English users search for information on websites that mostly present content in English. There has been increasing concern as to whether web users who speak non-native English languages can access information as effectively as native English users. Few studies have been done on how multi-lingual users search for information in two or more languages online, specifically how they switch languages in order to get satisfying search results. This research investigates the factors that impact native Chinese users' code-switching (Chinese-English) search behaviors when they seek information online and the challenges that users encounter. The methods of this research consist of two phases. In-context interviews will allow us to explore natural behaviors in the users' context in the first phase. Fifteen native Chinese participants will be recruited. A controlled eye-tracking study is planned for the second phase in order to examine different reading patterns of these bilingual web users and what web elements they focus on. Thirty native Chinese will be recruited in this phase. The research aims to explore when, how, and why users switch languages, and examine the role of languages that users select in online searches.},

abstract = {Literature on Health Information Seeking Behavior (HISB) are available and well documented in developed countries. People in developed countries have also better understanding and awareness on online health information sources. However, the research coverage is very limited in developing countries, especially among college students. Previous studies showed higher risks of chronic diseases, stress, and risky sexual behavior among college students. Improving their HISB has the potential to reduce these risks. Our proposed research attempts to describe HISB and its associated factors in developing country with a specific focus on a college student population. Our study will attempt to create a better understanding of HISB in developing country thereby making it available for health promotional activities. It will also have potential contribution to suggest design strategies to improve health information retrieval systems.},
