abstract = {Multimedia information retrieval in digital libraries is a difficult task for computers in general. Humans on the other hand are experts in      perception, concept representation, knowledge organization and memory   retrieval. Cognitive psychology and science describe how cognition works in humans, but can offer valuable clues to information retrieval researchers   as well. Cognitive psychologists view the human mind as a general-purpose   Ysymbol-processing system that interacts with the world. A multimedia        Yinformation retrieval system can also be regarded as a symbol-processing    system that interacts with the environment. Its underlying information      retrieval model can be seen as a cognitive framework that describes how  the describe the design and implementation of a combined text/image          retrieval system (as an example of a multimedia retrieval system) that is   inspired by cognitive theories such as Paivio's dual coding theory and      Marr's theory of perception. User interaction and an automatically created  thesaurus that maps text concepts and internal image concept representations, generated by various feature extraction algorithms,   improve the query formulation process of the image retrieval system. Unlike most``multimedia databases'' found in literature, this image retrieval system uses the the functionality provided by an extensible multimedia DBMSthat itself is part of an open distributed environment.},

abstract = {Digital library search results are usually shown as a textual list,    with 10-20 items per page. Viewing several thousand search results at once on a two-dimensional display with continuous variables is a promising       alternative. Since these displays can overwhelm some users, we created a    simplified two-dimensional display that uses categorical and hierarchical   axes, called hieraxes. Users appreciate the meaningful and limited number   of terms on each hieraxis. At each grid point of the display we show a      cluster of color-coded dots or a bar chart. Users see the entire result set and can then click on labels to move down a level in the hierarchy.         Handling broad hierarchies and arranging for imposed hierarchies led to     additional design innovations. We applied hieraxes to a digital video   library of science topics used by middle school teachers, a legal   information system, and a technical library using the ACM Computing Classification System. Feedback from usability testing with 32 subjects revealed strengths and weaknesses.},

The  essential data structures and algorithms for the DTD generation have been   delveloped and experiments on real Web collections have been conducted to   demonstrate their feasibilty.

abstract = {The automatic document metadata extraction process is animportant task in a world where thousands of documents are just one``click'' away. Thus,   powerful indices are necessary to support effective retrieval. The upcoming XML standard represents an important step in this direction as itssemistructuredrepresentation conveys document metadata  together with the text of the document.  For example, retrieval of          scientific papers by authors or affiliations would be a straightforward     tasks if papers were stored in XML.Unfortunately, today, the largest majority of documents on the web are available in forms that do not carryadditional semantics.  Converting existing documents to a semistructured representation is time consuming and no automatic process can be easily applied. In this paper we discuss a system, based on a novel spatial/visualknowledge principle, for extracting metadata from scientific papers storedas PostScript files. Our system embeds the general knowledge about the graphical layout of a scientific paper to guide the metadata extraction process. Our system can effectively assist the automatic index creation for digital libraries.},

These examples are used to generate extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the document collection.We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples from plain-text documents.At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,and keeps only the most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics for our task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of   Snowball and comparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaper documents.},

However, digital libraries should provide more than advanced collection maintenance and retrieval services since the ultimate goal of any (academic) library is to serve the scholarly needs of its users. This paper begins by presenting a case for digital scholarship in which patrons perform all scholarly work electronically. A proposal is then made for patron-augmented digital libraries (PADLs), a class of digital libraries that supports the digital scholarship of its patrons. Finally, a prototype PADL (called Synchrony) providing access to video segments and associated textual transcripts is described. Synchrony allows patrons to search the library for artifacts, create annotations/original compositions, integrate these artifacts to form synchronized mixed text and video presentations and, after suitable review, publish these presentations into the digital library if desired. A study to evaluate the PADL concept and the usability of Synchrony is also discussed. The study revealed that participants were able to use Synchrony for the authoring and publishing of presentations and that attitudes toward PADLs were generally positive.},

abstract = {Building machine readable collections of musical scores is a tedious and time consuming task. The most common interface for performing music data entry is a mouse and toolbar system; using the mouse, the user selects a rhythm (note shape) from a toolbar, then drags the note to the correct position on the staff. We compare the usability of a hybrid speech and mouse-driven interface to a traditional mouse-driven one. The speech-enhanced interface allows users to enter note rhythms by voice, while still using the mouse to indicate pitches. While task completion time is nearly the same, users (N=13) significantly preferred the speech-augmented interface. A second study using the first two authors of this paper (N=2) indicates that experienced users can enter music 11% faster with the speech interface. Many users expressed a desire to enter pitches, as well as rhythms, by speech. A third study, however, shows that the recognizer is unable to reliably distinguish among A, B, C, D, E, F and G (N=10).},

abstract = {Well within our lifetime we can expect to see most information being created, stored and used digitally. Despite the growing importance of digital data, the wider community pays almost no attention to the problems of preserving this digital information for the future. Even within the archival and library communities most work on digital preservation has been theoretical, not practical, and highlights the problems rather than giving solutions. Physical libraries have to preserve information for long periods and this is no less true of their digital equivalents. This paper describes the preservation approach adopted in the Victorian Electronic Record Strategy (VERS) which is currently being trialed within the Victorian government, one of the states of Australia. We review the various preservation approaches that have been suggested and describe in detail encapsulation, the approach which underlies the VERS format. A key difference between the VERS project and previous digital preservation projects is the focus within VERS on the construction of actual systems to test and implement the proposed technology. VERS is not a theoretical study in preservation.},

We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization.  Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can produce accurate recommendations.},

This paper describes a case study that uses an automatically constructed phrase hierarchy to facilitate browsing of an ordinary large Web site. Phrases are extracted from the full text using a novel combination of rudimentary syntactic processing and sequential grammar induction techniques. The interface is simple, robust and easy to use.To convey a feeling for the quality of the phrases that are generated automatically, a thesaurus used by the organization responsible for the Web site is studied and its degree of overlap with the phrases in the hierarchy is analyzed. Our ultimate goal is to amalgamate hierarchical phrase browsing and hierarchical thesaurus browsing: the latter provides an authoritative domain vocabulary and the former augments coverage in areas the thesaurus does not reach.},

abstract = {Modification and reuse of digital contents, particularly web data, has become easy due to advancement in computer technology. The work created by a person (or a group of persons) can be reused by another person (or group) for different purpose. Thus, there can be multiple copyright holders for the same information. In such scenario, it is important to define the relationship among the copyright holders. There have been some attempts at designing the Electronic Copyright Management System (ECMS) cite{6,7}. However, this system is used for defining and registering the information of one copyright holder. Another attempt to develop copyright management systems is reported in cite{indecs}. The key feature of this system is that they have an RDF expression for copyright metadata. When  multiple creators take part in creating one content or when contents are created reusing existing contents, it is vital to define the relationship among copyright holders. This relationship should be clarified in order to make proper allocation of profits and protect rights of all the copyright holders. Therefore, a framework is required where the relationship among copyright holders and profit allocations are described. In this paper we outline the main points of such framework. We refer the readers to see cite{tr-wmu} for a detailed description. The proposed framework also represents copyright processing for multiple rights holders, it gives a framework for realizing transaction systems where reuse for creating new contents is promoted. In this paper we also outline the conceptual model designed for describing copyright information, examining the relationship among rights holders, and modeling charge rules.},

abstract = {Taiwan is renown for its great variety of butterflies. There are about 400 species, a number of which unique to Taiwan, over its 36,500 sq km land. Last year we built a comprehensive digital collection of Taiwan's butterflies to provide a modern research environment on butterflies for academic institutions, as well as an interactive butterfly educational environment for the general public. Our digital museum emphasizes on the ease to use, and provides a number of innovative features to help the user fully utilize the information provided by the system. The digital museum is accessible through the Web at http://digimuse.nmns.edu.tw.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose an integration between electronic mail and web services for people such as library operators who need to send large files to Internet users. The proposed solution permits libraries to continue using the e-mail service to send large documents, but at the same time overcomes problems that users can encounter downloading large size files with e-mail agents. The library operator sends the document as an attachment to the destination address, on fly the e-mail server extracts and saves the attachments in a web-server disk file and substitutes them with a new messsage part that includes the URL pointing to the saved document. The reciever can download these large objects using a user-friendly browser.},

abstract = {What is infrastructure and how shall we know it? As libraries move partly to desktops, one of the challenges facing the digital library community becomes designing for distributed use across many kinds of local circumstance. These circumstances vary widely in terms of people, resources, support, and technical configurations. Designing for this variety means reconceptualizing “user meets screen” as “user meets infrastructure.” This requires scaling up traditional design and evaluation methods, as well as a richer knowledge of the organizational and historical contexts of use. This talk addresses some of the methodological challenges involved in such work.Susan Leigh Star (Leigh) is Professor of Communication at the University of California, San  Diego. She received her Ph.D in sociology of science and medicine from UC San Francisco. Before coming to UCSD in 1999, she was Professor of Information Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She has also taught at UC Irvine and Keele University, in England, and several universities in Scandinavia as guest professor. Much of her research has been on the social implications and design of large-scale technology, especially information technology. Among her publications are "The Cultures of Computing" (ed) (Blackwell, 1995), "Regions of the Mind: Brain Research and the Quest for Scientific Certainty" (Stanford 1989), and (with Geoffrey Bowker), "Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences" (MIT, 1999).  She is volume editor for Science and Technology for the Women's Studies International Encyclopedia (edited by Cheris Kramarae and Dale Spender), forthcoming from Routledge in 2000.  Her current research concerns ethical and methodological dilemmas in on-line research with human subjects.},

abstract = {This panel will address some of the practical issues of implementing digital libraries. Everyone seems to agree that digital libraries are in their infancy. Many of us watch in amazement as new developments occur. In the year 2000 building a production digital library means analyzing tradeoffs between stability, innovation, and costs/benefits. In this panel we will address some of the more interesting issues of digital library implementation.One of the critical challenges is the economics of digital libraries. Institutions are forming consortia out of necessity and this raises issues of trust, cooperation and commitment. In order for institutions to deliver web-based resources effectively sophisticated cross-organizational access management tools are needed to  authenticate and authorize.Institutions are developing new tools and exporting them from research departments into libraries. How well does this collaboration work?The above issues are only a sampling of the challenges this panel will explore.},

abstract = {Digital Libraries (DLs) are social as well as technological entities. Their purpose is to help people do knowledge work, to carry knowledge processes across space and time. DLs are designed, used, and evaluated in a context of work and community. And DLs interact with this context, changing and being changed by it. Effective DLs must be designed and evaluated with a sensitivity to how knowledge is created and understood, and work is done, in a context of knowledge communities, which share practices and tools. DL use is a socially-embedded process. DL development is likewise a complex social process. This panel grows out of a book on social approaches to DL design and evaluation--currrently in press--to which the moderator and each panelist has contributed a chapter. The purpose of  the  panel is to present socially grounded approaches to understanding DLs; to identify and discuss major issues that arise from these approaches and, more generally, from the social nature of DLs; and to consider implications for the design and evaluation of DLs.},
