abstract = {Peepholes are virtual windows to large workspaces. Using a peephole provides an intuitive interface onto information spaces too large to be viewed on the screen of a mobile device. To date, these peephole systems have relied on tethered tracking devices or string connected to a desktop mouse to provide input to the system. In this paper, we investigate the use of the cameras on current camera-phones as an untethered and more readily available input device. We present various image processing algorithms and how we refined the final algorithm which converted the camera input to directional information. This algorithm was then tested in a map-browsing application. Whilst the final implementation suffered from performance limitations, we believe that using higher-end smartphones with higher quality cameras and faster processors will ultimately provide useful solutions.},

abstract = {We propose a probabilistic movement model for controlling ant-like agents foraging between two points. Such agents are all identical, simple, autonomous and can only communicate indirectly through the environment. These agents secrete two types of pheromone, one to mark trails towards the goal and another to mark trails back to the starting point. Three pheromone perception strategies are proposed (Strategy A, B and C). Agents that use strategy A perceive the desirability of a neighbouring location as the difference between levels of attractive and repulsive pheromone in that location. With strategy B, agents perceive the desirability of a location as the quotient of levels of attractive and repulsive pheromone. Agents using strategy C determine the product of the levels of attractive pheromone with the complement of levels of repulsive pheromone. We conduct experiments to confirm directionality as emergent property of trails formed by agents that use each strategy. In addition, we compare path formation speed and the quality of the formed path under changes in the environment. We also investigate each strategy's robustness in environments that contain obstacles. Finally, we investigate how adaptive each strategy is when obstacles are eventually removed from the scene and find that the best strategy of these three is strategy A. Such a strategy provides useful guidelines to researchers in further applications of swarm intelligence metaphors for complex problem solving.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for converting unrestricted fiction text into a time-based graphical form. Key concepts extracted from the text are used to formulate constraints describing the interaction of entities in a scene. The solution of these constraints over their respective time intervals provides the trajectories for these entities in a graphical representation.Three types of entity are extracted from fiction books to describe the scene, namely Avatars, Areas and Objects. We present a novel method for modeling the temporal aspect of a fiction story using multiple time-line representations after which the information extracted regarding entities and time-lines is used to formulate constraints. A constraint solving technique based on interval arithmetic is used to ensure that the behaviour of the entities satisfies the constraints over multiple universally quantified time intervals. This approach is demonstrated by finding solutions to multiple time-based constraints, and represents a new contribution to the field of Text-to-Scene conversion. An example of the automatically produced graphical output is provided in support of our constraint-based conversion scheme.},

Intrusion detection systems in particular have an increasingly valuable role to play: as networks grow and more information becomes available, administrators need better ways to monitor their systems. Most current intrusion detection systems lack the means to accurately monitor and report on wireless segments within the corporate network. This paper will propose an extension to the NeGPAIM model that will allow for the accurate detection of attacks originating on wireless network segments. This will be done by the use of fuzzy logic and neural networks utilized in the detection of intrusion attacks. The model is based on the assumption that each user has and leaves a unique footprint on a network when using it. This model is able to proactively detect intrusion attacks in both wired and wireless environments.},

abstract = {In recent years, intensive debate has raged over the significance of knowledge management within the business context. The adoption of knowledge management as a business imperative has relied heavily on its ability to deliver tangible value to businesses in the newly established knowledge economy. As with any other value-based initiative, it is necessary to measure knowledge management using explicit valuation methods. This requirement is particularly necessary within the IT service industry, where considerable opportunity exists for the use of knowledge resources. Wide-ranging studies by subject matter experts have been conducted into valuing knowledge management over the last two decades. In most cases, the research addressed the practical business challenges in relation to valuing knowledge. To realise the full impact of knowledge management requires expanding its value domains to encompass business relationships, human competence and organisational structure. The purpose of this research is to assess widely recognised methods and propose a consolidated methodology to measure the benefit value of knowledge management in an IT service provider environment. The resulting integrated knowledge benefit value model allows IT service organisations to select the aspects of measurement that are most appropriate and provides a planning and management tool for them to improve on their handling of knowledge resources.},

One proposed solution to this problem is the incorporation of a technological support tool to aid program comprehension in CS1. One such support tool (BeReT) is primarily designed to encourage a student to correctly identify beacons within provided program extracts. A between-groups experiment is described which compares the program comprehension of students that used BeReT to study various introductory algorithms, with students that relied solely on traditional lecturing materials. The use of an eye tracker was incorporated into the empirical study to provide additional data to measure the effect of BeReT. The results indicate that a technological support tool like BeReT can have a positive effect on student comprehension of introductory algorithms traditionally taught in CS1.},

abstract = {The case for chip multiprocessor (CMP) or multicore designs is strong, and increasingly accepted as evidenced by the growing number of commercial multicore designs. However, there is also some evidence that the quest for instruction-level parallelism, like the Monty Python parrot, is not dead but resting. The cases for CMP and ILP are complementary. A multitasking or multithreaded workload will do better on a CMP design; a floating-point application without many decision points will do better on a machine with ILP as its main parallelism. This paper explores a model for achieving both in the same design, by reconfiguring functional units on the fly. The result is a virtual multiprocessor (or vMP) which at the software level looks like either a uniprocessor with n clusters of functional units, or an n-core CMP, depending on how the data path is configured.},

As the amount of information rapidly increases, search engines require greater computational resources. Similarly, as the user base increases search engines need to handle increasing numbers of user requests. Existing solutions to these scalability problems are often designed for large computer clusters. This paper presents a flexible solution that is deployable also on small clusters. The solution is based on the allocation and dynamic re-adjustment of indexing and querying roles to cluster nodes in order to optimize cluster utilisation. By allocating cluster machines to the job that requires the most computational power, indexing and querying may both realize performance gains, while neither overwhelms the limited resources available. A prototype system was built and tested on a small cluster using a dataset of over 100 000 Web pages from the uct.ac.za domain. Initial results confirm an improved system resource utilisation, which warrants further investigation.},

After the advent of the WWW in the 1990s, questions have arisen regarding the relevance of previously established evaluation approaches to the evaluation of web-based IS. In this paper, we describe a holistic approach to Information Systems (IS) evaluation, focusing on web-based applications. In this context, a holistic perspective refers to a multi-stakeholder evaluation regarding perceptions of IS Success. The paper presents the results of a study in which a web-based IS at a national telecommunications company in South Africa was evaluated using e-Service Quality (e-SQ) constructs. The study demonstrates the operationalisation of an e-SQ instrument for the purposes of evaluating IS effectiveness amongst multi-stakeholders. Evidence is provided that measuring attitudes of different stakeholders provides a more holistic perspective of IS success.},

The paper will predominantly assess the extent to which the Agile software community's use of Kuhn's theory of revolutionary scientific change, particularly in Kent Beck's Extreme Programming (XP), is justified. It will be argued that whereas Kuhn's concepts of "scientific revolutions" and "paradigm shift" can partially explain the large-scale, radical change from "traditional" software methodologies to Agile ones, Popper's critical rationalism seems better suited to the small-scale, piecemeal methodological approach of Agile methodologies. The ethical implications to software engineering of Kuhn's and Popper's theories, as well as the work of the Peopleware authors and the architect, Christopher Alexander, will be discussed. Finally, the ideas of the Frankfurt School will be used to broaden the Popper versus Kuhn debate. A critical reflection on the soundness of applying theories of scientific methodology to the practice of software engineering concludes this paper.},

The induced OOD is then input to a genetic programming (GP) system to automatically generate the programs representing the classes. Each class program is evolved in an internal representation language. In order to test the system a translator was developed to convert the evolved class programs to Java. The hybrid system was used to induce object-oriented programs typical of a first course on object-oriented programming (OOP).

An empirical study was undertaken to elicit IAM challenges that occur within the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), which is responsible for the distribution of grants to underprivileged citizens. This paper presents the problems being experienced by SASSA and its stakeholders in the IAM domain and a possible solution to resolve a few of these problems.

The selection of usability evaluation methods (UEMs) to determine usability problems is influenced by time, cost, efficiency, effectiveness, and ease of application. Heuristic evaluation (HE) involves evaluation by experts with expertise in the domain area and/or HCI. This comparative evaluation study investigates the extent to which HE identifies usability problems in a web-based learning application and compares the results with those of survey evaluations among end-users (learners). Severity rating was conducted on a consolidated set of usability problems and further comparison of findings was done on the major and minor problems. The results of HE correspond closely with those of the survey. However the four expert evaluators identified more problems than the 61 learners and identified 91% of the learners' problems, when major problems only were considered. HE by a competent and balanced set of experts showed itself to be an appropriate, efficient and effective UEM for e-learning applications.},

abstract = {With the information revolution that promises to shape the 21st century, knowledge has become the prime commodity, very much like land, means of production and capital have been at different times in the past. Access to information, made instantly available by the growth of the Internet, determines access to economic resources, social participation and better quality of life. For this reason, the knowledge stored on the Web and the advantages offered by the spread of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are equally important for rich societies to prosper and for poor ones to develop. The only difference is that marginalised communities do not have access to the tools and have little control over the content found in the domain of ICTs. In this paper we describe an intervention to develop the potential of a typical rural community in South Africa through ICTs. This involves providing Internet connectivity and deploying a platform to support e-commerce, e-learning, e-government and e-health. The core of the platform is an ontology-based model designed to integrate and respond to Indigenous Knowledge Systems. This has been achieved by combining a deep understanding of local knowledge and social networks with the use of authoring, communication and ontology-management tools. The primary goal of this new approach is to find a way to make ICT solutions more sensitive to the local context, and therefore more effective. Secondly, we hope to foster a sense of ownership of the project among the community, by capitalising on local knowledge and resources.},

abstract = {Technology adoption models specify a pathway of technology acceptance from external variables to beliefs, intentions, adoption and actual usage. Mobile phone adoption has been studied from a variety of perspectives, including sociology, computer-supported cooperative work and human-computer interaction. What is lacking is a model integrating all these factors influencing mobile phone adoption. This paper investigates technology adoption models as a strategy to match mobile phone design to user's technological needs and expectations. Based on the literature study we integrate three existing technology adoption models and then evaluate the proposed model with interviews and a survey. The contribution of this paper is a model for representing the factors that influence mobile phone adoption.},

abstract = {New methods, methodologies and procedures are often introduced within information systems without discussing the effectiveness thereof. We investigate the effectiveness of a requirements elicitation procedure for deriving process model structures. There were three activities that 'rigged' this study before comments were possible on the effectiveness of the requirements elicitation procedure: identification of the characteristics that the procedure adhered to, investigating the usefulness of the procedure, and using the procedure. Each of these activities is discussed. The higher education institution is used as illustrative case domain.},

abstract = {The identification of process model structures is usually complex and costly. If these structures can be reused across boundaries, this could not only benefit the internal structure of one application domain, but could also benefit organizations where it is not feasible to initiate expensive process re-engineering innovations. Furthermore, a reusable process is not worth much if the process is not available. The preservation and availability of objects are therefore important, through libraries in the case of objects, or repositories in the case of process models. The creation of the MIT Process Handbook was a step in this direction. However, although the authors used object-oriented concepts in the abstract representations, they did not rigorously apply object-oriented concepts in the abstract representations used in publications on their process repository. Especially in the notation used and reference to specializations, there are some inconsistencies. To address these issues, we suggest the use of polymorphism, where specializations inherit from the generic base process model, and the use of more formal object-oriented notation for defining specialization.},

abstract = {Protecting access to data that can be linked to an individual (or personal identifiable information (PII)), thereby seeking to protect the individual's privacy can be accomplished through legislation, organisational safeguards, and technology. Of particular interest and the focus of this paper is the technological means by which data is protected, in particular we are considering the mechanisms of purpose binding and limitation which facilitate the organisational safeguards. Purpose binding allows an enterprise to specify their purpose with collected data, and purpose limitation controls access to information based on these purpose bindings.Technologies that implement the aforementioned safeguards of PII forms a subset of a set of technologies commonly referred to as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Many legacy systems do not employ these safeguards, even though it can be accomplished by providing "wrapper" technologies which reside on top of these legacy systems.This article continues work done by the authors in which extensions to SQL was proposed in order to integrate PETs with structured databases. The extensions showed that access to data through SQL can be controlled non-intrusively, and that the general discretionary access control model provided by many database management systems can still be enforced. In our previous work the extensions were limited to the SQL grant and select statements.In this article we propose a model for revoking privileges from database users, and thus consider the SQL revoke statement. We also show that the general principles of revoking privileges remain true for our proposed model. We also briefly consider extensions to the commands from the Data Manipulation Language (DML) that was not considered, being insert, delete, and update.},

abstract = {Self-tuning has been an elusive goal for operating systems and is becoming a pressing issue for modern operating systems. Well-trained system administrators are able to tune an operating system to achieve better system performance for a specific system class. Unfortunately, the system class can change when the running applications change. Our model for self-tuning operating system is based on a monitor-classify-adjust loop. The idea of this loop is to continuously monitor certain performance metrics, and whenever these change, the system determines the new system class and dynamically adjusts tuning parameters for this new class. This paper describes KernTune, a prototype tool that identifies the system class and improves system performance automatically. A key aspect of KernTune is the notion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) oriented performance tuning. It uses a support vector machine (SVM) to identify the system class, and tunes the operating system for that specific system class. This paper presents design and implementation details for KernTune. It shows how KernTune identifies a system class and tunes the operating system for improved performance.},

abstract = {One of the key factors affecting the growth of e-commerce is the lack of Internet users' confidence in online information privacy. Despite the importance of understanding the nature of the Internet users' concerns for information privacy, this topic is considered by many to be in the nascent stage. To fill the gap in the literature, this study examines the influence of demographic factors on Internet users' concerns for information privacy. Based on an empirical survey of 199 Internet users it was found that certain demographic factors, namely age, education and income level influence Internet users' concerns for information privacy. Others factors such as gender and Internet experience were found to have no influence. The implications of these and other findings are discussed.},
