abstract = {Grid Computing is used to solve complex scientific computing problems and uses large amounts of computing resources to do so. A Grid Computing architecture is inherently complex and differs significantly from other computing paradigms such as client-server technologies. Resource Discovery in particular is non-trivial in Grid Computing owing to the complex nature of its heterogeneous components, geographic distances between components and the dynamic nature of a typical Grid. An evaluation of three prominent approaches reveals that each technique was created for a specific type of Grid Computing architecture. On the strengths and shortcoming of these approaches, we propose a framework for an enhanced model for resource discovery in grid computing. Our model is inspired by Mobile agent- and Bio-ant technology, coupled with Ant Colony optimization techniques for improved ways of solving the resource discovery problem in grid computing.},

abstract = {In various countries, information and communication technology (ICT) is used to enhance and improve the levels and standards of education. Scholars in countries such as South Africa have conducted studies to prove that ICT can be essential in the improvement and enhancement of education. This study deals with the problem of the lack of ICT security awareness in South African education (among South African learners). Research studies that have been conducted have shown that there is a huge problem when it comes to integrating ICT security awareness into the South African schooling system. With the resurgence of new technologies such as Facebook, Twitter and Skype, school learners are more vulnerable to ICT security attacks and ICT-related crime than ever before. Even though the studies, models and frameworks have been conducted and proposed, there is still a gap when it comes to solutions that are directed specifically to South African school learners. Hence a more integrated approach in the form of a framework, directed mostly on South African school learners, has been proposed in this study. In this study, an in-depth literature review of past scholarly work, models and frameworks is done. Having reviewed some of the existing models and frameworks, and identified the potential gaps, a framework to address the aforementioned problem is proposed. The results of the literature review analysis and the proposed framework are reported and compared to support the gap analysis.},

abstract = {The Syntax-Free Approach (SFA) to teaching programming was proposed in response to the perceived challenges often faced by novice programmers while taking their first course in programming. The idea of the SFA is to provide a level of abstraction over the language syntax and teach programming to novices as algorithms instead of lines of code. In this paper, we report the development of a tool that translates novice programs into detailed textual algorithms using regular expressions. We refer to these algorithms as narrations. These narrations are syntax-free, can improve readability and aid the comprehension of programs. The technique described can also be employed for automatic generation of hints or tips for novice programmers during classroom or laboratory sessions.},

abstract = {Cloud computing offers a number of advantages for organisations looking to rent on-demand IT resources as a service. However, there are also uncertainties and challenges to cloud computing use that are tempering the rate of adoption. This paper contributes to our understanding of cloud computing adoption within South African firms by developing and testing a research model. Our model hypothesizes mimetic and normative institutional pressures, top management support, and the absorptive capacity of the firm as factors influencing cloud computing adoption. Data collected from 87 South African firms confirmed most hypothesized relationships, and supported institutional and absorptive capacity theories as explanations for adoption behavior. Top management support was found to be the most important factor influencing adoption and also partially mediated the effects of institutional pressures.},

abstract = {Alignment of Information Systems with organizational objectives and strategy is a key factor for the success of information systems. However, most health facilities have not aligned their Health Information Systems to organizational-wide strategic goals and objectives. This has led to challenges such us poor planning, lack of resources and above all the lack of direction by top management in implementing and using Health Information Systems. This research involved an assessment of the requirements for strategic alignment of health information systems in health facilities, development and validation of a strategic alignment model using selected health facilities.A multi-method research approach involving the use of quantitative and qualitative methods was used. The quantitative approach provided quantitative data that was used to generate requirements for the development of the model, as well as validating and testing of the system dynamics model. A sample of 408 respondents was taken from 39 health facilities in Uganda to participate in the study. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and presented in tables and graphs. The requirements for strategic alignment of Health Information Systems were identified as proper planning, establishment of policies, frameworks and standards, resource mobilization, establishment of work processes, training and sensitization of staff members about Health Information Systems work processes. Further, there is need to minimize time lag between HIS and other integrated organization information systems, improve on useful features and functions of HIS and also ensure the system covers all functions of the health facility. The study proposes a model, which when well used can help to improve the strategic alignment of Health Information Systems in health facilities.},

abstract = {While there is a noted increase in studies focusing on electronic commerce (e-Commerce) adoption and use, the adoption and use of e-Commerce by Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises in the hospitality sector (hospitality SMMEs) remains low. This has coincided with studies that focus on researching Information and Technology (IT) adoption until acquisition without any further analysis of whether the technology becomes an integral part of the business or not. Accordingly, this paper seeks to enhance the adoption and use of e-Commerce by hospitality SMMEs in the Eastern Cape Province. It uses qualitative multiple-case studies to evaluate a proposed model of advanced e-Commerce adoption and use by hospitality SMMEs. The model shows how hospitality SMMEs can attain advanced e-Commerce adoption and use. In particular, the model identifies factors of advanced e-Commerce adoption and use and describes characteristics of e-Commerce platforms for hospitality businesses. It goes on to propose a criterion for evaluating success in e-Commerce adoption and use.},

abstract = {Droughts remain the number one disaster in Africa; of all the people affected by all types disasters, drought is responsible for over 88% of them. An effective drought early warning system can support appropriate mitigation and preparedness strategies and hence minimize these effects. Existing systems tend to ignore the 'at risk' community and are faced with a number of implementation challenges; their utilisation is very low. This paper describes an effective drought early warning system that integrates indigenous and scientific drought forecasting approaches. The system is anchored on a novel integration framework called ITIKI (acronym for Information Technology and Indigenous Knowledge with Intelligence). Indigenous knowledge ensures that the system is relevant, acceptable and resilient. ITIKI further employs three ICTs (Mobile phones, wireless sensor networks and artificial intelligence) to enhance the system's effectiveness, affordability, sustainability and intelligence. This paper describes the design, development and evaluation of the system.},

abstract = {The emergence of cloud computing has transformed the potential of robotics by enabling multi-robotic teams to fulfil complex tasks in the cloud. This paradigm is known as "cloud robotics" and relieves robots from hardware and software limitations as large amounts of available resources and parallel computing capabilities are available in the cloud. A major challenge however, currently faced in cloud robotics is the inherent problem of cloud disconnection which would result in a robot not being able to fulfil certain tasks. This work serves to assist with the challenge of disconnection in cloud robotics by proposing a survivable cloud multi-robotics (SCMR) framework for heterogeneous environments. The SCMR framework leverages the combination of a virtual ad hoc network formed by the robot-to-robot communication and a physical cloud infrastructure formed by the robot-to-cloud communications. The Quality of Service (QoS) on the SCMR framework is tested and validated by determining the optimal energy utilization and Time of Response (ToR) on drivability analysis with and without cloud connection. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is feasible for current multi-robotic applications and shows the survivability aspect of the framework in instances of cloud disconnection.},

abstract = {Graduates with Business Process Management (BPM) competencies are highly sought after and Business Process (BP) modelling skills form an integral part of the BPM skillset. One challenge facing modellers is that only a few existing BP modelling languages have intuitive validation techniques which check for syntactic issues or rule violations. Not having an intuitive validation technique to support the effective and accurate creation of BP models can affect the success of BP modelling projects and have a negative impact on the operations of the business. In this paper a composite, real-time validation technique is proposed which provides both graphical and textual feedback. The Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC) modelling notation is used to demonstrate the proposed validation technique. Investigating the effectiveness and usability of the approach when implemented in a Microsoft Visio environment reveals that a composite, real-time validation technique reduces the volume of issues that typically are made during the modelling activity and enables modellers to distinguish between the severities of the different types of issues. The validation technique can also assist modellers in learning the rules and syntax of a modelling language.},

We designed the systems to assist people in low-income communities to share locally relevant information. Both involve communal displays, to record, store and share media, and users can transfer media between the display and their cell-phones. MXShare, which we report for the first time, also enables real-time, text-based chat but AR enables sharing only audio files asynchronously. Both systems were located at the same sites for community communication and co-present oral practices effected media recording and sharing. Their use reinforced differentiations in sharing information between older and younger people. We argue that designing social media systems to widen information access must respond to complex interactions between social structures and genres of communication.},

abstract = {As mobile Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) become greater entrenched in society and with the nature of work changing, more and more international organizations are embracing and/or considering formalizing the phenomenon of 'Bring Your Own Device' (BYOD). The gist of BYOD is the use of privately owned devices and software to access and work with organizational resources. There is however little that is known about the degree to which organizations in South Africa are embracing the BYOD phenomenon. In this paper, we explored how employees in organizations in South Africa perceive the use of their privately owned devices for work. The results from 61 employees suggest that there is a strong awareness of the BYOD concept among employees. Employees also appear to believe that although their employers are aware of the use of privately owned devices for work, the employers are reluctant to formally create BYOD organizational strategies. The findings suggest that the laxity of employers in South Africa to deal with the BYOD phenomenon as an issue of strategic importance could result in considerable security challenges for organizational data.},

We explore the link between creativity and emotional design in order to evolve a conceptual framework for studying creativity in the fast growing area of mobile applications (apps) development. Action research, which is regarded as participatory, emancipatory and contextual, was adopted in this study. The study used a case study design and a survey of 1,502 students registered for a first year course in Management Information Systems at a large urban University in South Africa. Results from this study found that for app development to be more creative and innovative, emotional design should be part of the broader process of improving requirements engineering in Information Systems Development (ISD). We also found that in situations where emotional feedback is genuine, requirements engineering problems related to the "misinformation effect" common in ISD can be minimized. The third claim we affirm stronger is how users in ISD play a closer role as co-developers of mobile apps in order to realize true creativity and innovativeness. This study further demonstrated how subjective feelings in ISD can be evaluated using visual artifacts such as the Emocard.},

Results: On system accuracy, the sensitivity of the Bacis program matched present norms in maternity care. On usability, the nurses expressed satisfaction with the Bacis program as a tool for them. There was a statistically significant improvement in compliance of nurses to the maternity care guidelines after implementation of the Bacis program for three out of nine categories in maternity care. On resource utilization, the Bacis program is expected to piggyback on existing infrastructure. Other resources were also assessed such as time, human resources and policies, and Bacis program implementation was judged to be feasible. Conclusion: This study has yielded important data on implementation of e-health decision support systems at primary health care level in South Africa.},

abstract = {Given the widespread use of computer technologies and mounting concerns over its impact on climate change, energy consumption and environmental degradation, one would imagine that IT workers would be practicing and advocating green computing behaviors. Employing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study therefore set out to examine the influence of factors such as attitude, social influence, media influence, perceived behavioral control and environmental concern on the IT worker's green computing intention. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 149 respondents within a large financial services firm in Gauteng. Descriptive statistics suggest that personal awareness, knowledge and actual green computing behaviors are low. Regression analysis indicates that environmental concern, perceived behavioral control, attitude, and media influence are important predictors while social influence plays almost no role -- suggesting that IT workers are under no social pressure to practice green computing. The paper recommends that responsible peers, firms, higher education institutions, and media focus their attention on driving environmental awareness in order to promote green computing behaviors among seemingly unaware and disempowered IT workers.},

abstract = {Modern digital library systems are increasingly handling massive data volumes; this content needs to be stored, indexed and made easily accessible to end users. Cloud computing promises to address some of these needs through a set of services that arguably support scalability of service provision. This paper discusses a set of experiments to assess the scalability of typical digital library services that use cloud computing facilities for core processing and storage. Horizontal scalability experiments were performed to benchmark the overall performance of the architecture with increasing load. The results of the experiments indicate that stable response times and some degree of variability are attainable due to multiple middleware servers when browsing and/or searching a collection of a fixed size. There is minimal variation in response times when varying collection sizes and equally after the caching phases. Most importantly, request sequencing proved that the quantity and age of requests have no impact on response times. The experimental results thus provide evidence to support the feasibility of building and deploying cloud-based Digital Libraries.},

abstract = {The number of worldwide e-Government users is growing significantly and their expectations for improved services are continuously increasing. The Internet has become a crucial tool to disseminate information to citizens, however poorly designed websites can drive a wedge between a government and its citizens. Research has shown that the poor usability of government websites is problematic in several countries. Problems experienced with website usability can prevent people from accessing and adopting technology, such as e-Government. A deep understanding of the users' needs is crucial for building a successful digital service. User research can be used to understand how people live their lives, in order to more effectively respond to user needs with informed and inspired design solutions. The focus of this paper is on user research conducted in rural areas to inform the design of a Government website. Focus groups and one-on-one interviews were conducted at Cape Access e-Centres in the Western Cape. This paper illustrates the method used to conduct the user research and explains the results of the study. Results provided insights on the use of smartphones; multiple languages; accessibility; the identification and need for e-services; services required at the e-Centres and services and information required on the website. This was the first user research conducted in rural areas to inform website design in the Western Cape Government.},

abstract = {Existing theories of Information Systems (IS) adoption and innovation often provide rationalistic explanations of user behaviour that abstract away from the realities of everyday life. Ciborra's hospitality metaphor is a useful theoretical lens to use in the study of IS adoption and innovation as it allows for the messy, emotive, real-world influences that shape users' reactions to the introduction of new technologies. The hospitality metaphor allows for ambiguous and contradictory reactions to new technologies which are conceptualised as 'ambiguous strangers', both enabling and constraining users. However, this paper argues that the metaphor needs to be extended to more explicitly incorporate 'mood' and the users' expectations of the technology prior to receipt in order to be more holistically applicable to the IS adoption and innovation context. This paper contributes to the literature by synthesising Ciborra's works on 'hospitality' and 'mood', and expanding the reach of his hospitality metaphor to incorporate initial and pre-receipt hostility as a user response.},

abstract = {The hype on the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) continues. At the same time, the failure of ICT for Development (ICT4D) projects is still on the rise. As with other drivers of development initiatives, the effectiveness of ICT as a tool for development will partly be determined by the national policies. Bad policies are likely to have a negative impact which may range from underdevelopment to wasteful spending. It is therefore in the interest of many stakeholders that the ICT policies should capture and shape the role of ICT in development in the correct way. As such, the main aim of this paper is to interrogate and probably uncover the interests of a policy in relation to development. This is particularly relevant for developing countries where ICT policies are known to fail and to lack relevance. To do this, this study uses Habermas's Theory of Communicative Action to analyse Swaziland's National ICT Policy in an attempt to understand its appreciation of development. Findings show that the policy conceptualises development as a form of modernism and economic advancement. The study also shows that the ICT policy has a distorted view of the role of ICT in development. It is hoped that the findings of the study will serve to inform policy-makers of potential blind-spots in their policy formulation.},

abstract = {Data recording and storage have evolved over the past decades from manual gathering of data by using simple writing materials to the automation of data collection. Data storage has evolved significantly in the past decades and today databases no longer suffice as the only medium for the storage and management of data. This is due to the emergence of the Big Data and Data Science concepts. Previous studies have indicated that the multiplication of processing power of computers and the availability of larger data storage at reduced cost are part of the catalysts for the volume and rate at which data is now made available and captured.In this paper, the concepts of Big Data, Data Science and Business Analytics are reviewed. This paper discusses datafication of different aspects of life as the fundamental concept behind the growth of Big Data and Data Science. A review of the characteristics and value of Big Data and Data Science suggests that these emerging concepts will bring a paradigm change to a number of areas. Big Data was described as the basis for Data Science and Business Analytics which are tools employed in Data Science. Because these fields are still developing, there are diverse opinions, especially on the definition of Data Science. This paper provides a revised definition of Data Science, based on the review of available literature and proposes a schematic representation of the concepts.},

The declarative nature of CMMN is intended to supplement the procedural perspective of BPMN. CMMN takes a data-centric view to process modeling based on business artifacts to provide flexibility for knowledge workers, while retaining the advantages of business process management (BPM) systems.As far as the researchers are aware, this research is among the first contributions to the understanding of CMMN's method complexity in the context of other process modeling notations. We used the meta-model-based method complexity approach introduced by Rossi and Brinkkemper to evaluate the method complexity of CMMN. The results were compared with other popular process methods, including BPMN, Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity diagrams, and Event-driven Process Charts (EPC), all of which have undergone similar evaluations by other researchers. The initial results indicated that CMMN 1.0 compares favorably with BPMN 1.2.},

abstract = {Achieving alignment between business and IT represents a desired but mostly unattainable goal for large organisations. While the adoption of vanilla ERP solutions offers a variety of advantages, organisations generally fail to align such artefacts with every aspect of their operations. An important symptom of such failure is that users of these systems experience task-technology misfit in the context of their day-to-day organisational work. In a limited number of studies IS (Information Systems) scholars have investigated users' behavioural responses to experiences of misfit. This study extends that line of research by investigating the adoption of reinvention practices by users as they attempt to cope with or overcome misfit. The paper reports the analysis of data collected through a survey involving 794 users as part of a cross-sectional, multi-method case study. Findings suggest that experiences of misfit trigger the adoption of reinvention practices which, while creating data-related risks, promote flexibility in an IS.},

abstract = {Community Health Workers (CHWs) are often the only link to healthcare for millions of people in the developing world. There is growing interest in supporting CHWs at the point-of-care through the application of mobile-health or mHealth platforms. Despite the promise of these technologies, there is a lack of substantive evidence regarding the impacts of mHealth tools on healthcare service delivery and whether these tools are adequately designed to fit with the intended healthcare service tasks, thereby enhancing CHW workflow efficiencies. To address this gap, the study aims to (i) determine a relevant set of dimensions along which to evaluate healthcare service task and mHealth tool characteristics, and (ii) use these dimensions to theorize and test a Task-Technology Fit model to predict mHealth tool use and CHW performance. Data was collected from 312 CHWs in the counties of Siaya, Nandi, and Kilifi, in Kenya using a survey instrument. Findings show that "fit' as the covariation between healthcare service task and mHealth tool characteristics will result in increased mHealth tool use and enhanced CHW performance in the Kenyan context. Results thus confirm that by providing adequate functional support for CHW needs, mHealth tools may represent the most effective and cost-effective way to ultimately save lives and improve healthcare outcomes in the developing world.},

abstract = {Development of cooperative behaviour for multi-robots system (MRS) is an important aspect of robotic task achievement. This is because it is safer to use more than one robot to achieve a task for continuity measurement of task completion and it is also quicker to complete a task on time with two or more robots as against one robot. Continuity measurement here means if one robot breaks down, the remaining robots can continue and complete the task. Inspection of environments such as underground tunnels, underwater and industrial pipes are harsh areas that need exploring and exploiting in field robotics. The focus of this research is on using MRS to achieve pre-entry safety inspection of roof cracks and level of toxic gases in the underground terrain with the paramount aim of saving the lives of the miners from disasters. This paper presents the model for performance evaluations in terms of scalability. The use of cooperative behaviour to address the issues of multi-robot learning is also presented. We discuss the cooperative MRS behaviour framework and then describe the results from simulations. The evaluation/scalability of the model using two robots, three robots and four robots are investigated. The results reveal that our model can guide two, three and up to four robots to achieve efficient cooperative inspection behaviour in underground terrains with minimal cost of time and memory. The model will also work very well with any number of robots so long as the environment is expanded.},

abstract = {Various reasons exist why certain types of information is deemed personal both by legislation and society. While crimes such as identity theft and impersonation have always been in existence, the rise of the internet and social media has exacerbated the problem. South Africa has recently joined the growing ranks of countries passing legislation to ensure the privacy of certain types of data. As is the case with most implemented security enforcement systems, most appointed privacy regulators operate in a reactive way. While this is a completely acceptable method of operation, it is not the most efficient. Research has shown that most data leaks containing personal information remains available for more than a month on average before being detected and reported. Quite often the data is discovered by a third party who selects to notify the responsible organisation but can just as easily copy the data and make use of it. This paper will display the potential benefit a privacy regulator can expect to see by implementing pro-active detection of electronic personally identifiable information (PII). Adopting pro-active detection of PII exposed on public networks can potentially contribute to a significant reduction in exposure time. The results discussed in this paper were obtained by means of experimentation on a custom created PII detection system.},

abstract = {Eye gaze can be used to gauge attention and potentially respond accordingly within the context of interactive advertising. In order to utilise gaze patterns effectively, a model may have to be developed which can interpret intentions based on prior knowledge of gaze behaviour. Gaze behaviour while viewing advertisements needs to be investigated fully before such a model can be built. This study contributes by examining eye behaviour of three groups of viewers while viewing themed advertisements or print media. Findings corroborate those of previous studies in that faces and eyes attract attention. There were marked differences in the way participants paid attention to text with senior participants spending more time on text than their junior counterparts. Additionally, the younger participants followed a typical F-pattern when reading some of the content. In general, the younger participants tended to emulate behaviour found during web browsing, which suggests that advertisements would migrate well to an interactive medium. Image-rich print media resulted in higher concentration on images only, with very little attention being paid to text elements. This observation was common to all participant groups. More in-depth studies are required in order to generate more concrete patterns for a variety of advertisements if a model were to be developed.},

A case study was conducted in the Mankosi Community in the Eastern Cape with the aim of designing and implementing a billing system for an existing community-owned telephony system, by accommodating the community's requirements. Relevant criteria had to be considered for this telephony system based on voice over Internet Protocol with the possibility of 'break-out' calls to external networks. Different payment modalities were explored that would allow for a transparent method of both collecting money and applying the collected funds to achieve the project's sustainability. A participative methodology with future users and operators of the network---using scenarios and prototypes to illustrate the implementation---informed the design of the billing system. Data was collected by means of unstructured interviews and focus group discussions. Qualitative data was analyzed using a qualitative content analysis tool. The community indicated that a billing system, based on both vouchers and prepaid service, would satisfy their needs.},

In addressing this question, we developed such a user-defined gesture set, based on gestures elicited from participants with little or no experience with touch screen devices. Focusing on 24 specific search-related browser functions, 20 participants were asked, in a lab setting, to experiment with and then suggest a gesture for each of the functions. Data collection included video and audio recordings, think-aloud data, informal interviews and self-evaluation of proposed gestures. A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed the following: one-handed gestures are preferred over two-handed gestures; users who have mostly been exposed to mouse interaction prefer gestures that correspond to point-and-click actions; completion of a task should be possible with more than one gesture; and complex tasks should allow varying combinations of gestures).},

To this end, an online similarity survey was conducted with respondents ordering answer images in order of similarity to question images. Since all the survey images were generated with tree grammars, the most popular measure of tree similarity, the tree edit distance, was used to compare the images. This was done in order to determine how closely tree edit distance measures model perceptual similarity. Eight different types of tree edit distance measures were used in order to cover the broad range of tree edit distance and tree edit distance approximation methods. All the tree edit distance measures were then correlated with the online similarity survey results to determine which ones more closely model perceptual similarity. The results are then analysed in the light of some modern psychological theories of perceptual similarity.},

The theoretical modelling of waveforms or signals that flow through networks is valuable in a variety of scenarios including performance analysis and the design of communication systems.

The fundamental contribution of this work is the design of a traffic generating tool called MTGawn which is able to run on a mobile device. Design Science Research was the research methodology used for the design and deployment of a prototype of the proposed system. VoIP traffic was emulated using an implementation of well-known real time transport protocols such as RTP and cRTP, and parameterization was defined by using three codecs namely: G.711, G.723, and G.729. An evaluation was performed in a laboratory wireless network testbed and preliminary results were collected and analysed. The results of the experiments show that such a measuring instrument can be deployed on a mobile phone. More experiments are being done to ensure the accuracy of the data and also to compare the results with that of computer-based systems. Furthermore additional functionalities, similar to the functionality found on the computer-based open source tools, are being added to the mobile tool.},

abstract = {In scientific inquiry definitions serves the purpose of describing what something is in terms that are concise, precise and allows for clear communication. Since the start of the enterprise architecture (EA) research field the issue of the definition of terms and fundamental concepts has been continually debated. The ongoing debate is indicative of a lack of universal agreement on EA fundamentals amongst EA researchers and practitioners which, in turn, manifests as a gap in the literature with regard to the underlying fundamental concepts of EA. This paper reports on the results of an investigation into the description of EA's fundamental concepts. During the investigation a structured interpretation method was applied to two prominent enterprise architecture frameworks in order to produce a set of EA propositions that captured the fundamental meaning of EA as a concept. The investigation resulted in the 'EA claim' that EA is similar, in intent, to the enterprise as a worldview is to the world. The 'EA claim' and its supportive six EA propositions provide and explicit description of the foundational understanding of what EA is.},

abstract = {Building sophisticated computer players for games has been of interest since the advent of artificial intelligence research. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques have led to recent advances in the performance of computer players in a variety of games. Without any refinements, the commonly-used upper confidence bounds applied to trees (UCT) selection policy for MCTS performs poorly on games with high branching factors, because an inordinate amount of time is spent performing simulations from each sibling of a node before that node can be further investigated. Move-ordering heuristics are usually proposed to address this issue, but when the branching factor is large, it can be costly to order candidate actions. We propose a technique combining sampling from the action space with a na\"{\i}ve evaluation function for identifying nodes to add to the tree when using MCTS in cases where the branching factor is large. The approach is evaluated on a restricted version of the board game Risk with promising results.},

abstract = {Home-based work, also referred to as distance work, virtual work or Telework, is enabled by information and communication technologies, and has been in existence for over 35 years. Even with significant technological improvements, telework has not achieved widespread adoption. Of the many aspects of telework investigated, few studies have examined the effect of organisational features which can affect telework success. This research study examined the role of the organisation in telework adoption and explored the organisational factors that may positively or negatively influence telework diffusion. Telework success was approached as a multidimensional concept and the research draws from previous telework-related research to define a model based on a set of organisational factors, which were potentially able to affect telework adoption and diffusion. The model was tested by means of a dual case study of Information Systems (IS) personnel in two organisations. The comparative case study examined telework adoption in the organisations which were chosen as opposite polar types in order to examine the effect of the organisational factors in extreme opposites of telework maturity. An analysis of the case studies revealed that organisational factors are affected by the adoption process and values will change as telework practices mature. Additionally the relative contribution of each organisational factor was not equal and this changes over time so that the contribution of different factors will vary depending upon the maturity of telework practices in the organisation. Organisational factors that were not included in the original model but that should form part of future studies include national culture and the effect of industry type of the organization.},

abstract = {Reading is done by the coordinated execution of a number of processes, e.g. decoding, lexical access, assigning semantic roles and relating information across sentences.Visual inspection of raw gaze data was done to analyse the gaze behaviour of first (L1) and second language (L2) readers of Afrikaans text. Some of the known gaze behaviours in other languages were confirmed for L1 readers but it was found that L2 readers do not exhibit the typical gaze behaviours. L2 readers use more fixations than L1 readers to read the same text. Individual fixations of L2 readers are longer than that of L1 readers.It was also shown that the perceived difficulties of L2 readers are more pronounced with difficult texts than with easy texts. Specific examples are given that display the differences between easy and difficult reading pieces.},

abstract = {Mobile Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has taken the consumer market by storm and throughout the past two decades it has spilled into the corporate world. Since mobile ICT exists in complex technological, social and organisational environments, mobility deployments mostly remain piecemeal, existing as islands of independent technologies not leading to any business transformation.The purpose of this study is to develop a generic framework that guides organisations from the beginning to the end in achieving mobile transformation through the adoption of mobile ICT. Mobile transformation refers to the organisation's prudent deployment of mobile ICT to significantly modify its business strategy, strategic processes, operating procedures and organisational interfaces. This paper presents a compendium of opinions from market leaders in the mobile ICT field, it studies the methods proposed in academic journals and then develops an adoption approach for mobility. It illustrates and discusses those elements that are essential for planning and preparing to achieve business transformation through the use of mobility. The most important elements to consider are: implementing a top-down managerial planning approach; the relevant individual-organisational- and technological factors associated with mobility; taking appropriate measures to ensure that the organisation is ready for the adoption; determining an inclusive method of calculating the cost versus benefit calculation; and considering the practical issues of which security is the most pertinent. If implement correctly, mobility can lead the organisation into a plethora of benefits and completely transform the enterprise.},

abstract = {Malnutrition is one of the major health care problems in Africa, especially in young children. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the development of a mobile application to assist with malnutrition management for children under the age of five years. Malnutrition management refers to the collecting of patient data, patient diagnosis and treatment thereafter. A literature study revealed that there are existing applications that have been created to assist with health-related problems, but none of these address malnutrition management in South Africa. This study resulted in the identification of the shortcomings of existing applications and their positive aspects. These findings were incorporated into the design of a mobile application to support malnutrition management. A usability evaluation was conducted to determine the usability of the application. The user study revealed that the task success was above 66.7%, which indicated a good usability score. The user satisfaction was determined to be over 80%, which indicated that the participants were highly satisfied with the application. The results indicate that mobile computing can potentially be used to support the malnutrition management of children under the age of five in South Africa.},
