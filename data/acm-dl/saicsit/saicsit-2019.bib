abstract = {The paper presents a systematic literature review of the literature on the competencies that are essential to develop a globally competitive workforce in the field of data science. The systematic review covers a wide range of literature but focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on the computing, information systems, management, and organisation science literature. The paper uses a broad research search strategy covering four separate electronic databases. The search strategy led the researchers to scan 139 titles, abstracts and keywords. Sixty potentially relevant articles were identified, of which 42 met the quality criteria and contributed to the analysis. A critical appraisal checklist assessed the validity of each empirical study. The researchers grouped the findings under six broad competency themes: organisational, technical, analytical, ethical and regulatory, cognitive and social. Thematic analysis was used to develop a unified model of data science competency based on the evidence of the findings. This model will be applied to case studies and survey research in future studies. A unified data science competency model, supported by empirical evidence, is crucial in closing the skills gap, thereby improving the quality and competitiveness of the South Africa's data science workforce. Researchers are encouraged to contribute to the further conceptual development of data science competency.},

abstract = {Knowledge visualisation, in the field of information systems, is both a process and a product, and is informed by the closely aligned fields of information visualisation and knowledge management. Knowledge visualisation has untapped potential within the purview of knowledge communication. Even so, there is little evidence of knowledge visualisations being deployed. This might be due to a lack of evidence-based guidance to inform their creation. To improve this situation, we derived a number of "lenses" that can be used to reveal essential perspectives and feed into the visualisation production process.We propose a conceptual framework which incorporates these lenses to guide producers of knowledge visualisations. This framework uses the different lenses to reveal critical perspectives that need to be considered during the design process. We conclude by demonstrating how this framework could be used to produce a knowledge visualisation with maximum communicative power.},

abstract = {This paper presents methodological considerations for the enactment of hermeneutic phenomenology to excavate contextual practices from the experiences of tutors providing online support in an Open Distance Learning higher education institution in South Africa. The motivation behind the study was the need to understand the social-emotional and functional needs of participants in a community of practice and to add to the understanding of the social-emotional pressures emanating from the digital divide and participation inequality. To enact and particularise hermeneutic phenomenology for an online environment, the paper draws on User Experience concepts and qualitative dominant mixed research methods. The paper shows how data are drawn from virtual learning experiences that align academic goals and enrichment activities that support formal learning. To create the experience, the educational potential of social media was employed in a community of practice. The uniqueness of this contribution is the combination of phenomenology and theory on user experience. It is particularly useful and relevant for researchers interested in understanding the contextual realities of online and virtual learning communities. This study is yet unpublished, as it is part of a larger doctoral endeavor. As a result, this contribution put forward specific methodological considerations for excavating contextual practices from ODeL tutoring experiences},

abstract = {Mobile Health CrowdSensing (MHCS) is the use of sensor-based smart mobile devices to generate, collect, share and analyse real-time patient data from a population for improving health. The purpose of the paper is to report on a scoping review of research conducted on MHCS using a proposed classification framework. The framework has five categories of attributes (purpose; adoption and barriers; system attributes; software; and benefits and outcomes). Repositories searched were Medline/PubMed, Embase/Science Direct, PsycINFO, EBSCOHOST, IEEE, ACM Digital and accessible University library repositories from January 1998 to December 2018. Certain exclusion criteria were applied. 'Mobile crowd sensing' and 'mobile crowdsensing' keywords were separately used as search terms. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that MHCS applications in healthcare are scant. Most MHCS studies were from conference proceedings rather than traditional journals because of the fast-pace of technology-driven research. Healthcare research is costly and time-consuming thus there is a need to adopt MHCS as it can contribute towards low cost research due to the affordable devices used in generating, collecting and providing access to real-time data.},

A qualitative case approach using semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12 healthcare practitioners was used. Findings showed that healthcare practitioners face challenges during the implementation of HIT that affected their acceptance and adoption of the system. In addition, negative perceptions by some healthcare practitioners towards HIT was revealed. Lastly, there was ample perception of healthcare practitioners resisting HIT. This study highlights the significance of properly planning the HIT implementation by employers. There needs to be engagement and involvement of the key users of the HIT so that they take ownership and accept the system. This will significantly improve the chances for future HIT project implementations.},

abstract = {Mobile health applications are fast becoming an influential source of information for pregnant women. These technologies have been shown to help women monitor their progress during their pregnancy and personalise healthcare to suit their needs. Limited research has been directed towards understanding usage behaviours with these apps. Various authors have argued that there is a need to expand the scope of research from simple usage behaviour to deeper levels, as technology becomes more sophisticated and easily available. As such, this research explores post-adoption usage of mobile health pregnancy applications in the South African context based on Hsieh and Zmud's [1] post-adoption usage stages of acceptance, routinization and infusion. Open-ended semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve pregnant women. The findings revealed that pregnant women displayed post adoption routinization behaviours of routine use and IS continuance. With regards to infusion, the study found that pregnant women engaged in extended usage and deep usage. They did not engage in third stage behaviours, namely emergent use, feature extension or intention to explore. The research recognises m-health pregnancy support apps as important tools in the pregnancy journey. It highlights how pregnant women value these apps and view them as information sources and for reassurance during their pregnancy.},

This exploratory study is interpretive and qualitative in nature, as it relies on human perceptions and opinions. Two different questionnaires were used during the data-gathering process between the two participant groups (54 students and 24 parents). Thematic analysis was applied to identify emerging themes from the data. Students share a common interest and curiosity that increases the likelihood of them using the Dark Web. In contrast, parents have very little interest in and knowledge of the Dark Web. This lack of interest and knowledge causes parents to be ignorant and unconcerned about their children's potential use of the Dark Web. Our research indicates that young adolescents may use the Dark Web, not being fully aware of the dangers associated with it.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm with multitudes of design patterns. However, in order to use these patterns quickly and effectively, one must be able to make a differentiation between the existing patterns. At the moment, there is no known catalogue for the IoT patterns in which each pattern is described at a fine-grained level, i.e. in terms of its attributes. The need to discuss these patterns in terms of their attributes is important as it enables ease of understanding and allows us to group related patterns together for speedy retrieval. In this paper, we present an attributes extraction system which generates a list of attributes for a given IoT pattern. The attributes extraction system is based on identification and extraction of important sentences which describe the core properties of the given IoT pattern. The system uses multiple linguistics features to identify the most important sentences in a document with regard to describing the core essence of a given pattern. The system calculates an independent score for each sentence per feature. Through aggregation, the independent scores for each feature can then be combined to give a weighted mean score for each sentence. The evaluation results show that the attributes selected by the system are consistent with human ranking in the bulk of the examined documents.},

abstract = {Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are exposed to agile and dynamic environments where information and communication technologies (ICTs) change frequently. As such, SMEs need to be counter-agile in response to these changes. The ability of an SME to respond dynamically to agile business environments is called dynamic capabilities. This paper investigated the role that SME dynamic capabilities play in the evaluation of existing ICTs before making adoption decisions to switching to emerging ICTs. The study collected data from 222 SME owners across South Africa. The data collected were analysed quantitatively, using correlation and regression analysis. The results obtained suggest that SMEs in this study perceive that they have absorptive and innovative capabilities, but they do not possess innovative capabilities. While SMEs perceive themselves to demonstrate absorptive and adaptive capabilities, these capabilities do not influence their decision to switch to new emerging and enticing ICTs despite knowing of its existence. The findings suggests that South African SMEs do not consider new and emerging ICT as offering advantages. The findings also suggest that, instead of SME dynamic capabilities there might be other factors such as social, technical and economic or financial factors that might assist in the evaluation of existing ICTs. Future research should consider investigating these inferences.},

abstract = {This paper reports findings on how industry players frame Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) compliance in the South African Information Communication and Technology (ICT) sector. B-BBEE resembles Affirmative Action (AA) policies which have been implemented globally to redress historical inequalities. However, in South Africa, B-BBEE is not a narrow AA policy, but an instrumental domestic economic growth strategy. In the National Integrated ICT policy, B-BBEE is positioned as a driver for sectoral growth and an imperative for operating a business. Despite this reality, B-BBEE compliance has received little attention from Information Systems (IS) researchers. The study used framing both as an analytical tool and a sensitising theory to analyse 65 news articles to see how industry players frame B-BBEE compliance. The findings revealed that industry players framed B-BBEE compliance as ethical, competitive advantage, anti-economic growth, anti-FDI, minority discrimination and a complexity. The study also reveals interesting theory with regards to new public policy acceptance in technology-driven environment.},

abstract = {The existing landscape of research on the outcomes of information systems (IS) implementation suggests that this domain is extensively researched. Results indicate that most IS implementations fail, yet the uptake of these systems is still on the rise. This inconsistency might be because of how IS success and failure are assessed, defined and framed in research; hence, there is a need for the systematic and comprehensive characterisation of research in this domain. To achieve this, we adopt a machine learning technique called latent semantic analysis (LSA) to identify the major themes and topics on IS success and failure in literature. The turn to a machine learning technique is valid given the ever-increasing volume of textual data in research, and the inability of traditional research approaches to keep up with this growth. For this study, abstracts from 379 journal articles from EBSCOhost were fed into the LSA process as input and 37 themes were identified as output. These themes are discussed under five broad categories labelled: model/theory, user, information technology (IT) artefact, factors and context.},

As such, it requires clarity of purpose, which can be achieved through having a firm digital business strategy. However, few studies explain how the two processes of digital business strategizing and digital transformation interrelate. The aim of this study is to identify the core concepts that link digital business strategy to digital transformation so as to improve understanding of their dynamic interaction and outcomes. Through a systematic literature review, it was shown that the fundamental concepts in the domain of study are digital technologies, digital business strategy, digital transformation strategy, digital transformation, digital leadership, business models, digital innovation, digital transparency and digital maturity. The key link between digital business strategy and digital transformation is a digital transformation strategy. A model is developed which shows the interrelationship of all these concepts.},

abstract = {Age and gender estimation plays a fundamental role in intelligent applications such as access control, marketing intelligence, human-computer interaction etc. The advent of deep architectures have paved a way to improve the performance of estimation models, however, there is still a lack of optimized architectures. This paper focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks, and parameter modeling and optimization, and their effect on accuracy and loss term convergence. This paper first makes use of a generalized deep architecture based on literature and looks at ways of optimizing and reducing complexity without loss of accuracy. Different activation functions such as rectified linear unit (ReLU), linear function, exponential linear unit (ELU), hyperbolic tangent and Googles' proposed Swish function were tested along with the use of additional convolutional and fully-connected layers. Experiments resulted in a less complex architecture for gender classification and results were in line with that of benchmark accuracies found in literature, however, the same couldn't be achieved for age estimation. The inability to find a simpler architecture for age estimation is attributed to the complex nature of features that are associated with age than that of gender and also the multi-class classification nature of the age estimation problem.},

abstract = {Image segmentation mask creation relies on objects having distinct edges. While this may be true for the objects seen in many image segmentation challenges, it is less so when approaching tasks such as segmentation of vegetation in aerial imagery. Such datasets contain indistinct edges, or areas of mixed information at edges, which introduces a level of annotator subjectivity at edge pixels. Existing loss functions apply equal learning ability to both these pixels of low and high annotation confidence. In this paper, we propose a weight map based loss function that takes into account low confidence in the annotation at edges of objects by down-weighting the contribution of these pixels to the overall loss. We examine different weight map designs to find the most optimal one when applied to a dataset of aerial imagery of vegetation, with the task of segmenting a particular genus of shrub from other land cover types. When compared to inverse class frequency weighted binary cross-entropy loss, we found that using weight map based loss produced a better performing model than binary cross-entropy loss, improving F1 score by 4%.},

However, their potential application in computer vision and machine learning has never been fully studied. The most successful feature descriptors for image classification use gradient images for extracting the overall shapes of objects, thus edge preserving filters could improve their quality. The effects of various edge-preserving filters were evaluated as a pre-processing step inhuman detection. In this work, three smoothing filters were tested, namely the total variation (TV), relative total variation (RTV) and L0 smoothing. Significant performance gains were realised with TV and RTV for both colour and thermal images while the L0 smoothing filter only realised a slight improvement on thermal images and poorer performance on colour images. These results show that smoothing filters have a potential to improve the robustness of common statistical learning classifiers.},

abstract = {Computer technology develops at an astounding pace, and new technologies are constantly being introduced. Microprocessor development boards, which are currently used in building and automation; three-dimensional printing; and hosting media centers, networks, and servers, may become an alternative to commodity personal computers.This paper focuses on the follow-up experiment in a larger study where the null-hypothesis - microprocessor development boards can support data processing of small-scale database management systems solutions on a similar scale as that of commodity personal computers - was rejected. To determine the degree to which microprocessor development boards can host small-scale database management systems solutions, three testing parameters per microprocessor development board are investigated, namely total average thread failures, the point of divergence, and the data volume accommodated before breakpoint is reached.From the tests, the breakpoint ratios among the microprocessor development boards are calculated to compare them to one another. Lastly, a price comparison is made - to show how the microprocessor development board pricing compares to that of a commodity personal computer.},

abstract = {In radio astronomy, radio frequency interference (RFI) refers to any signal captured by a radio telescope that did not originate from the observed target in the sky. As RFI corrupts observational data and may even damage radio telescope equipment, astronomers seek to store data on RFI, with the aim of mitigating or preventing future interference events. This is a concern for the MeerKAT telescope, precursor to the Square Kilometer Array and one of the largest and most sensitive radio telescope in the world to date. Currently, RFI data at MeerKAT is collected in many different file formats that do not fit into traditional database models created to store data in a fixed schema. Therefore, we have designed a scalable database model for RFI storage, that supports many databases and many data models. The database is deployed in a Dockerized environment. Preliminary testing of our design shows linearly scaling of data ingestion as data sizes increases, as well as fast query processing.},

abstract = {Network telescopes have been used for over a decade to aid in identifying threats by gathering unsolicited network traffic. This Internet Background Radiation (IBR) data has proved to be a significant source of intelligence in combating emerging threats on the Internet at large. Traditionally, operation has required a significant contiguous block of IP addresses. Continued operation of such sensors by researchers and adoption by organisations as part of its operation intelligence is becoming a challenge due to the global shortage of IPv4 addresses. The pressure is on to use allocated IP addresses for operational purposes. Future use of IBR collection methods is likely to be limited to smaller IP address pools, which may not be contiguous. This paper offers a first step towards evaluating the feasibility of such small sensors. An evaluation is conducted of the random sampling of various subnet sized equivalents. The accuracy of observable data is compared against a traditional 'small' IPv4 network telescope using a /24 net-block. Results show that for much of the IBR data, sensors consisting of smaller, non-contiguous blocks of addresses are able to achieve high accuracy rates vs. the base case. While the results obtained given the current nature of IBR, it proves the viability for organisations to utilise free IP addresses within their networks for IBR collection and ultimately the production of Threat intelligence.},

abstract = {The electronic health record (EHR) has revolutionised the manner in which healthcare is delivered by providing clinicians with electronic access to patients' complete medical history. Countries such as South Africa aim to take advantage of the EHR by implementing a national EHR system. While this has a number of benefits that are in the best interests of the patient, it also creates security and privacy risks to patients' information. Patient information has been identified as the most sensitive type of personal information. Unlike other types of personal information, it contains confidential information about the patient that cannot be changed such as the patient's medical history. Thus, the EHR needs to be protected from both unauthorised entities and misuse by authorised clinicians. This can be achieved through the regulation of the national EHR system. Although regulations state that personal information must be protected, they do not specify what processes must be followed in order to comply with them. This paper proposes a model to address this problem by indicating the components that are needed in order to assist compliance. The proposed model, which was informed by a scoping review and thematic analysis, is discussed in the context of South Africa's future national EHR system with the focus on the Protection of Personal Information (PoPI) Act.},

In this study we characterize this problem by looking at a cohort of South African students. We employ a web-based survey of 100 students, supplemented by in-depth interviews with 10 additional students. In both cases we inquired about, and observed knowledge of permissions, encryption and application installation practices. Our findings show that most students (80%) do not look for or understand permissions or encryption, and use location-based services unsafely. Based on these results we argue that digital natives lack the technical skills and understanding to properly engage with mobile privacy and security. We further argue that this generation has been so over-exposed to mobile requests that violate their privacy and security that they have become desensitized and their definition of privacy and security has changed. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for higher education institutions, policy, and mobile application design.},

abstract = {The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and internet-connected devices introduces the potential of providing intelligence to a wide range of applications. The smart home is a popular application of IoT. Smart homes are perceived as a promising solution for providing support to inhabitants in completing daily activities, prolonging independence and enhancing quality of life. Access to sensor datasets is essential for smart home research. For example, activity recognition research requires sensor datasets to assess the performance of activity recognition models and algorithms. There are several limitations that can prevent researchers from acquiring sensor datasets, such as cost, time, and inflexibility of smart homes. The limitations also extend to both the limited quality and quantity of existing sensor datasets. Smart home simulation is identified as a potential solution to mitigate these limitations. This paper proposes Smart Environment Simulation (SESim), a simulation tool that supports smart home simulation for generating synthetic sensor datasets. The paper discusses the design, implementation, and validation of SESim. SESim was validated by conducting three phases of validation. The first validation phase validated the utility of SESim by addressing several use-cases of smart home simulation. The second validation phase validated the utility of sensor datasets generated using SESim by conducting an experiment. The experiment involved the generation of synthetic sensor datasets using SESim, training of an activity recognition model using the generated sensor datasets, and the evaluation of the activity recognition model using the generated sensor datasets. The third validation phase assessed and validated the extensibility of the SESim tool by conducting an interview with an expert user who extended the functionality of SESim.},

In this paper we investigate the performance of word embedding techniques on two under-resourced languages. We investigate two topic models, LDA and DMM as well as a word embedding word2vec. We find DMM to perform better than LDA as a topic model embedding. DMM and word2vec perform similar in a semantic evaluation task of aligned corpora.},

The research objective was to gather scientific evidence by conducting a quantitative experiment with constructivist digital assistive technology and qualitative interviews with the teachers involved. The findings from the experiment suggest that the constructivist digital assistive technology may have had a positive effect on the mathematics achievement of the learners, which was supported by the findings from the interviews. This makes an original contribution to the domain and offers an intervention that was feasible, practical and potentially effective for improving the teaching and learning of mathematics for deaf learners.},

Our findings suggest that, while most students perceive themselves to be well informed about automation, and generally believe that machines will displace human labour, they do not consider their own future occupations to be susceptible to automation. Accordingly, few students consider automation as a factor when making career decisions.},

This paper examines and reports on the average time taken by groups of students with and without disabilities to complete certain tasks, using the University of South Africa (Unisa) website and myUnisa, the e-learning website of Unisa. The people for whom a website is intended, in this case, students with disabilities, have to be involved in the development of the websites, that is the e-learning websites. In this qualitative study, quantitative data analysis is used to support qualitative data analysis. The findings of this study show that groups of participants or students with disabilities are having problems working on this e-learning website. The study endorses that well-developed e-learning platforms must be efficiently, effectively and satisfactorily used by all students, including those with disabilities. The study recommends that it is significant for all the applicable stakeholders to be part of the development of websites to guarantee that accessibility and usability are appropriately adhered to. The intention is to reduce marginalisation, as well as digital and social divides of students with disabilities.

Based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), an explanatory research approach was followed with the objective of determining the influence of the TPB elements namely attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on IT workers' intention to adopt telework. The model was tested quantitatively by means of online survey, for which a total of 120 valid responses were received. The results showed that attitude and subjective norms did not significantly influence IT workers' intention to telework. Instead, perceived behavioral control of IT workers was found significant, which was determined by the availability and cost of the technology, the level of support from employers and the self-efficacy of IT workers. The cost of bandwidth was found a major inhibitors of telework amongst local IT workers. Therefore, addressing the technology and support challenges could improve the self-efficacy of workers with regards to working remotely. Employers should provide financial support to subsidize the high cost of bandwidth in South Africa. This study provides new insights regarding the status of IT workers' adoption of telework in South Africa, thereby contributing to policy and research practice.},

abstract = {Privacy as a human right has been in existence for decades, but its effects are accentuated in the information age. Data privacy compliance in modern information technology applications is important, unavoidable, but complex, even more so for technologies (such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and Internet of Things (IoT)) that are enablers of the fourth industrial revolution, because of the covert nature of data collection involved. Organisations are not always equipped to comply with privacy requirements in such environments. This paper proposes a list of privacy compliance guidelines aimed at making it practical for organisations to comply with privacy legislation in these domains. The proposed guidelines can provide direction to organisations when carrying out a data privacy compliance exercise for CPSs and IoT. The guidelines take into account technical, organisational and legal aspects of data privacy compliance. Legal aspects are primarily based on the South African Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013. Design science research, using literature analysis and expert opinion as data collection methods, was used as research approach.},

abstract = {Virtual Call centers are increasingly becoming a new trend amongst organizations. However, this is not the case for most developing countries. This study explores the virtual call center phenomenon as a new innovation amongst organizations in the Western cape of South Africa. The purpose is to examine the factors that influence adoption, specifically the lack of adoption of virtual call center. The study follows a qualitative approach and in-depth interviews were conducted with five organizations within the call center industry. The findings show that the virtual call center is still perceived as a new innovation that is yet to be successfully implemented due to, among other factors, the lack of trialiability and observability within the industry; technology readiness and data security concerns; organizational culture and the socio economic status of employees. The study has both managerial and policy implications.},

abstract = {There is a need for new inventive strategies to communicate to the public on particular subjects such as climate change, biodiversity loss and sustainability. Social Media Influencers (SMIs) are an emerging type of third-party endorsers who can aim to shape and influence the attitudes and perceptions of people through social media. In the field of marketing, SMIs have had great impact on customer retention and relationships. SMIs could help in engaging with the public to adopt pro-environmental behaviour. However, there is limited research related to SMIs in the field of environmental awareness. This study reports on a grounded theory analysis that explored the literature related to the characteristics of SMIs and the techniques used by SMIs that could be used by researchers for influencing the public regarding environmental awareness and pro-environmental behaviour. This paper fulfils a need for identifying strategies for engaging and influencing the public to gain insights into their pro-environmental behaviour.},

abstract = {In response to calls for IS researchers to investigate how digital natives are using information and communication technologies to shape their interpersonal interactions, an exploratory, survey-based study was conducted to investigate patterns of online social behaviour on two popular SNSs (Facebook and Instagram) and, on this basis, compare their online and offline social behaviour. To capture online social behaviour a novel typology involving three high-level interactions --- producing, consuming, and reacting--- was proposed. The investigation found that, among digital natives, Instagram is used more frequently than Facebook, with consumptive behaviour on Instagram occurring most frequently, and productive behaviour on Facebook occurring least frequently. While online social behaviour was found to positively relate to offline socialisation, personality traits were found to account for a larger proportion of the variance in offline social behaviour than online actions. The findings are of particular relevance to those seeking to understand associations between behaviour online and behaviour offline. Moreover, the typology introduced is likely to be useful in a variety of contexts.},
