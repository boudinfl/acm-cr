Despite this, it's classification remains vague and detection systems in current Network Intrusion Detection Systems are incapable of detecting many forms of scanning traffic.This paper presents a classification of network scanning and illustrates how complex and varied this activity is. The presented classification extends previous, well known, definitions of scanning traffic in a manner which reflects this complexity.},

abstract = {Strategic information systems planning (SISP) is a key issue to IS managers. The SISP approach employed by organizations is very much dependent on the internal and external environment. Recent research points to a gap between the manner in which IS researchers and practitioners perceive SISP. In this paper we aim to elucidate this gap by comparing the way in which researchers and practitioners view the external environment and its impact on SISP. The researcher perspective was established through literature review. For the practitioner view, data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with 7 IS professionals who had experience of SISP. The interview data was analysed using techniques borrowed from the grounded theory methodology. Through this analysis it was found that practitioners, while recognizing the impact of the general external environment on SISP, are especially cognisant of the external IT environment and its impact. Academic literature, on the other hand, tends to focus on the external business environment, with very little research conducted on the external IT environment in the context of SISP. The implications of these and other findings are discussed in the paper.},

The study confirmed the need for systematic software reuse and identified the reuse issues that could present challenges. The study also revealed a number of problems relating to the project-centric structure for which systematic reuse provides potential solutions.},

abstract = {Ant-like agents forage between two points. These agents' probabilistic movements are based on the use of two pheromones; one marking trails towards the goal and another marking trails back to the starting point. Path selection decisions are influenced by the relative levels of attractive and repulsive pheromone in each agent's local environment. Our work in [5] evaluates three pheromone perception strategies, investigating path formation speed, quality, directionality, robustness and adaptability under different parameter settings(degree of randomness, pheromone evaporation rate and pheromone diffusion rate). We re-evaluate two of these strategies in terms of the amount of information they provide using Shannon's formulation [3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17]. We determine information as the difference between uncertainty before and after path selection decisions. Our focus in this paper is on investigating relationships between the emergence of the shortest path and the amount of stigmergic information that exists in the form of pheromone. Agents are deployed centrally and emergence measures are determined using the worst, reference and best cases observed in [5]. Additionally, the amount of local and global information that is available to agents in each movement step is evaluated. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation coefficients between measures of emergence and the amount of information are calculated. The significance of these correlation coefficients is tested using a 2 tailed test at 1% level of significance. Consequently the relationship between the amount of information and emergent behaviour is established. Significant relationships between information and the emergence of the shortest path exist when strong emergent behaviour is present.},

This virtual world is created with the participation of the children using the living labs approach. Children interact with the physical world in the form of a SINGA laboratory which emulates the proposed digital environment in order to gauge their opinions and attitudes towards the modelling of a SINGA virtual world. For effective empowerment of children the digital platform should be in the form of an interactive game that offers well-developed challenges to impart lessons that relate to the children's environment. The platform should be accessible via multiple media elements that children are familiar with. The platform should take into account the self-supporting structures that are in place for the child in the absence of adult care in order to understand key life events.},

abstract = {Designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is an arduous task that requires both functional and aesthetic considerations, often relying on documented style guides and design principles. Style guides and principles are mostly prescriptive in terms of what should be included and what should be avoided in interface design, but do not specify the how of the interface design process. Previous research has employed Genetic Algorithms to assist in the design process, but focused more on evolving colour schemes and ordering of user interface (UI) components than on the general layout of the interface. Components were essentially placed in a static grid which resulted in unappealing interfaces. This research seeks to evolve the placement of components on the screen through the use of layout managers. A user guides the evolution process by iteratively selecting promising interfaces from a collection of candidate interfaces. Various constraints are placed on the grouping of components to prevent inappropriate groupings in the UI layout and to reduce the number of selections that the designer has to make. Each candidate UI is encoded in a tree which made crossover operations inappropriate. This resulted in an Evolutionary Programming algorithm being used rather than a Genetic Algorithm. Various mutation operators are discussed. Through this evolutionary process, aesthetically pleasing and functional interfaces can then be created in a reasonable number of iterations.},

Agile methodologies (AM) have emerged to challenge traditional SD and overcome their limitations. Yet empirical research into AM is sparse. This paper develops and tests a research model that hypothesizes the effects of five characteristics of agile systems development (iterative development; continuous integration; test-driven design; feedback; and collective ownership) on two dependent stakeholder satisfaction measures, namely stakeholder satisfaction with the development process and with the development outcome. An empirical study of 59 South African development projects (using self reported data) provided support for all hypothesized relationships and generally supports the efficacy of AM. Iteration and integration together with collective ownership have the strongest effects on the dependent satisfaction measures.},

abstract = {One of the most prominent problems that persons with disabilities face in South Africa, is access to relevant disability related information. To address this need the South African National Accessibility Portal (NAP Portal) was developed, that enable people with disabilities to easily get access to information. However, most people in South Africa do not have access to adequate Internet facilities. To overcome this obstacle, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) engine was connected to the NAP Portal, which allows access to information through a telephony interface. The IVR engine and scripts guide the user through information categories on the portal to the desired information, which is then voiced out to the user. In this paper, we present the evaluation of the IVR system to determine how easy or difficult users experience the whole process of retrieving information via a telephone. A usability evaluation was performed on the current NAP IVR system. Furthermore, a heuristic evaluation was done on a new design of the NAP IVR system to determine whether the major problems, that were highlighted by an expert, are addressed in the new design. Inputs from both of these evaluations will be used to design the next version of the NAP IVR system.},

abstract = {High-performance computing systems are important in scientific computing. Clusters of computer systems --- which range greatly in size --- are a common architecture for high-performance computing. Small, dedicated clusters are affordable and cost-effective, but may not be powerful enough for real applications. Larger dedicated systems are expensive in absolute terms and may be inefficient because many individual groups may not be able to provide sustained workload for the cluster. Shared systems are cost-effective, but then availability and access become a problem.An alternative model is that of a virtual cluste, as exemplified by Amazon's Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2). This provides customers with storage and CPU power on an ondemand basis, and allows a researcher to dynamically build their own, dedicated cluster of computers when they need it. Used by commercial web services deployers, this technology can be used in scientific computing applications. This paper presents a case study of the use of EC2 for scientific computing. The case study concludes that EC2 provides a feasible, cost-effective model in many application areas.},

This algorithm calculates a percentage ranking reflecting the extent to which a POI matches the user's preferences, enabling partially-satisfied search results to be displayed. POInter enables users to identify POIs most suited to their needs and constraints and visualise the search results using a map-based metaphor. POInter combines positive features from existing systems, whilst addressing their limitations and introducing additional functionality.

ProB uses a constraint logic programming environment to perform model checking. NuSMV is the other model checker used in this work. It is an extension of SMV and makes use of symbolic model checking techniques to deal with the state explosion problem common to model checking in general. The problem is represented using Binary Decision Diagrams and model checking is performed using tableaux theorem proving techniques. The scope of the problems chosen is currently limited but it is envisaged that the methodology proposed could usefully be extended to larger planning problems.},

A project is currently underway in Dwesa to develop an E-Commerce platform that will 'connect' the residents with the necessary access to services and markets by providing them with the necessary tools in order to help in alleviating some of their challenges. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate existing requirements elicitation techniques and methodologies in the context of rural information technology implementations. The primary objective is to develop a model for user requirements elicitation in Dwesa. Many requirements elicitation techniques and frameworks exist, but few have been evaluated in the context of rural software implementations. Furthermore, requirements elicitation techniques should not be applied simply as steps to gather information. Instead this paper proposes a model that can be applied to assimilate the contribution of knowledge regarding the stakeholders, problem and solution characteristics, and other characteristics into the software development process for the effective elicitation of requirements.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of mobile devices has created a substantial market for mobile applications and games that continues to grow extremely rapidly. Consequently, the mobile game industry has firmly asserted itself as a significant industry with major development houses. In order to achieve a maximum target audience reach, it is crucial for developers to target the right mobile platforms and development environments. Simultaneously, the right tools are required to ensure the rapid, efficient creation and deployment of these mobile games. This paper offers an analysis and comparison of the well-established Java Micro Edition (JME) and the emerging Adobe Flash Lite platforms, based on our experiences developing a mobile phone game. An arcade-style game was developed that allowed key features to be tested using the JME and Flash Lite development platforms. The game adopted a tile-based, top-down perspective common to arcade games that are created using a tile-based game engine. The results obtained showed the strengths and weaknesses of the two environments, enabling optimal trade-offs to be made when developing mobile phone games. Our conclusion is that although it is possible to create tile-based games in both environments, JME currently provides better support, especially in the areas of collision detection and multi-threading.},

The purpose of this investigation was to establish the alternative approaches employed, and the extent to which each was used. To achieve this purpose, a comprehensive review of IS studies that employed "grounded theory" was carried out. Articles from the commonly ranked top 50 IS-centric journals were used as the frame of reference. These journals most closely represent the status quo in IS research. Articles for the period 1985 to 2007 were examined. The analysis revealed four main grounded theory approaches in IS research. These can be classified as the "Glaserian" grounded theory approach, the "Straussian" grounded theory approach, the use of "grounded theory" as part of a mixed methodology, and the simple application of grounded theory techniques, typically for data analysis purposes. The latter has been the most common application of "grounded theory" in IS research. The "Glaserian" approach was the least often employed, with many studies opting for the "Straussian" approach. These and other findings are discussed and implications drawn.},

abstract = {Open source software (OSS) is increasingly becoming an alternative for proprietary software (PS), particularly in the government sector globally. The adoption and implementation of OSS by the government sector is cited as one of the enablers for the adoption of OSS by the private sector. It is also apparent that in the government sector internationally, OSS is seen as a viable technology for reasons such as lowering software costs, growing local software development industry, and bridging the digital divide. In South Africa (SA), an OSS policy that mandates OSS usage within ministries is in place. But according to various open source advocates, little has happened with regards to OSS implementation in the SA government. This paper reports on the current status of OSS usage within the SA government by surveying forty (40) national departments, targeting Information Technology (IT) directors and managers. The results indicate that OSS usage within the ministries is not yet extensive as required by the OSS policy. Various challenges and obstacles are hampering full OSS implementation within the ministries. The contribution of this research paper is an OSS expansion model, which is proposed as a possible solution to improve the current status of OSS usage within the SA government departments. The model proposed is in line with SA government's implementation strategy as outlined in the OSS policy.},

Today, with the emergence of new sensors and improved processing hardware, a relatively inexpensive personal computer can process and store video in real-time, which fundamentally enables our research. Automated visual surveillance is poised to be a key technology in the fight against crime, particularly in monitoring security sensitive areas. A significant advantage of this technology lies in its non-intrusive nature in multi-target tracking. In this paper, we present an automated attention mechanism that allows for the operation of vision-based surveillance systems in a wide variety of environments typical of general indoor/outdoor settings. Different applications of our system are demonstrated including real-time abandoned luggage detection and general outdoor person/vehicle classification.},

E-commerce businesses are creating, maintaining and utilising customer profiles to assist in personalisation. Personalisation can help improve customers' satisfaction levels, purchasing behaviour, loyalty and subsequently improve sales. The continuously changing customer needs and preferences pose a challenge to e-commerce businesses on how to maintain and update individual customer profiles to reflect any changes in customers' needs and preferences.This research set out to investigate how a dynamic customer profile for on-line customers can be updated and maintained, taking into consideration individual web visitors' activities. The research designed and implemented a decision model that analysed on-line customers' activities during interaction sessions and determined whether to update customers' profiles or not. Evaluation results indicated that the model was able to analyse the on-line customers' activities from a log file and successfully updated the customers' profiles, based on the customer activities undertaken during the interaction session.},

More recently research has been directed at developing hyper-heuristic systems for timetable construction. Hyper-heuristic systems are used to decide which examination to schedule next during the timetable construction process and aim at allocating those examinations that are most difficult to schedule first. This study investigates using a genetic programming based hyper-heuristic system to evolve heuristic combinations for the uncapacitated examination timetabling problem. More specifically it presents and evaluates three different representations for heuristic combinations in a genetic programming system. The performance of the genetic programming based system using the different representations is applied to three examination timetabling problems with different characteristics and the performance on these problems is compared. The results obtained are also compared to that of other hyper-heuristic systems applied to the same problems.},

However, a majority of these studies focus on solving the problem for a particular school and there is very little research into the comparison of the performance of different techniques in solving the school timetabling problem.The study presented in this paper evaluates genetic algorithms (GAs) for the purpose of inducing school timetables. For each problem, the GA implemented iteratively refines an initial population of school timetables using mutation to find a good quality feasible timetable. The performance of the GA on a set of five benchmark problems has been compared to the performance of neural networks, simulated annealing, Tabu search, and greedy search on the same set of problems. The results obtained by the GA were found to be comparable to and an improvement on those produced by the other methods.},

Clients would rather speak to a contact centre agent than navigate through the menu structure found in these systems. Contact centres, due to a variety of reasons, most notably high personnel costs, tend to utilise IVR as their solution for automation. IVR is an example of a simple forward chaining rule based expert system. An evaluation was conducted to determine whether a natural language interface would provide a more effective automation technique in comparison to current techniques utilised by contact centres. This evaluation compared the advantages and disadvantages of a natural language interface and a rule based expert system interface (modelled to resemble an IVR) and concluded that a hybrid system utilising a combination of these techniques would provide a better solution. This paper discusses two models that could be employed in the combination of a rule based expert system with a natural language interface.},

abstract = {Technology adoption has been studied from a variety of perspectives. Information systems, Sociology and Human-Computer Interaction researchers have come up with various models incorporating factors and phases to predict adoption that, in turn, will lead to persistent use. Technology acceptance by the elderly mobile phone user has received less attention and no model currently exists to predict factors influencing their technology adoption. A literature study yielded a set of acceptance factors (derived mostly from quantitative studies) and adoption phases (derived mostly from qualitative studies) that could influence and predict mobile phone adoption by the elderly user. We confirmed a subset of these factors by consulting findings from research into the context of senior mobile phone users, including the needs and limitations of these users. We then verified the factors qualitatively by means of structured interviews with senior mobile phone users. The interviews included the use of scenarios as well as a mobile phone design activity. Triangulating the quantitative findings from literature with the qualitative findings from this study led to a set of interlinked acceptance factors and adoption phases that we present as the Senior Technology Acceptance&amp; Adoption model for Mobile technology (STAM). This paper makes a contribution to understanding technology acceptance by senior users and should be of interest to researchers, designers and decision-makers on technology adoption, especially mobile features and services.},

The current diversity of mobile phones come with an equally diverse array of text entry hardware (e.g. keypads, scroll wheels etc) and supporting algorithms (e.g. T9 [24]). The Nokia 7380 mobile phone has abandoned the traditional 12-button keypad for that of a scroll wheel via which all text entry is required. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a diminished text entry speed when compared to traditional keypad text entry methods. This study aims to investigate the viability of using a scroll wheel interfaced mobile phone with a new predictive text entry algorithm to improve text entry speeds and accuracy with the device. Investigations were conducted via simulations and it was found that the new algorithm gave a 50% increase in text entry speed when compared to the existing text entry method on this device.},

This paper finds that the context of design inscribed into e-Government systems in both explicit and implicit ways can produce a mismatch with the context in which it is used. This creates a contextual impact that can often lead to e-Government failure. Several studies exploring factors including national cultures of information and communication technology adoption have been conducted.

Using Hofstede's cultural model of cultural difference, this research conducted an analysis of a sample of the South African population to determine their culture context and their Web usage versus Government Web site usage preferences. The findings indicate to what extent culture context should be considered when designing the South African Government Web site.},

A model is presented which incorporates an adaptive user interface into the design of MMV systems. A prototype MMV system, called MediaMaps, is then described, demonstrating the successful implementation of this model. The results of an evaluation of MediaMaps are then presented, showing its effectiveness in supporting user needs and requirements for MMV using an adaptive user interface.},

These libraries provide gaze data interfaces, but not any of the additional infrastructure that is common to the implementation of such techniques. This results in an unnecessary duplication of effort. In this paper, a framework for implementing gaze selection techniques is presented. It consists of two components: a gaze library to interface with the tracker and a set of classes which can be extended to implement different gaze selection techniques. The framework is tracker and operating system independent, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of systems. Support for user testing is also built into the system, enabling researchers to automate the presentation of test targets to users and record relevant test data. These features greatly simplify the process of implementing and evaluating new interaction techniques. The practicality and flexibility of the framework are demonstrated by the successful implementation of a number of gaze selection techniques.},

abstract = {The usability of any tool or system has to be viewed in terms of the context in which it is used, and its appropriateness to that context. According to the ISO definition of usability, the context of use includes the users, tasks, equipment (hardware, software and materials), and the physical and social environments in which a product is used. Context analysis provides a framework to ensure that all factors which may affect the usability of a product are considered.Safety in the South African mining industry is a vital issue. On average, one worker dies every working day, and about 16 are injured in mine-related accidents. Inadequate or insufficient training is often cited as a root cause for many mining fatalities. However, training outside the direct working environment provides only limited real-life opportunities and may fail to make a significant impact within the tense working environment itself. Virtual reality-based training tools can, by contrast, provide simulated exposure to real-world working conditions without the associated risks.This paper discusses contextual analysis for virtual reality (VR) application development, applied to safety training in mines. This contextual analysis has been conducted to contribute to the usability of future system design. It also provides a basis for designing subsequent usability evaluations. The results of the context analysis were applied to the design of a prototype, which was used and evaluated at two large platinum mines.},

Pedagogical program development environments have been created to assist novice programmers in the process of learning to program. An empirical experiment was conducted to compare a representative professional program development environment with a representative pedagogical program development environment to determine how novice programmers are affected by the program development environment utilised.
