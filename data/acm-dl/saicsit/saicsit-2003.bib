abstract = {This research focuses on existing project management structured methods and practices for improving the design, implementation and success of projects, with a view to uncovering methodologies suited to address the particular needs and problems of IT project management. After identifying the Balanced Scorecard as a possible methodology, the research then develops a management model based on the Project Management Body of Knowledge. A web-based questionnaire, designed to measure the internal management of an IS project, was completed by IS project managers in the Western Cape. The results of this analysis highlighted a positive link between the degree of balance in project management based on the model and the overall level of success.},

abstract = {A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) involves finding values, selected from a finite domain, for all variables such that all constraints on the variables are satisfied. A constraint satisfaction optimisation problem (CSOP) is a CSP that has some objective function defined in terms of some or all of the variables. We present an algorithm where we employ local consistency techniques in a pre-processing phase, in order to decrease the domain sizes of the variables. This results in a simplified CSOP to be solved by an existing algorithm.Partial constraint satisfaction involves finding values for all variables such that a maximal subset of the constraints is satisfied. We expand our pre-processing algorithm to the partial CSOP case.},

abstract = {Numerous software development projects do not live up to expectations or sadly fail. This can be seen in the fact that software projects often do not comply with the traditional standard measurements of success, namely time, cost and specifications. Traditionally, individual software projects were executed at a single location. However, due to globalisation and advances in computing technologies, this has changed, and software projects are developed and deployed in distributed and collaborative environments. This means that traditional project management methods cannot and do not address the added complexities found in a distributed environment, such as efficient task scheduling, tracking and monitoring, as well as effective sharing of information and knowledge among project contributors. High levels of collaboration, task interdependence and distribution have become essential across time, space and technology. In this paper the utilisation of stationary and mobile software agents is investigated as a potential tool to improve software project management processes. We also propose and discuss a software agent framework to support distributed software project management. Although still in its initial phases, this research shows promise of significant results in enabling software developers to meet market expectations, and produce projects timeously, within budget and to users' satisfaction.},

A preliminary survey of local organisations using Duffy's Knowledge Management Benchmarking Questionnaire confirms these findings, and a framework which will address the shortcomings in current knowledge management implementation strategies is proposed. An empirical study testing the validity of the framework is described, and the study concludes that the proposed framework has displayed its validity.},

address = {ZAF},
abstract = {Over the past eighteen months, there has been a renewed interest in mobile agent technology due to the continued exponential growth of Internet applications, the establishment of open standards for these applications, as well as the semantic web developments. However, the lack of a standardised programming model addressing all aspects of mobile agent systems prevents widespread deployment of the potentially useful technology. The architectural requirements dealing with all aspects of a mobile agent system are not clearly stipulated. As a result, the commercially available mobile agent systems and mobile agent tool kits address different mobile agent issues, and little reuse of available technologies and architectures takes place. The purpose of this paper is to describe an architectural model that identifies the components representing the essential aspects of a mobile agent system. Due to the intensive nature of development, implementation and testing of this model, we describe preliminary work. However, in the meanwhile, there are benefits associated with this preliminary model, namely that it provides a clear understanding of the architectural issues of mobile agent computing, giving novice researchers and practitioners who enters the field for the first time a foundation for making sensible decisions when researching, designing and developing mobile agents. The model is also significant in that it provides a benchmark for researchers and developers to measure the capabilities of mobile agents created by commercially available tool kits.},

abstract = {In user interface engineering, scenarios are stories that capture information about users and their tasks, including the context of use. Scenarios are generally documented using natural languages in order to understand, validate and use them effectively and efficiently throughout the development lifecycle.

This paper discusses how use case maps, a visual notation for representing scenarios, with the complicity of formal requirements engineering methods, can lead to a comprehensive framework for representing and validating scenarios while improving and mediating the communication between usability engineers and software development teams. Particular attention is given to the extended use case maps as well as to a number of heuristics for formal validation.},

Concept mapping and standard hyperlinks were offered as choices for information retrieval interfaces. The methods employed were to identify a set of culturally divisive factors, and then to test two different interfaces with a group of culturally diverse, advanced learners. Some of the results had to be ignored due to small sample sizes. The remaining results indicated that most choices, almost irrespective of culture divisive factors, were made in favour of the concept mapping interface. This finding confirmed that of another author in the field. The primary conclusion reached is that concept mapping should be considered as the interface of choice to a knowledge repository to be used by Master's students in Information management.},

The structures which shaped and influenced the design of this IS (the restructured health services and social tradition) are explored and discussed. From this case study the implications of using IS design as a developmental tool are raised: namely the development of a shared understanding, the participation of key players and the agreement on joint action.},

abstract = {When a new discipline emerges it usually takes some time and lots of academic discussion before concepts and terms get standardised. Such a new discipline is text mining. In a groundbreaking paper, <i>Untangling text data mining</i>, Hearst [1999] tackled the problem of clarifying text-mining concepts and terminology. This essay aims to build on Hearst's ideas by pointing out some inconsistencies and suggesting an improved and extended categorisation of data- and text-mining techniques. The essay is a conceptual study. A short overview of the problems regarding text-mining concepts is given. This is followed by a summary and critical discussion of Hearst's attempt to clarify the terminology. The essence of text mining is found to be the discovery or creation of new knowledge from a collection of documents. The parameters of non-novel, semi-novel and novel investigation are used to differentiate between full-text information retrieval, standard text mining and intelligent text mining. The same parameters are also used to differentiate between related processes for numerical data and text metadata. These distinctions may be used as a road map in the evolving fields of data/information retrieval, knowledge discovery and the creation of new knowledge.},

abstract = {Information security management needs a paradigm shift in order to successfully protect information assets. Organisations must change to the holistic management of information security, requiring a well-established Information Security Management System (ISMS). An ISMS addresses all aspects in an organisation that deals with creating and maintaining a secure information environment. Organisational management and their staff to manage information security cost-effectively can use the ISMS. It can also help with the assessment of the trustworthiness of an organisation's information security arrangements by other organisations. An intelligent mix of aspects such as policies, standards, guidelines, codes-of-practice, technology, human issues, legal and ethical issues constitute an ISMS. Ideally organisations should opt for a combination of these different aspects in establishing an ISMS. The initial combination of all the aspects might by a bridge too far when embarking on the establishment of an ISMS, forcing organisations to take a 'phased' approach. One approach can be to implement the controls as contained in a standard such as ISO17799. In this case information security is driven from a management process point of view and referred to as 'process security'. Another approach that also complement or add to process security, is to use certified products in the IT infrastructure environment when possible. The approach here focuses on technical issues and is referred to as 'product security'.},

abstract = {We see, know and experience information systems development failures in many domains and in many countries. This paper will explore some of the issues related to the study of these failures. Every year, billions of dollars are wasted on failed projects in developed countries. Developing countries can learn from these grim experiences so as not to waste precious resources in repeating similar failures. The paper will emphasise the fact that the study of failures can only take place post-hoc, once a failure has been identified. Preparation is therefore different to normal scientific study where a situation is pre-selected in advance, the precise parameters are identified and decisions are made about the best methods for measuring them accurately and objectively. The literature reveals that researchers and practitioners have been experiencing projects failures for many years. Indeed, acknowledgements of failures go back at least thirty-five years. However, failures are still a prevalent problem. A significant obstacle related to the study of failures is the lack of acknowledged research methods for understanding such complex phenomena. The evidence collected during failure investigations emerges from a variety of sources, perspectives and contexts. Not surprisingly, it often appears to be ambiguous, incoherent and confused. The information collected tends to be rich, messy, contradictory and subjective. Such situations call for a new repertoire of methods to address the unique features of failures. This paper will introduce possible alternative ways of looking at and constructing failure stories. The techniques described below come under the umbrella term <i>forensic analysis</i>. The insights obtained from forensic analysis can be used for internal learning within organisations as well as externally within the discipline, thereby enabling practitioners and developing countries to benefit from the mistakes of others.},

Furthermore, the integral role that IS plays in delivering core business services or products implies that evaluation of the satisfaction of the e-Customer is implicitly an evaluation of service quality as well.

The Static Reflector addresses the particular problem of building wrappers which contain functions which take C function pointers as parameters. The pattern makes use of a static reflection method to facilitate the construction of cohesive, reusable framework classes which make use of such C functions. We show that the application of this pattern is surprisingly wide. Though concerned primarily with the interface between C and C++, the pattern has implications for and applications to other languages as diverse as Java and [incr Tcl].This pattern was workshopped at the PLOP 2001 conference, Illinois. It is structured according to the canonical form under the headings Name, Problem, Context, Forces, Solution, Resulting Context, Rationale, Examples and Related Patterns.},

abstract = {In this paper we present two transformations on automata, called stretching and jamming. These transformations will, under certain conditions, reduce the size of the transition table, and under other conditions reduce the string recognition time. Given a deterministic finite automaton, we can stretch it by transforming each single transition into two or more sequential transitions, thereby introducing additional intermediate states. Jamming is the opposite transformation, in which two or more successive transitions are transformed into a single transition, thereby removing redundant intermediate states.We will present formal definitions of stretching and jamming. We will give algorithms for stretching and jamming and we will calculate theoretical bounds, when stretching/jamming is effective in terms of memory consumption and string recognition time.},

abstract = {The user interface development process focuses on understanding users and their individual differences. These differences result from, inter alia, differences in culture. The primary goal of this research project was to determine whether Hofstede's [1991] cultural dimensions affect the performance achieved through the use of human-computer interaction. In order to achieve this goal, it was necessary to (1) identify the characteristics of the cultural dimensions; (2) identify test subjects and test interfaces displaying appropriate cultural dimensions and (3) assess the impact of these cultural dimensions on the speed, accuracy and satisfaction levels achieved by test subjects using the test interfaces to perform data collection tasks. Test subjects and website interfaces were identified in terms of the cultural dimension characteristics. The test subjects were selected based not only on their cultural dimensions, but also by controlling for user profile variables. The data resulting from the experiment was then analyzed to establish whether these dimensions had any impact on the performance achieved when using these websites. The results of the experiment did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that any of the tested cultural dimensions affected human performance. However, the performance levels attained suggest that the usability of the interfaces was increased for all users, as a result of accommodating high uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, collectivism and high power distance characteristics into the design of the interfaces. In addition, two main categories of further research have arisen as a result of this research. The first category comprises new research questions. The second focuses on the changes that should be made to the research design used for this research effort.},

address = {ZAF},
abstract = {Phylogenetics is difficult: many versions of the problem are NP-hard and HIV data in particular poses challenges. Different phylogenetic algorithms have been proposed; these can be broadly categorised into three groups: those that use some sort of distance measure on sequences; those that use a model of the number of evolutionary events (maximum parsimony); and maximum-likelihood approaches.Traditionally, phylogenetics is done on gene sequence data, and as such, algorithms have been designed with this purpose in mind. Recent advances in sequencing technology, however, has resulted in full genome sequences becoming increasingly accessible. Mass insertions, deletions, transversions and recombinations make traditional phylogenetic approaches ill-suited for analysing this type of data. In an attempt to address such data a number of authors have proposed an approach based on gene ordering.This paper is an experimental comparison of phylogenetic analysis performed on <i>env</i> data and full genome data using maximum likelihood and gene-order based algorithms on the same data. The purpose is to study the differences in what the algorithms predict, and to a lesser extent to evaluate their efficiency.We conclude that the trees constructed for the same set of data are different in structure. As full-genome analysis captures deep evolutionary events, and the <i>env</i> gene data analysis shallower events; the challenge remains in reconciling the results with a consistent model of evolution. Understanding which approach is the best to use has obvious importance for biologists, but is equally important for computer scientists in designing algorithms to understand the effect of trade-offs between correctness and efficiency in the design of heuristics.},

abstract = {A mobile ad hoc network is a dynamic mobile wireless network that can be formed without the need for any pre-existing wired or wireless infrastructure. One of the main challenges in an ad hoc network is the design of robust routing algorithms that adapt to the frequent and randomly changing network topology. Organizing mobile nodes into manageable clusters can reduce routing overhead and provide more scalable solutions. In this paper we propose a mobile agent-based clustering architecture for routing in mobile ad hoc networks. Using this clustering architecture, hybrid routing schemes can be employed for intra-cluster and inter-cluster routing to improve the performance of routing. All nodes use two mobile agents to perform routing and clustering operations. They collect routing and clustering information and periodically maintain the corresponding tables. We identify various parameters for improving network performance in the proposed clustering architecture. By using some optimal values for these clustering and routing parameters, more robust and scalable routing can be attained.},

It is therefore important to know what ALCs need to be replaced so that ALCs with a better classification are kept.

Firstly, we transform this diagram into intermediate diagram, called Testing Flow Graph (TFG), explicitly identify flows of UML statechart diagrams and enhance for testing. Secondly, from TFG we generate test case using the testing criteria that is the coverage of the state and transition of diagrams.

It is acknowledged that cryptography is commonly used to secure network communications and provide authentication functionality. However, due to the nature of mobile devices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants, the application of cryptography on a software level in Java wireless applications can slow down the execution time if not implemented properly since these devices are limited in terms of memory size, processing power, storage capacity and input/output facilities. Aside from performance aspects, inappropriate application of cryptography could weaken the security of a system, even worse the developer is not aware of it until the system is attacked. This paper presents a prototype framework that can be used to effectively and efficiently utilize cryptographic algorithms and protocols on Java enabled mobile devices.},

abstract = {The current methods for teaching programming skills fail to concentrate on the effective tools and strategies conducive to the creation of in-depth understanding of programming concepts and procedures. Mind tools such as concept mapping are not appropriately investigated in the present programming classrooms. Thus the needs of learners, particularly the holistic learners, are neglected.The aim of this paper is to explore concept mapping and instructional strategies applicable in promoting programming skills of holistic learners. The nature of this research required a qualitative research approach where individual interviewing was used to gather data. Ten students at the institution for higher education were identified as holistic learners with a pre-screening device.The findings of this study reveal the necessity for concept mapping and a peer-based collaborative environment in order to enhance a meaningful programming atmosphere. Holistic learners commented that concept mapping enhanced their learning, as it stimulated simultaneous, deductive or intuitive, concrete, and subjective processes relevant to their style of learning. Concept mapping enabled learners to focus on fine details, experiencing a structured step-by-step approach, representing their knowledge structures graphically and visualising programming concepts and procedures as a network of interrelated ideas. Findings indicated a need for concept mapping to be used in conjunction with practical and cognitive apprenticeship. This will enlarge and strengthen the insight into the programming process and set a climate for enhancing programming skills of holistic learners.},
