abstract = {The currently popular distributed, n-tiered, object-oriented application architecture provokes many design debates. Designs of such applications are often divided into logical 'tiers' -- usually user interface, business logic and domain object, or data, tiers, each with their own design issues. In particular, the latter contains data that needs to be stored and retrieved from permanent storage. Decisions need to be made as to the most appropriate way of doing this -- the choices are usually whether to use an object database, to communicate directly with a relational database, or to use object-relational mapping (ORM) tools to allow objects to be translated to and from relational form.Most often, depending on the perceived profile of the application, architects make these decisions using rules of thumb derived from particular experience or the design patterns literature. Examples include: object-oriented databases ease programming, relational databases ease report generation and data mining; object-oriented databases are good for navigation around an object model, relational databases are good for sequential processing and complex queries; if you are writing an application from scratch, use an object database, if you need to integrate to various sources of legacy data, use an ORM tool. Although helpful, these rules are often highly context-dependent and are often misapplied.Research into the nature and magnitude of 'design forces' in this area has resulted in a series of benchmarks, intended to allow architects to more clearly understand the implications of design decisions concerning object persistence. In this paper, the performance of selected open source object persistence tools is investigated, to attempt to clarify the myths surrounding the performance of the different options. In particular, we compare Hibernate, representative of the ORM stable, and db4o, representative of object-oriented databases. The OO7 benchmark is used to compare the speed of execution of a suite of typical persistence-related operations in both candidates. We then propose some preliminary explanations of the sometimes surprising results.},

abstract = {With growing interest in multiprocessor system-on-chip (SoC) designs and the increasing number of multicore designs at the high to medium end of the desktop and server markets, the question arises as to whether there should be convergence of the two concepts. This paper explores design principles for SoC multiprocessors and relates them to more general system requirements. It makes a case for focusing design efforts on symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) SoC designs, which have the best chance of making an impact in a wide range of markets, rather than designs for very specific niches, such as the IBM-Sony-Toshiba Cell processor. If SMP-SoC designs are successful, they could represent the next change in packaging in the general computer market: the next step after the microprocessor. A case is made not only for designing a SMP-SoC alternative to the Cell, but for using such a design as an alternative to an aggressively-pipelined uniprocessor.},

abstract = {This work focuses on developing a requirement engineering model (RSPL) based on a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and Web-tier Application Framework (WAF), to support automatic and interactive requirements generation when creating families of systems. In realizing the model, two goals were targeted namely (i) to construct a RE model that support automatic transformation of domain features into actor-specific requirements; and (ii) to design and implement an interactive web based tool for requirements engineering. The result obtained is twofold: (i) adopting MDA during RE for a product line reduced costs and development time; (ii) tool implementation based on WAF ensured that support for different client types was possible. In conclusion, the study is a contribution to a recently advocated idea that requirements generation could be model-driven. The result shows that the idea is promising with respect to requirement reuse and improving communication barriers among members of a system development team.},

Patterns from a training set are generalised to create a small number of rules, which can be used to identify items of interest within the text. The pattern matching technique is applied to finding the Speech-Verb, Actor and Speaker of quotes found in fiction books. The technique performs well over the training data, resulting in rule-sets many times smaller than the training set, but providing very high accuracy. While the rule-set generalised from one book is less effective when applied to different books than an approach based on hand coded heuristics, performance is comparable when testing on data closely related to the training set.},

In fact, all events in the game take place around the ball, and it is crucial to track the movement of the ball, players of both teams as well as the referee in order to perform analysis of the match both real-time and post match. A ball, player and referee detection, classification and tracking; team identification, and a field extraction approach is proposed in this paper. A higher level automatic offside event (OE) detection method is also proposed. The principle constraint considered during the development of the system was that the pattern recognition techniques had to be computationally efficient in terms of processing time. The system developed is a non-invasive vision-based decision support tool, capable of providing real-time analysis of a soccer match, including assisting the referee in making a decision concerning the offside rule.},

abstract = {Very large textures are prohibitive for most interactive terrain rendering due to the use of excessive resources. Alternatively, tiled textures can be linearly blended to produce interesting transitions between predefined textures. However, these transitions seldom work well when the texture frequency content is not high. This paper introduces blend maps, a technique used to enhance the blending of textures so that features of the underlying texture are maintained or emphasised. The resulting texture appears more realistic in many cases, and adds to the perceived detail of the terrain. Blend maps are constructed by identifying important features in a texture. These features are often highlighted under certain lighting conditions. The blend maps are created manually, but some automation is possible. The importance is then used to control a blending operation in such a way that features can be preserved. The proposed algorithm is simple enough to allow realtime rendering on modern graphics hardware.},

abstract = {Information systems development uses many different approaches and methodologies, such as soft systems methodology, to assist in the process of development and in the design of more successful information systems. However, many of these methodologies define information systems narrowly and fail to adequately take the larger contextual work environment into account. Activity Theory is a tool, borrowed from the field of psychology and development work research, which facilitates a more holistic view to be adopted by information systems practitioners and developers. In this paper Activity Theory, or more precisely the Activity Analysis and Development (ActAD) model, is used as an analytical tool in the design and development of an information system for an anti-retroviral treatment (ART) clinic in South Africa. The usefulness of applying the ActAD model is shown in this case study which focused on the investigation and observation of the quality of data and its use for decision support in the ART clinic. In addressing the question 'Does Activity Theory assist in highlighting challenges faced by the ART clinic with their current IS and assist in representing what users require from an IS?' we established the usefulness of the ActAD model in four areas. These included the identification of: the need for change; viewing information systems as part of the work activity; recognising the role of different stakeholders, and; the need for on-going support. We conclude that Activity Theory is a useful tool for information systems development and in particular the ActAD model is a tool which enables a more holistic approach to be taken in information systems development.},

abstract = {It is generally considered the ethical option to consult with the end users and other stakeholders when developing business Information Systems or conducting research in the IS discipline, whether with the express intention of empowering them or simply to include multiple points of view. This is also the 'smart' option as it is a way to improve the probability that the system will be useful, usable, and hence used. There are significant similarities between participants who are employees in an organisation for whom the system is being developed or researched and the case where the system is intended to benefit the public and hence the participants are members of civil society. However, there are ethical concerns regarding participatory research in IS that are more pronounced or have somewhat different aspects in community-based IS than in business IS. Conventional social science research ethics include codes which are largely based on four principles: informed consent; absence of deception; privacy and confidentiality, and; accuracy. However, as most of the literature on participatory research is westernised and based on traditional business IS, there is little discussion on ethical participation in community settings. Numerous different issues arise in such settings and are discussed in the paper. These include the need: to clearly define the roles and functions of the participants; to understand the nature of power sharing between participants; to take cognisance of the cost versus gains from participation; to be aware of domination in decision making; to understand local meaning; to develop the capacity to participate, and; to consider divergent expectations of participants. The previous experience of both authors support these arguments and discussion in this paper, but the objective of the paper is to present a conceptual research methodology discussion rather than an empirical research paper},

abstract = {This paper presents a model of network failure recovery based on a scheme for reallocating bandwidth in path-oriented transport networks. We first describe the bandwidth reallocation scheme where, at specified time points, bandwidth can be switched to those routes that (possibly temporarily) value it most highly. This is done entirely according to local rules and without centralised control.We next describe our model of network failure recovery. We consider a protection switching recovery model which works with pre-established reserve-on-demand recovery routes. A reserve-on-demand recovery route allocates required resources after a failure on the working path has been detected. The bandwidth reallocation scheme is used to distribute bandwidth between the working routes before and after a failure, and between the working and recovery routes during the recovery cycle.To support the efficacy of such a system, we present a simulation model of failure recovery in a 30-node 46-link network. The simulation study reveals that bandwidth reallocation allows rapid recovery after the failure of a single link. Traffic is restarted on a recovery route within one round trip time and the recovery path attains the same Grade of Service (GoS) as its working counterpart within 0.1 call holding times.},

This paper offers a discussion of the processes the authors went through from initial contact with the technology to implementing a system based on it, as well as the problems faced while working with WSAN. These experiences indicate the need for a dynamic, mote and application-independent management system. A service oriented architecture (SOA) for the management of WSAN, which makes use of OSGi, is proposed and evaluated. This SOA allows for the updating and changing of the application largely independent of the mote configuration as well as for easy management of different types of motes and actors.},

One limitation of current algorithm animation systems is their restricted flexibility in terms of the simple addition of non-resident functionality, especially algorithms. This paper presents the design of an extensible framework for algorithm animation systems. A brief discussion on the development of a prototype using sorting algorithms based on the framework demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed design.},

abstract = {As society becomes increasingly dependent on software, there is an increasing expectation of information systems to protect the individual's right to privacy. The process of attaining electronic consent (e-Consent) may perhaps improve the trust that society has in information systems to protect these rights. However, an issue such as e-Consent is usually not given due consideration, as it is a non-functional issue and the implementation of the e-consent mechanism in disparate and legacy systems is difficult. Hence many systems are implemented without such types of controls. Evidently, aspect-oriented software design is highly extensible, as security concerns may be easily integrated into a completed software product. In this paper it is proposed that aspect-oriented programming be used to augment an existing system with electronic consent.},

abstract = {Reflection on software engineering as a sub-discipline within computer science reveals that it is as much about people and teamwork as it is about technical expertise. It is therefore important that a software engineer is not only competent in software development but also able to work effectively in a team. Based on the scholarly literature we derived a simple model for team composition and used it to guide, without coercion, our students during team formation. This research reports on an investigation into the role of personality diversity within teams of tertiary students taking a course in software engineering. Data collected confirms that both personality diversity in teams as well as competence of teams impacts positively on team performance. In contrast to other studies, our research data does not seek to couple personality with appropriate role allocation in the team; rather, our measurement is in respect of "raw" team diversity alone. In this study the correlation between personality diversity and the success of teams were captured at different stages during the development of a software engineering project tackled by the teams. The same was done with correlation between competence and team success. The personality diversity of the teams showed a strong correlation with team success during the inception phase. This correlation however weakened during the course of the year while the correlation between competence and success started slightly weaker than personality diversity during the inception phase, but grew very strong towards the completion of the team projects.},

The study obtained performance measures and identified usability problems, but was focused primarily on using the testing technology to investigate distinguishing aspects of such applications, such as time usage patterns in domains where rapid completion is not necessarily a performance indicator. The paper addresses the issue of what, actually, is meant by 'usability' in learning environments. A pilot study identified obstacles and served to enhance the main study. Thinking-aloud on the part of participants provided useful data to support analysis of the performance measures, as can benchmarks and best case measures. Particular attention must be paid to ethical aspects. Features emerging from this study can contribute to a framework for usability testing and usage pattern analysis of interactive e-learning applications in cognitive domains.},

abstract = {Technology plays an ever-increasing role in our everyday lives. We would like it to be a help rather than a hurdle in our work, particularly in collaborating with others. An emerging problem for both individuals and groups is information spread and neglect, where users have the same copy of the same work, stored on various conventional devices, but no way to keep track of where the most recent version resides. One type of computer support collaborative work application, groupware, tackles this problem, aiming to assist in joint authoring projects, where artifacts such as files, pictures, reports and sound are being gathered to form a whole. Such groupware systems - and we survey seven of them - vary in terms of their functional, architectural, focal, temporal, user involvement and platform dependencies. While we found a wide variety of options for each system, there were also strong commonalities. All of them work with closed communities or groups. There is no public file sharing. All users are aware of all other collaborators in the community and all systems focus on collaboration; not sharing. The comparison includes our own system Nomad, a framework for distributed resource management, with special emphasis placed on the accessibility of information stored on detached devices, such as personal computers, laptops, PDA's and flash-disks. In the comparison, Nomad has advantages of flexibility and temporal independence over the other systems, together with low requirements on the user, and a high level of mobility and platform independence. The contributions of this paper are twofold: we identify and define a specific type of CSCW, groupware, together with a set of criteria for evaluating such systems; and we survey and classify some of the main systems according to the criteria, as well as introducing a custom-designed system, Nomad. From these results, a collaborative group of workers can more easily select a specific groupware that suits its needs. Moreover, designers of new systems will find the commonality factors useful, so they can more easily position their own products.},

abstract = {As competition increases, rising costs of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) come under the spotlight. As a result, there is pressure on ICT to deliver more with fewer resources. Unsuccessful projects became intolerable. Successful project management entails much more than completing projects in time and within budget. Quality, user satisfaction, effective team collaboration and effective resource management all contribute to project success. ICT unfortunately has a rather tarnished reputation when it comes to successful project delivery. Reasons why ICT projects often fail include poor planning, poor communication, poor project management skills, project complexity, ill-defined requirements and too many changes in scope. The ICT Department of the South African Reserve Bank is no exception. The main purpose of this paper is to determine whether or not the implementation of a project office in the ICT Department has addressed the problems identified in the literature and those previously experienced by the Bank.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the epistemic change operation of revision when the epistemic state of an agent is extended to include not only beliefs but knowledge too. An information-theoretic model of epistemic states is defined based on the notion of a templated ordering. A set of rationality postulates is defined for templated revision, which extends the AGM postulates, and a model-based representation result is provided characterising the proposed postulates. These postulates capture the intuition that during a revision, the agent's knowledge should grow monotonically while the agent's belief may grow nonmonotonically. It is shown that templated revision satisfies all the Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision, except for the controversial postulate (C2).},

One of the major reasoning problems in description logics is that of determining whether a given terminological knowledge base is consistent. One approach to this problem is to translate a modal satisfiability problem into stratified layers of constraint problems that can be solved by a constraint solver. We show how this approach, which was originally developed for the modal logic K, can be extended to deal effectively with cardinality restrictions on roles in the description logic ALCN. We also propose a further extension to this approach in order to deal with qualified number restrictions and arithmetic on role cardinalities.},

The purpose of this paper is threefold: to provide a literature overview of the existing software that detects microsatellites, either directly or indirectly; to compile criteria to which algorithms should comply in order to search effectively for microsatellites; and to motivate the corresponding parameters that have been designed to promote the usability of an analytical, effective algorithm to detect microsatellites.

abstract = {Web-based applications are rapidly making the transition to service oriented architectures, but this breaking up of single monolithic applications into multiple cooperating components creates complexity and management problems for system designers. This paper discusses a solution to one of the emerging complexity-related problems: how to package and distribute applications based on Web components for rapid and flexible deployment. To this end, a packaging framework was designed and reference implementations of package building and package installation tools were developed. The usability of such tools was then tested by a sample of users in the context of online information management systems, because of the availability of Web components and the inherent network-aware nature of such systems. The results are promising and demonstrate that the approach taken is reasonable and understandable and that such supporting technology for systems based on Web components is likely to positively impact the growth of advanced Web applications. In addition, the process of developing a proof-of-concept packaging system and the feedback from users has provided a useful set of requirements and guidelines for building such systems in future.},
