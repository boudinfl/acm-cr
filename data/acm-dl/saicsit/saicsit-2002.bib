Formal usability testing is an empirical method that requires the design of a formal usability experiment that is undertaken under controlled conditions in a usability laboratory. Formal usability testing produces actual measures of usability in terms of task effectiveness and efficiency. Existing software tools for visualising the results of formal usability testing are, however, limited and inadequate. This paper will discuss the typical components of such usability data and the design of a multiple view visualisation system to effectively view task efficiency that was based on recent guidelines for multiple view systems.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to find a minimal set of measures that allow the immediate, intuitive characterisation and visualization of the syntactic structure of models covering a particular application domain. The measures are validated against a test bed of twenty-two generic enterprise models. Traditional system engineering metrics were not very useful in characterizing or differentiating the different models. Instead, it was found that the frequency distribution of the entity fan-outs for each model provided a distinct model signature. Although the characteristics of these distributions are visually immediately apparent, traditional descriptive statistics for frequency distributions fail to capture the essential shape of fan-out distributions. This is due to their extreme skewness and the presence of extreme outliers. This paper proposes four summary statistics to describe the fan-out distributions, thus providing a compact and intuitive signature for a model: one categorical classification ('waves' and 'slides'), and three numeric metrics namely the harmonic mean fan-out (to replace the arithmetic mean), a smoothness/bumpiness value and a shape curvature coefficient.},

abstract = {Curriculum planning is undertaken by University students at least once a year. Some Universities allow students to study part-time and to make up their degree in successive years by accumulating a few modules each year. The curriculum-planning process becomes far more complicated in this case since students can enrol for modules at different levels concurrently. Exacerbating factors are phased-out modules, complicated module requirements and inexperienced advising staff. When these factors are taken into account the planning process becomes far more error-prone.A prototype advisor support tool, named Zazu, was developed to address the problems related to paper-based advising. In evaluating the tool a marked difference between the user-satisfaction of expert and novice advisors emerged. This paper discusses the differences between experts and novices in using the advisory support tool, and draws conclusions about how best to structure user interfaces for each advisor category based on the results obtained from the Zazu study.},

abstract = {With the increasing use of distributed knowledge work in a range of industrial, scientific, and organizational environments, understanding how to support such work has become increasingly important. From previous field and laboratory studies, we know that a range of socio-technical factors influence performance and satisfaction in distributed teams. Among the most important of these factors are trust, leadership and the level of media richness in the computer-mediated communications environment. We also know that specific socio-technical interventions can help to build trust in CMC environments. However, many of these studies have not taken into consideration sufficiently the impact of cross-national cultural factors on distributed teams. This paper reports the preliminary analysis of a thirteen week qualitative and quantitative quasi-experimental field study of distributed collaborative learning teams, consisting of 35 post-graduate students from four research universities, two in the United States and two in South Africa. These teams completed a series of unstructured strategy and decision-making tasks, using a suite of rich-media CMC tools. Data are reported from participant surveys, narrative evaluation essays, and observations.},

Students were allowed to do their collaborative work in various settings including working as a virtual team communicating entirely via e-mail. A pluralist research approach was adopted in which questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data and recordings were made of both e-mail and f-to-f discussions and these all provided data to be interpreted. Thus, an interpretive research strategy was used. Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action was used in the in-depth analysis of the discourse that took place in order to compare the type of collaboration that occurred in the different types of team. It is important to note that the action research cannot be considered to have 'been successful' but lessons were nevertheless learned. A relationship was noted between the amount and kind of information that can be shared, the time taken to share this information and the nature of the relationships within the teams. Although the action research was carried out in an educational setting, and hence was focussed on collaborative learning, it has relevance in virtual organisations of all types.},

abstract = {Software restructuring is a form of perfective maintenance that modifies the structure of a program's source code. Its goal is increased maintainability to better facilitate other maintenance activities, such as adding new functionality to, or correcting previously undetected errors within a software system. Changes to the structure are introduced through the application of transformations. Manually transforming the source code may introduce undesirable as well as undetectable changes in the system's behaviour. It is very difficult to ensure that manual restructuring preserves functionality and guaranteeing it is almost impossible. The problems associated with manual restructuring can be addressed by using a restructuring tool to automatically apply transformations. The majority of restructuring tools apply transformations by manipulating abstract program representations and specify the conditions of the transformation in terms of the representation structure. The context entity graph as program representation was developed to support specific language constructs, but can be adapted to support a variety of programming languages. The implementation of a code abstraction transformation in terms of this structure is examined and various improvements are also suggested.},

publisher = {South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists},
address = {ZAF},
abstract = {Classification and prediction algorithms for machine learning typically require all training data to be resident in memory during decision tree construction. Typically, a flat file is created from database or data warehouse data and loaded into memory for processing. This severely limits the scalability of these algorithms to practical data mining tasks. Some attempts have been made by researchers to implement disk-based algorithms which can handle much larger training sets. Both approaches suffer from three serious limitations. The first limitation is that a significant amount of the original data must be duplicated on disk. The second limitation is that these algorithms are unable to utilize the computational capabilities of the data warehouse or database system. The computation of sums, counts and averages are some of the operations that database / data warehouse systems can do very efficiently. The third limitation is that these algorithms produce very inflexible decision trees which cannot be manipulated by the analyst. This is because they fail to take advantage of those features of data cube technology that enables analysts to view data at different levels of abstraction. This paper proposes a data mining approach that removes the need to copy data from a data warehouse or database. The approach also facilitates On-line Analytical Mining (OLAM) as it integrates database and data warehouse queries with decision tree construction.},

Literature addressing the full range of problems is limited and mostly discusses single security threats or subsets of security problems and their possible solutions. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the different security threats that can possibly be imposed on agents by malicious hosts, and then provide a classification of these threats before we describe the current solution approaches that are implemented to address the identified problems. By providing such a classification we were able to identify specific gaps in current research efforts, and enable researchers to systematically focus their attention on different classes of solutions to remedy these threats.},

The metadata specification of CUBER is based on the emerging LOM standard of IEEE, but CUBER has introduced some modifications to the original LOM schema. Nevertheless, special attention was paid to making the CUBER metadata conform to the LOM standard for the interoperability issues. In this paper, the metadata model introduced in the CUBER project is presented. In particular, the recognized metadata requirements are analysed, and the relationships of the developed model to other relevant projects and standardization activities are discussed.},

In this way flow of control is formally separated from data manipulation which makes it possible to use a standard verification technique to check control flow at the implementation level. At the same time testing is simplified significantly. The alternating bit protocol is used to explain the proposed method. In addition, an implementation of the TCP protocol is discussed to illustrate that the technique is also applicable to reactive systems of realistic size and complexity.},

An investigation of the literature reveals that when organisations initiate a knowledge management effort, most of them tend to over-emphasise the role of information technology at the expense of the human factor. A preliminary survey of local organisations using Duffy's Knowledge Management Benchmarking Questionnaire confirms these findings. This paper then proposes a framework that will address the shortcomings in current knowledge management implementation strategies. The framework consists of three main interlinked components: Knowledge Management of the Organisation, People, and Infrastructure and Processes. The framework focuses on the importance of aligning the knowledge management strategy of the organisation with the overall business strategy of the organisation. The culture and managing the culture change when implementing knowledge management are also dealt with. Furthermore, the framework recommends a holistic approach to managing knowledge.},

address = {ZAF},
abstract = {An organisation succeeds by bringing together and managing
certain resources in a productive way. The traditional list of
resources comprises labour (manpower), money, material, managers,
machines and facilities. Only over the past two decades has
information come to be recognised as another resource, one that is
crucial to the management of others and one, which under certain
circumstances, may be substituted for them cost-effectively.Information shares many properties with other resources: it has
value and lends itself to the process of management. Information is
a valuable resource and hence must be managed in a well-designed
system so that managers are able to obtain relevant information
timeously for their decision-making processes.One of the major problems of organisations that make them fail
may be insufficient utilisation of the major resource of the
organisation, viz. information. Managers have to be aware of
utilising management information systems effectively to be
competitive in the business world. Many managers in the
manufacturing industries in South Africa may be unaware of the
capabilities and use of an effective MIS.Most manufacturing industries are possibly already using
products of Information Technology. However, their awareness level
of applying information technology to designing effective
management information systems to overcome their specific problems
needs to be investigated and determined.To be effective in today's dynamic and competitive business
environment, a manager, and indeed, an organisation, must think in
the system mode. Technological innovation has simplified the
collection of data into sophisticated information systems. With
appropriate management information systems in place, managers can
focus their attention on the creative elements of management such
as developing strategy, searching for new opportunities and
competitive advantages, and optimising the use of the
organisation's resources.The primary objective of this research was to establish the
impact of management information systems (MIS) and information
technology on the success of manufacturing industries. The other
aim of the study was to investigate the extent of applying
information technology in these industries. The study focused on
medium and large-scale chemical manufacturing companies in the Cape
Metropole area that have operated at least for the past five years.
The empirical data were collected through questionnaires.Frequency and multiple regression analysis were applied to
analyse the data. The results of the analysis indicate that most of
the managers of the companies appear to be aware of the
capabilities and use of MIS for their business success. However,
there are still some managers who are unaware of MIS. It was also
found that utilisation of MIS in manufacturing companies and
applying information technology have a positive impact on their
success.},

abstract = {Many organisations have initiated enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects using various software packages. JDEdwards is a leading ERP software vendor. The difficulty with effectively implementing ERP systems suggests that many organisations do not appreciate the issues and problems typically encountered during the ERP life cycle.A post-implementation review is one important stage of the ERP life cycle. Little research has been undertaken on the ERP post-implementation stage in a metropolitan municipal environment in South Africa.During 1997 eThekwini Municipality embarked on an ERP project to replace its in-house non-integrated financial systems. Some 555 user specifications were identified. JDEdwards was selected as the preferred ERP supplier. In July 1999 the implementation successfully went live with 1150 named users.A post-implementation review of the identified user specifications and general user satisfaction was conducted. This case study reports on this ERP post-implementation stage. Quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to analyse the collected user specification and general user satisfaction data.The contributions of this paper can be summarised as:1. increasing the understanding of the ERP post-implementation stage in metropolitan municipal environment in South Africa;2. confirming the existence of this stage in the ERP life cycle;3. developing a richer understanding of some issues in a successful ERP implementation environment;4. noting the importance of formalising this stage;5. suggesting future ERP research agenda; and6. reporting that the interview process facilitates gauging user satisfaction with the ERP software solution.},

abstract = {Agility is a term used when describing an organizations ability
to change and has been written about by many authors and used in
many forums --- it is used to describe the core capability of an
organization to move with times, or move with strategy. Agility is
defined in the Oxford dictionary as 'The gracefulness of a person
or animal that is quick and nimble'. Business Agility is the
gracefulness of an organization to quickly redesign itself for
strategic, tactical or operational reasons. Businesses would do
this to stay competitive, restructure or expand into other markets.
The inhibitor becomes the ability of the software systems to adapt
to the new requirements. Software systems typically are constructed
for single purpose implementations and hardly ever cater for
effective re-use. Reuse could obviously mean many things as bits of
code can be reused, but maybe components cannot be reused.
Inevitably there is a shortcoming in being able to change existing
systems or realize new requirements quickly.Software-as-services is a concept that has been used in a number
of architectures to facilitate reuse and to deal the plug-and-play
abilities of software. CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture) based software standards have a clearly defined means
of using software-as-services to perform a variety of tasks for
example authentication and name resolution services. Operating
system services are used to provide device independent services for
example printer drivers.In software architecture, the term common-customer-view has
become the latest and highly debated strategic topic. Research in
the financial services sector shows that business has silos of data
and applications that exist in isolation and has cumbersome
integration processes and technology. A typical problem is that
these large organizations would have several copies of their
customer data stored in diverse software applications that each
focus on a specific business product or functional business area.
How can organizations protect their existing software
infrastructures whilst moving towards a more integrated,
common-face-to-software-for-customer based architecture?Service based architecture (SBA) is a layered architecture that
separates the usage and definition of software components, from the
implementation software architecture in order to define
software-as-services using a common standard. This paper presents
an approach whereby service based architecture can be used as a
means to assemble software systems from loosely coupled
software-as-services in such a way that concepts such as common
customer views can be achieved easily. A separation continuum is
used to describe how business models and technology architectures
are used. Web Services is one example of how software-as-services
is implemented. This paper uses this as a focus area to explain
implementations as momentum is already created in the software
industry backing from many major players like IBM, Microsoft, SUN,
BEA and HP.Related work has been published through the Software Product
Line Practice Conference (SPLC1 and SPLC2) hosted by Carnegie
Mellon University and Software Engineering Institute, and Computer
Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC) conferences. This
paper presents specific findings and presents solutions that relate
to service based architecture where other published work is more
generic in nature. Since research is still under way, some interim
findings are discussed. Nine large financial services organizations
is South Africa, three in Germany and two in the United States of
America form part of this research.},

abstract = {Software delivery organisations are required to produce
commercially viable innovative products in a short space of time. A
balance must be created between product innovation and process
innovation, when developing software systems, to ensure product
commercialisation. While numerous software engineering 'best
practices' exist, such as ISO/IEC JTC1 Software Engineering
Standards, SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) and
SEBOK (Software Engineering Institute), these focus on the direct
delivery of software and often fail to connect with the realities
of commercial business.Quality related bodies form a system for worldwide
standardisation as a whole and, together with the Software
Engineering Institute (IES), Quality Assurance Institute (QAI) and
others, have played an important role in providing this
balance.The Process Innovation Imperative [Van Zyl 2001] is an
investigation that was the result of thirteen years of research in
the software and related industries. This research identified
various conceptual models that were used together with the ISO/IEC
TR 15504 framework in order to facilitate process innovation. This
paper covers work that was performed for the period June 1999
through to March 2001, as part of the Process Improvement
Imperative, in the engineering division of a medium sized new
generation IT company. The organisation was founded in 1994 and
delivers dynamic, component-based applications to customers in the
financial services industry that meet their needs in rapidly
changing business environments and that are flexible to adapt to
changing needs over time.The purpose of the work reported in this paper, carried out as
part of the Product Management Architecture project, was firstly to
re-implement and focus product line practices within a
software-producing organisation. This was done by implementing the
models identified in the Process Innovation Imperative within the
framework of ISO/IEC TR 15504; and secondly to record and analyse
data in order to derive empirical evidence of improvements within
the organisation.The paper describes the process that was used, and the data
collected during this process is used to provide empirical evidence
of improvements within the organisation.},

abstract = {The Internet has become a major resource in modern business and
many businesses are creating a web presence. A business' website
can become a storefront and needs to function efficiently, having
the aesthetic appeal to attract and retain customers. Pick 'n Pay
[2001] have recently developed an online grocery store that allows
customers to purchase products and have the goods delivered to your
home. There are however implications to the business when deciding
to provide an e-commerce service. Important considerations are that
a website is functionally complete, secure and ensures the business
will receive payment for the goods sold.Development time and costs are important factors to consider
when a business plans to set up an e-commerce website and therefore
various implementation options available needs to be considered.
Internationally accepted guidelines have been developed to provide
companies and website developers with strategies to follow when
implementing effective e-commerce websites [Nielson, 2001]. The
business needs to further decide who will design the website and
how it will be done. An IT professional/company can provide these
services, however there are other options available to the
business. In-house development can be done with the use of a
software package, such as an e-commerce construction kit. The
questions a business should consider is which implementation method
should they consider and how would the resulting systems differ?
The final result could have large implications on how the website
looks, functions and costs and therefore will effect the business's
decision.This research project aimed to select a general retail business,
develop two fully functional prototype e-commerce websites for the
business using two implementation methods and compare the two
methods. One website was development using ASP and another site
designed with the use of an e-commerce construction kit, ECBuilder.
Each site listed various products and allowed the user to purchase
products making use of a shopping cart. An efficient search
facility was incorporated to allow clients to easily find
products.Users making use of user interface satisfaction and
functionality criteria evaluated the websites. The two prototypes
were compared with regards to design and implementation criteria,
in order to obtain research results as to which design method a
small businesses could consider, when opting for online retail
website development. The results of the usability evaluation showed
that a custom made ASP prototype provided a better user interface.
The results from the functionality tests performed on each system
indicated that the ASP website provided better overall
functionality with regards to ease of use, the intuitivism of the
screens and the time taken to complete each of the tasks.The results from a design perspective showed that the toolkit
website took only forty-five minutes to set up, whereas the ASP
site took roughly one-hundred and thirty-four hours to develop. The
cost of each website differs drastically. A business that intends
to implement an e-commerce website needs to evaluate certain
criteria to decide which method will be the best for them. These
could include the size of their budget, the time available for the
design and implementation, possible aesthetics and the ease of
maintenance. This project has proven that each method has its
advantages and disadvantages and it is up the business to decide
which option is the best for them.},

abstract = {Command and Control (C2), an integral part of Information
Warfare, is focused on the use of communications and computer
systems to allow all kinds of warfare to be won. A major issued
faced by military decision makers involved in C2 is the need to
respond quickly to complex battle situations during a time of
conflict. Military commanders operate within an historically
hierarchical management structure, which now depends heavily on
network-based information systems. Often the technical skills and
expertise necessary to operate complex systems now reside much
lower down the chain-of-command so that military leaders themselves
cannot access or interpret the complex information that is
gathered. Working internationally poor language skills are often a
barrier and to aid decision making, data must be presented in an
appropriate form keeping this in mind.One mechanism for displaying abundant amounts of disparate
information is through <i>information visualization</i>
[Goodburn 1999], exploiting the natural abilities of the user to
rapidly understand, analyse and evaluate information displayed in a
graphical form. A vast number of approaches and formats are used in
information visualisation. It can be used to represent an entity
with a physical form, as well as to model synthetic systems such as
software systems and intranets [Pattison et al 2001]. An advantage
of computer-based visualisation is that the underlying information
that the information visualisation views are created from can be
very generic. The description of the information displayed can be
made very flexible, allowing the user to interact with the system
and change the description to suit their circumstances. The user
can change the description and the new model can be generated in a
near real-time response. Allowing the user to explore the different
parts of the model. This paper describes
<i>InVision,</i> a component based visualisation
environment developed by the Defence Science and Technology
Organisation and its research partners, to investigate a range of
issues related to the rapid assembly and deployment of adaptive
visualisation systems. Issues being investigated include view
management and sharing, novel visualization approaches and
intelligent agent support.<i>Augmented Reality</i> (AR) refers to the process
of overlaying computer-generated images spatially registered to the
real world, allowing users to visualize three-dimensional virtual
objects in the real world and interact with them in a natural way.
By using a head mounted display placed on the user's head it is
possible to completely replace the user's view of the real world
with this computer-enhanced world. ARVIS is a C based application
designed to investigate new interaction techniques in AR. It
provides the user with mechanisms for direct manipulation and
command input of virtual objects. The users can not only display
three-dimensional models on fiducial markers, but also interact
with them. This interaction allows the user to both select parts of
the models, to change their attributes, and to manipulate the
selected components. When parts of models are selected, the user is
also able to map a translation onto the selected components. This
paper describes an AR view capability that was added as an
extension to <i>InVision</i> with components that allow
any of the views in an <i>InVision</i> workspace to be
displayed through an AR tangible interface, incorporating ARVIS as
a component into the <i>InVision</i> framework.},

abstract = {Information and functions available in mobile phones increase
all the time, but at the same time the size of the phones
decreases. This leads to a problem of presenting efficiently as
much information as possible on a small display. Here a visual
search paradigm was used to measure and compare search times on a
small display with text and icons used as targets. We also studied
the effect of simultaneously shown icons' features on target icon
search times. The aim of the study was to compare the search times
on a small display when text or icons are used as targets and
distractors and to further study the effect of different types of
distractors when using icons. We were also interested to see how
suitable the traditional visual search paradigm is for
human-computer interaction research.Fifteen subjects (8 women) took part in the experiments.
Thirteen icons and thirteen words were used as stimuli. Icons were
acquired from an actual mobile phone user interface. For some of
the trials, icons were divided into two groups: filled and not
filled. The words used were 5-6 letter Finnish words with the first
letter capitalized. The main results of this study were:1. Visual search is significantly faster on small display when
icons rather than text are used as targets and distractors. The
difference in search times also increases when the number of items
on the display is increased. With a set size of fifteen, the
reaction times were two times greater in text search than in icon
search.2. Search times can be greatly affected with by choosing the
concurrently shown icons properly.3. Search times in pop-out---search remain on a same level
despite the size of the set. This result differs from the
expectations in the study based on cognitive psychology
paradigm.The fact that icon search was faster than text search was not in
itself surprising, because in text search there are always more
characters on the screen. The results from 'pop-out' ---search show
that effects due to the target-distractor differences, that are
known from basic research, hold in more applied conditions as well.
The greatest differences in search times were observed between text
and icon search tasks and they were about half a second. This may
seem small at first, but one has to keep in mind that in these
experiments, subjects had only one task to handle. There is a long
way from this to a real life situation, in which the phone is often
used while simultaneously attending to other, often more demanding
tasks as well. One would expect the difference to be even greater
in that kind of situation. Text is naturally always going to play a
part in mobile phone interface. Still, it was shown here that the
icons are found faster and that the search times can be affected by
features of adjacent icons. When designing an interface to a
small-display device, designing and choosing adjacent icons
properly may help to make the device more efficient to use.},

abstract = {The computational treatment of morphologically complex languages, such as those belonging to the Bantu language family, requires as basic computational aids a machine-readable lexicon containing a list of all the word roots in the language as well as a computational morphological analyser/generator.In Zulu, where words are formed by productive affixations of derivational and inflectional suffixes to roots or stems, the constant core element in a word is the root. For example a single verb root in Zulu may have hundreds of thousands of different inflected/derived forms. At present no (comprehensive) machine-readable lexicon exists for Zulu. Since a machine-readable lexicon constitutes a key language resource in human language technology and natural language processing, and should therefore be readily accessible, reusable and portable, we discuss our development of such a resource as an XML document. In order to perform this task of maintaining and updating the lexicon in a systematic and exhaustive way, we elaborate on the automation of the identification and extraction of new roots from real natural language corpora. We explain that in order to do this for a language such as Zulu a computational morphological analyser/generator is required.In Pretorius and Bosch [2002] we reported on a first prototype of a computational morphological analyser/generator for Zulu in which the morphology of Zulu nouns was covered, using the Xerox finite-state calculus and tools to model and implement the appropriate morphotactics and alternation rules for a selected Zulu lexicon.In this paper we report on subsequent work, focussing on the design, building, and continued updating of a Zulu XML lexicon, using a variant of the morphological analyser/generator, called a guesser. We highlight the fundamental role that regular expressions play in XML, in the morphological analyser/generator, and in the guesser variant of the analyser as a tool for mining, exploring and analysing electronically available Zulu corpora.},

publisher = {South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists},
address = {ZAF},
abstract = {The term <i>full name</i> is used for a surname plus
zero or more forenames (first names) of a person. Searching a large
database which contains at least the full name of an individual and
the date of birth, e.g. in our case a genealogical database
containing about 525 000 person records, could be problematic and
is discussed in this paper. The full name recorded may not be exact
or complete, and dates may also not be accurate and could in some
cases be estimates. The discussion includes the handling of
spelling variations, aliases and/or derivatives of names, double
barrel names and incomplete information --- e.g. maiden names of
females are not present, or forenames are permuted, dropped or
inserted. As an illustration, assume that the database contains the
target <i>Van de Venter, Loubser Petrus Johannes
Frederick,</i> but a search for <i>Van Deventer,
Laubscher Pieter Jan Derick,</i> is requested. A proper
search algorithm should yield the target. Also note that a
double-barrel name like <i>Mari-Ann,</i> could be
treated as two different names or a single name. These problems
occurs in many applications where records of a large number of
persons are stored e.g. archive databases, burial, cemetery and
church records, military records of soldiers, hospital records,
telephone directory, voters rolls, etc. Various methods such as the
so-called <i>Soundex</i> type methods, and attempts to
define a distance function between full names using, for example,
weighted transformations, were investigated with no acceptable
success.The first algorithm proposed, required that names considered as
equivalent be grouped together in equivalent classes, and stored in
a name database that is being updated on a regular basis.
Propositions in names were dropped, e.g. <i>Van der
Merwe</i> and <i>Merwe</i> were put in the same
equivalence class. Double barrel names like
<i>Mari-Ann</i> and <i>Mariann</i> have
been put in the same equivalence class, but <i>Mari
Ann</i> was treated as two separate names. Within each
equivalence class one name is identified as the
<i>characteristic name</i> that represents all the
names of the class. An equivalent name index was built. In order to
overcome the missing maiden name problem, an additional entry is
made in the index for every marriage of a female by substituting
her maiden name by her husband's surname. This approach solved the
problems with spelling variations and missing maiden names, but a
few problems remained. Firstly, due to naming traditions the hit
rate could be high, but this problem can be relieved by
concatenating the date of birth at the end of the search key.
Secondly, due to the large number of entries and long keys the
lookup is fairly slow which is aggravated by the repeated lookup in
the name database to build the search key. This is overcome by
encoding the characteristic names using a two-byte code that
retains the lexicographic order. This produced very satisfactory
results with search times for the first matching target record of
less than a second on an average PC.In spite of the very good performance of this search algorithm,
it has a major shortcoming in that the allocation of a name to an
equivalence class is problematic. Often an equivalence class is too
large and contains names that are very remote because of a
continuum of similarities, e.g. <i>Pete, Peet, Piet, Pietje,
Pieterjie, Pieter, Petrus, Pieternella, Nella, Nellie,</i>
and <i>Nelie.</i> It was fairly obvious that the
classes should not be too large, but that a name should appear in
more than one set. Consequently, names were grouped into similarity
sets --- a name could appear in more than one set. In case of a
double barrel name like <i>Jansen van Vuuren,</i> it
was put in three similarity sets, the first set containing itself,
the second set containing <i>Jansen,</i> and the third
set containing <i>Van Vuuren.</i> An index were
compiled on full name containing an entry for all possible
combinations of the characteristic names of the similarity sets
which contain the names constituting the full name. Although this
index is significantly larger, the search speed is still less than
a second. Future work will include the use of inverted indexes on
the name using the similarity sets and investigate and evaluate
some of the search techniques used on the Internet. Such methods
should fully provide for the permutation of forenames and partially
for the dropping and/or addition of forenames.},

abstract = {Many metaphors from other disciplines are used in the field of information systems. Through the years software engineering, business process reengineering, software architecture and other concepts have drawn from fields like engineering and architecture.The one use of the term concerns the whole organization while the other concerns individual systems. These two concepts should be distinguished by introducing the concepts of town planning to stand next to architecture. This can help information system academics and practitioners better understand the current concept of information system architecture because many lessons can be learnt from the field of town planning and applied to information systems.The parallels between architecture and information systems have been studied in detail by various authors. Certain authors describes architecture as a reference discipline for MIS because both are design fields, both involve designers and users and both use technology to create an artifact to serve users.The parallels between town planning and information systems, on the other hand, have not been studied at all. This paper's main premise is that we should make a clear distinction between the high-level planning of systems on an organizational level and the high-level planning on a systems level. Specific systems can be compared to individual buildings and the organization can be compared to a town. Maybe the metaphor of town (or urban) planning should be added to our vocabulary.The benefits of this would be to clearly highlight the fundamental differences between the two areas. Many lessons can also be learned from the built environment, which includes town planning and architecture. For instance, in the built environment there is a clear distinction between different roles and disciplines. An architect, town planner and builder have different training paths and very specific roles that they play. This is something that the IT world could consider more seriously.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the role of HCI design patterns for
software development in the transaction processing (TP) application
domain. The concept of a design pattern, whilst popular in several
other fields including architecture and software engineering is
relatively new to human-computer interaction (HCI). The potential
of pattern languages as a vehicle for the dissemination of HCI
design knowledge is becoming widely recognized within the HCI
community [Tidwell 1998; Van Welie 2001; Wesson 2001]. The TP
application domain has its own set of unique design problems. User
interface (UI) designers are faced with design challenges that are
specific to this application domain. This paper discusses the
development of a pattern language for transaction processing
systems (TPS) that has been used to successfully design several
TPS.TPS refers to a class of programs that facilitates and manages
transaction-oriented applications, typically for data entry and
retrieval transactions. TPS are prevalent in most areas of the
construction and engineering industries, from maintaining stock
levels in an electronics repair shop, to recording time and
attendance information for a large engineering concern. The
Transaction Processing Pattern Language (PL) discussed in this
paper can be divided into two main categories: patterns that deal
with general UI design; and patterns that focus specifically on TP.
In the context of this paper, our discussion focuses on the TP
patterns. Specifically the patterns related to data management
(viewing, capturing and editing) are discussed.Usability is a key factor for the success of online TPS. These
systems must be designed to meet specific usability objectives and
accommodate a wide diversity of users. A heuristic evaluation was
conducted of the usability of the UI designs created using the
Transaction Processing PL [Nielsen 1994]. This usability evaluation
revealed no significant usability problems. The user interface
design was found to meet its key usability objectives: readability,
consistency, efficiency, productivity and error prevention. Pattern
languages and design patterns can represent a solution to the
design problems facing UI designers. This PL has been used to
facilitate knowledge and skills transfer from a UI design expert to
novice UI designers in a South African software company. While
considerable research must still be done to refine and extend the
proposed PL, it nevertheless represents a significant contribution
to understanding the problems facing designers of TPS and the
possible solutions.},

abstract = {The process of marketing encompasses three functions: to inform,
remind and persuade. The growth of the Internet signified a dawn of
a new age of marketing; a low cost form of marketing that presented
vast economies of scale. It can further be said that using the
Internet provided a business advantage [Aldridge et al. 1997].
However, the Internet's business advantage is not as great anymore
as most medium and large sized companies have a web site. In the
mid and late 1990's, e-commerce companies were willing to spend
vast amounts of money on advertising, apparently without concern
for the returns on the investment. Companies who were keen to
harness the potential of the Internet soon became disillusioned
with over-hyped expectations. E-commerce companies are now reducing
expenses and investment in online marketing and technology
[Aldridge et al. 1997:162, Bonanos 2001, Mollison 2002, Joseph
&amp; Poon 2001].It stands to reason that a more targeted approach would be more
efficient and cost effective. Customizing of advertising messages
to be appropriate for individuals receiving the information would
reduce resources required to generate revenue. The main benefit of
this marketing technique is that advertisers are able to target
individuals with advertising that is related to their interests or
needs. However, a major issue with Targeted Marketing is privacy.
The reason is that a collection of information is required about
individuals in order to make it effective. The more detailed the
information, the more accurate the targeting. The use of targeted
marketing does not guarantee commercial success as many other
factors are involved; there are numerous examples, which prove this
to be the case [Bonanos 2001].Search engines currently play a significant role in targeted
online marketing. It is even claimed to be highly successful for
advertisers. Although this may be a general belief, little
investigative research has been done on this topic. Related areas,
which this paper will attempt to investigate, include search
engines and their ability and effectiveness of delivering targeted
advertising. In summary, the problem addressed here is value of
Internet marketing. It would appear that marketing via search
engines is not a straightforward process.This paper is an investigation into Keyword Targeted Marketing
as provided by most search engines. Issues that are discussed
include the reasons for using this form of advertising, the media
used in the advert presentation, the various levels of accuracy in
matching keywords to banner advertisements, the metrics used to
evaluate performance and challenges that have been discovered in
its implementation. A company that wants to increase its exposure
to potential clients via search engine usage, may do so by 'buying'
certain keywords which describe their business. Usage of any of
these keywords by a potential client of this search engine will
result in a pop-up advertisement on the user's screen. Marketing
and advertising on Internet websites have entered an exiting new
era with many possibilities to be explored. However, some less
invasive measures to explore these possibilities might have to be
found.},

abstract = {For a long time technological sectors have been working in isolation, and in competition. The three sectors of focus, namely, telecommunications, media, and information technology started as stand-alone sectors. Each sector had its own objectives and goals. Although, these sectors overlapped significantly from time to time, a closer inspection was hardly taken. At times, the information technology sector overlapped with the telecommunications sector, the media sector with the information technology sector, or all three. At this day and age, these sectors do more than overlap, they merge. The convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) has led to the integration of data, voice, graphics, and video into a digital environmentThe one certainty in today's business world is change. The convergence of an increasing range of communication technologies and applications is driving demand for new and innovative communications services that supports business growth, communication, technology, and the mediaThis paper examines the coming together of different sectors and technologies to bring about innovative services and products. The research is then narrowed to the South African context. Investigation of the status of cable television and the convergence of different sectors in South Africa is inspected. A glimpse of the envisaged future of the topic of the convergence of technologies in South Africa is stated.},

abstract = {Higher Education in South Africa at tertiary level has been
undergoing intensive investigations about restructuring by national
government in the last few years. South Africa has two distinct
types of tertiary educational institution: Technikon and
University. South Africa is seeking to build a mixed
research/teaching profile for Technikons. In January 2002, a
National Working Group recommended to the National Minister of
Education various mergers between institutions aimed at systemic
financial and academic problems. One academic problem specially
noted was the low level of research output from the Technikon
sector. This paper overviews the background to this altered mission
for Technikons in South Africa. It then specifically describes
activities at Cape Technikon to promote research activity in all
disciplines. Moving to Faculty level, this paper reports on steps
taken within the Faculty of Business Informatics towards developing
a mixed culture of research and teaching, from a teaching-dominated
past.Findings from a part of a survey of all academic staff in the
Faculty (including Information Technology academics) on motivations
for their own participation in research activity and their ideal
work mix are presented. The paper reports on two components of the
survey viz. motivational factors for participation in research
activity, and respondents' choice of work mix. A list was compiled
of motivating factors, as they existed at national, Cape Technikon
(institutional), and faculty (Business Informatics) level. A fourth
category of motivational factors, personal factors, was also
compiled. In total, fifteen factors were identified across the four
categories: national (2), institutional (3), faculty (5) and
personal (5). The second component (of the survey) that is reported
on, identifies the extent to which the Technikon academics favoured
inclusion of research activity as part of their daily work
load.Of the top five motivational factors chosen by the respondents
three factors were from the personal category, and two from the
faculty category. This suggests that lecturers were motivated by
issues that were secondary to research outcomes. Although the top
ranked factor was 'personal satisfaction', enhancement of prospects
for job promotion in academia as well as opportunities outside Cape
Technikon were also factors amongst the top five. Pressure from
authority at Dean/Head of Department level showed little response,
since it was the (equally) least chosen amongst all the factors,
with only 1 of the 17 respondents indicating that they would
succumb to such 'pressure'.In view of the responses to the work-mix section of the survey,
the authors suggest that the highly publicised initiatives and
investigations at national, institutional and faculty level over
the previous 15 months created a greater awareness of the
importance of engaging in research activity. Furthermore, no non-IT
staff chose 'research only' in 2001 or 2002. There was little
change in IT staff's choice of work mix including some research.
Only IT staff chose the 'research only' work mix as first choice in
April 2002. No non-IT person chose a 'research-only' work mix.
Almost all IT staff chose work-mixes that included some research,
both in January 2001 and April 2002. Perhaps this indicates a
latent urge to be research-active.Further analysis of the results from the other sections of the
questionnaire is still to be done. The issuing of the questionnaire
has stimulated some debate within Cape Technikon and outside. The
questionnaire, with appropriate tuning, could be applied to other
faculties and disciplines at Cape Technikon, and to sister
institutions in the Western Cape Province and nationally. The
number of respondents has been small, reflecting the size of
Faculty academic staff. A longitudinal study should be possible in
a year to estimate any further shifts to or from research activity.
More sophisticated statistical analysis would be relevant when the
number of respondents increases, especially correlation and factor
analysis.},
