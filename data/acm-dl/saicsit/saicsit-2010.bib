abstract = {Usability, which is generally defined in terms of application effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction, is one of the focus areas of human-computer interaction (HCI). Accessibility is the design of systems that can be perceived, understood and used by people with varying abilities. Although accessibility concerns are aimed at making systems usable for people with disabilities, support for direct accessibility, the built-in redundancies in an application that enable as many people as possible to utilize it without system modifications, is beneficial to people with or without disabilities. Different usability evaluation methods (UEMs) are available. Selecting between the various methods can be influenced by the type of system being evaluated. The Digital Doorway (DD), a non-standard computer system deployed to promote computer literacy amongst underprivileged communities in South Africa, was evaluated using the heuristic evaluation method and a field usability study. The heuristic evaluation method revealed a large number of usability and direct accessibility-related problems, some of which could be classified as low-severity problems. The field study showed additional problems that affected the successful completion of user tasks. Since a number of these were a direct consequence of the context of use, they were not recognized as problems by expert evaluators. The study showed that the heuristic evaluation method can be optimized by complementing it with another method that involves user participation and is, preferably, carried out in the intended context of use.},

abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) practitioners are often located in the social sciences branch of Information Systems (IS). Practitioner research comprises of research that practitioners undertake with a view to the advancement of their practice. A question arises in respect of research conducted by ICT practitioners: does practitioner-based inquiry research have a theoretical base and does practitioner-based inquiry research challenge enlightenment presuppositions based upon an empiricist epistemology? The probing and discussion of this question is the objective of this paper.In this paper, ICT practitioner-based inquiry research in organisations is discussed. Some philosophical underpinnings of practitioner-based inquiry research are probed and a reflection on practitioner-inquiry research is given. It is suggested that actively participating ICT practitioners in the IS research domain are a necessity in the workplace environment but their participation requires that the actual context in which IS practices are conducted, should be analysed. To ensure that such IS research is valid, an epistemological base is needed, for critical reflection and thoughtful action from which to draw.},

Extracting such annotations from raw fiction text is a laborious process and so in this work we evaluate appropriate candidates to serve as the basis for the required annotations for generating interactive virtual worlds. We validate our choice by generating adventure games: interactive virtual worlds which create a stylized representation of the environment described in the text, populate it with characters related to the story and define game goals related to the plot of the fiction story.Our prototype produces a fully playable game, making use of an existing open-source game engine. The process is evaluated using user tests in which participants are asked to measure the accuracy with which the game represents the events, characters and goals described in the story. The response indicates that the chosen annotation set is sufficient to define a game that is a plausibly acceptable representation of the text.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore components that influence the Mobile User Experience (MEX) in a mlearning interaction through a review of relevant literature. The application of mobile cellular technology in education has been the focus of the emerging domain of mlearning, and has, through numerous pilots and initiatives, been shown as having the potential to overcome several barriers experienced in education. This potential is, however counterbalanced by studies that show the relative high dropout rate and non-use for learners using a diverse array of electronic learning systems when compared to the traditional face-to-face classroom interactions. The learners as end-users often indicate a frustration with the technology as a major obstacle for the use and participation in technology enhanced learning systems. Moreover, organizations are increasingly requiring evidence that technology enhanced learning systems and programs will be widely accepted and utilized before implementing them. This paper explores and documents the components that would impact on the phenomena within a discourse between the technology affordances and domain requirements as revealed by the literature in the domains of mlearning and Mobile Human Computer Interaction (MHCI).},

abstract = {Monitoring systems are necessary for the management of anything beyond the smallest networks of computers. While specialised monitoring systems can be deployed to detect specific problems, more general systems are required to detect unexpected issues, and track performance trends.While large fleets of computers are becoming more common, few existing, general monitoring systems have the capability to scale to monitor these very large networks. There is also an absence of systems in the literature that cater for visualisation of monitoring information on a large scale.Scale is an issue in both the design and presentation of large-scale monitoring systems. We discuss Panopticon, a monitoring system that we have developed, which can scale to monitor tens of thousands of nodes, using only commodity equipment. In addition, we propose a novel method for visualising monitoring information on a large scale, based on general techniques for visualising massive multi-dimensional datasets.The monitoring system is shown to be able to collect information from up to 100 000 nodes. The storage system is able to record and output information from up to 25 000 nodes, and the visualisation is able to simultaneously display all this information for up to 20 000 nodes. Optimisations to our storage system could allow it to scale a little further, but a distributed storage approach combined with intelligent filtering algorithms would be necessary for significant improvements in scalability.},

In this paper we develop a framework which embodies a 4-way validation strategy to develop and measure a specification against requirements from users, the application domain, restrictions in the notation and language and finally the operational system, obtained through appropriate refinement. Our framework is modelled on Boehm's spiral model and at each iteration of the spiral, the specification is validated in line with the evolving requirements of each of the above four aspects. The process continues until convergence is reached and no further amendments are made to the specification during a subsequent iteration. For each of the four aspects, a sequence of processes is defined to facilitate the validation of the specification from the viewpoint presented by the relevant aspect. The utility of our framework is illustrated through a case study in Object Z.},

abstract = {Economic activities in rural areas of developing countries are usually not strong enough to impact significantly in poverty alleviation and improve rural life. These communities are often marginalized in terms of basic infrastructures; low economic activities and limited markets. However, they possess market potentials in agriculture and micro-enterprises. Information and communication technologies can be use to develop these potentials by opening these markets beyond the local borders. Our objective is to explore the potentials of information technologies for rural economy development by bringing mobile added value to potential users. Our aim is to design a mobile user interface that will be easy to use by rural micro-entrepreneurs who have little or no previous experience of the mobile commerce technology. In order to design the application and user interface, we conducted a case study in Dwesa community and applied user-centered design methods in the design process. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to gather user data. This paper presents the design process, and user evaluation of the prototype mobile user interface. The user evaluation of the prototype was conducted and the descriptive statistics of users' performance is presented. The result shows that the evaluators who had no prior experience with this technology recorded minimum tasks completion time and with few errors, and an increasing level of precision in task performance as they continue to use the interface; which is a positive indication on the usability of the user-interface.},

abstract = {This paper investigates mobile phone adoption by older adults to better understand this user group's current level of adoption and to assess how well existing adoption models capture the acceptance levels of elderly users. The rationale is that mobile technology is continually improving and despite efforts to address their needs, this section of the population is known to be a largely untapped market.Data was captured on mobile phone usage of a sample of 46 users aged 60 to 87 through observation, a questionnaire and informal interviews. Using mostly qualitative and some quantitative data analysis techniques, the participants' levels of acceptance of the technology were determined and related to their age, how they acquired the phone, how long they have owned it, how often they use it and which functions they use.Our findings indicate that most participants in the sample have not reached full adoption but have not rejected the technology either. We found that a significant number of users stagnate in a phase of limited use with no inclination towards full adoption or complete rejection. This is contrary to the adoption presented by existing models that assume a user will reach a point of either rejection or acceptance of the technology. Therefore we conclude that existing technology and mobile phone adoption models do not adequately capture the mobile phone adoption patterns of the elderly. We have thus established the need to reconsider mobile phone adoption models. Furthermore, we have identified the specific age, the length of ownership, and the manner in which the phone was acquired as good predictors of where a user will end on the acceptance-rejection scale.},

abstract = {There are several sources that indicate a remarkable increase in the adoption of open source software (OSS) into the technology infrastructure of organizations. In fact, the number of medium to large organizations without some OSS installations, is surprisingly low. This move to open source (OS), as well as the obvious advantages thereof, have motivated the CSIR of South Africa to investigate the adoption of OSS across the institution for all aspects of its operations. In launching this endeavor, it became apparent that there are very limited resources available, locally or internationally, that documented process related information about organizational OS migrations. This lack of information provides the motivation for this research that investigates the use of process reference models to capture the process related information for an organization wide migration from proprietary software to OSS. In order to develop the necessary process reference models, the specific process models for the CSIR OS migration were captured, and, using a repeatable method based on reference model criteria, the generic process reference models for an organizational OS migration were extracted and documented. It is our firm belief that these process reference models would provide a baseline for the processes needed when any organization considers open source adoption or organization-wide OS migration.},

abstract = {The SASL project at the University of the Western Cape is in the process of creating a machine translation system on mobile phones that can automate the translation process between English and South African Sign Language (SASL). This will supplement the use of highly trained interpreters that are expensive and scarce. In order to do this it is necessary to determine whether or not sign language visualization on mobile phones is feasible. This paper describes the research carried out in order to determine the feasibility of four sign language visualization methods on mobile phones. Three factors were considered: the intelligibility; the bandwidth consumption; and the power consumption associated with each method, with the intelligibility being the most important factor. Three of these methods were synthetic sign language visualization methods. It was found that, on average, 65% of signs were recognizable. This figure was affected by sign language dialect variations and increased to 85% with this factor removed. On average, the animations of methods were found to have file sizes of 162 KB and caused a 180% increase in power consumption, compared to the idle operation, on the mobile phone.},

PDB is an important source of information about structural and other properties of proteins, and it currently contains about 65000 protein structures. Determining which proteins have particular shapes is an important bioinformatics application. PH2 parses each PDB file, creates a SQL database for it and then performs the appropriate queries. Experiments performed on a small local cluster and a large shared cluster show that the application is highly-scalable.

These devices, however, have several design constraints including limited screen space and hardware capabilities. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) have been proposed to address these issues but have not been extensively applied to mobile tourist guides. Little research has been conducted into identifying the potential benefits of AUIs for mobile tourist guides. This paper discusses the design of A-POInter, an adaptive version of an existing mobile tourist guide. The results of an international field study of A-POInter are presented and compared to the results of an earlier field study that was used to determine a set of adaptation requirements for A-POInter. The results showed that incorporating an AUI into a mobile tourist guide can provide several usability benefits and also validated the adaptation requirements.},

These applications have proven the potential of mobile technologies for improving the quality of health care service in general and the fight against HIV/AIDS in particular. However, to achieve greater impact on the ground level (e.g. in an antiretroviral (ARV) treatment clinic) in a developing country's context, these applications have to be adopted and their utilization sustained. A study was undertaken to investigate sustainability and scalability challenges of mobile phone-based applications/projects for HIV/AIDS care in developing countries and the adoption and sustainability prospects of such m-Health applications in an ARV clinic in Pretoria. The findings presented here, are that from a care givers' and patients' perspective, adoption and sustainability of these applications is not merely dependent on the proposed technology's capabilities to enhance service delivery. Adoption and sustainability is however, mostly dependant on: (1) the care givers and patients' willingness and capability to incur any technological adoption and continuous use costs and, (2) their pre-conceived notions of government or sponsor-supported service provision.},

abstract = {User expertise and skill affects the way users interact with software. It is envisaged that an adaptive user interface (AUI) which dynamically changes from a novice user interface (UI) to an expert UI could possibly improve users' performance. Contact centres (CCs), are the primary interaction point between a company and its customers and an important challenge is to increase the speed at which contact centre agents (CCAs) retrieve information to answer customer queries. CCAs however have different capabilities, experience and expertise. Studies have provided empirical support that user performance can be increased when the computer UI characteristics match the user skill level. As a result, software systems have to become more individualised and cater for different users. This research focuses on applying this concept of AUIs to the domain of CCs and investigates whether an AUI for CCAs could improve the CCA's performance and enhance their interaction with UI. The main aim of this research study was to propose a model for AUIs which could be applied to the domain of CCs. The implementation of the proposed model was completed as proof of concept and the model was evaluated. The results indicate that the proposed AUI model significantly improves CCAs' performance and most users were satisfied with the adaptation provided by the model.},

abstract = {The Information Technology (IT) subject presented in South African secondary schools is considered to be a difficult subject. The programming component of IT is believed to be the main cause of this difficulty. Learners who struggle with programming are unable to obtain above average marks in IT, as the programming component has the largest weighting in the IT subject framework. The aim of the research upon which this paper is based is to identify factors related to learner achievement in programming and the IT subject. The two areas that this paper investigates are learner motivation towards programming and the learning preferences of IT learners. The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) is used to determine learner motivation and the Visual, Aural, Read/Write and Kinesthetic (VARK) Questionnaire is used to determine the learning preferences of IT learners. Both questionnaires provide interesting results and observations. The self-efficacy for learning and performance and control of learning beliefs motivational subscales seem to influence the performance of learners at the different schools. The VARK questionnaire results for this study indicate that the learning preferences of IT learners may influence understanding of programming concepts and also that it is best to present content to IT learners using a balance between all four modal groups (visual, aural, read/write and kinesthetic) to ensure that the learning preferences of all learners are met. The findings of this research indicate the impact that motivation and learning preferences possibly have on the understanding of programming concepts and overall achievement in programming and the IT subject. The contribution of this paper is the identification of the MSLQ and VARK questionnaires as methods that can be used to improve teaching strategies in South African secondary schools.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the move from philosophical ontology to information systems ontologies. Ontology has traditionally been (and still is) a philosophical discipline that studies the nature of existence. In a certain time and philosophical era, there usually was only one correct or current ontology. The plural of this word did not exist, which explains the fact that academics who were trained in philosophy are often startled when they hear the plural of the word ontology for the first time. Yet, in the world of information systems, many practitioners use the plural as one of the most natural things to do. Although the term ontology has been borrowed by Information Systems from philosophy, it has been given a slightly different meaning. However, the two uses of the word are still historically and logically related. The author believes that the shift -- from singular to plural -- was made possible by the postmodern era that we live in. Like reality, knowledge and understanding have become fluid. Software development, too, did not escape the philosophical shift from modernism to postmodernism. Indeed, one may also regard the creation of information systems ontologies in a positive way as the endeavours of academics to embrace the multifaceted nature of reality by representing subsets of it. On the other hand, the danger of formal ontologies is that, although they are meant to mirror and capture reality, ontology-based software could create hyperrealities that become more real than reality because it is typical of postmodernism that real life phenomena are replaced by representations.},

abstract = {Many problems in the world exists where it is necessary to compare a given implementation with a specification and provide some quantification as to whether the implementation complies with the specification. An example of such a problem is determining whether a given curriculum complies with a specification as stipulated by a professional body such as the ACM/IEEE curriculum for Computing.In order to provide a mechanism for quantification, an algorithm is proposed that builds a new model. The new model is built in terms of the specification by making use of the contents of the implementation thereby ensuring that there is no loss of implementation data.Quantification with regards to the compliance of the implementation to the specification is provided by the proposed compliance measure. The measure comprises a suite of metrics with which the specification, implementation and the new model may be compared, resulting in a management tool for model improvement. A size-based metric of the compliance measure is proposed.},

abstract = {Small Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have become active instruments for poverty alleviation, employment generation as well as economic and social development. However, SMMEs in developing countries operate under effervescent business environments characterised by high inflation rates, poor technology infrastructure, lack of business expertise and resources. There is a need for these organisations to strategically align their business processes for them to adapt and survive in the operating environment turbulence. There are dozens of application software designed specifically to support SMME business processes on the market. On the contrary, software developers pay little attention to the user experience and usability aspects of their products resulting in the packages falling short on overall usability. Highly usable applications improve users' productivity, satisfaction and service quality delivery. Hence SMMEs in developing countries should implement software tools with usable user interfaces. Considering the applications' usability failure it becomes vital to research the user experiences of a typical accounting tool commonly used in developing countries' SMMEs. This paper proposes evaluation metrics that are applicable to evaluate the User Experience (UX) of a chosen accounting tool commonly used in developing countries. The paper introduces a brief background on the current situation in typical developing countries' SMMEs. A discussion on the accounting tools used in SMMEs operating in developing countries follows with a definition of UX, its facets and evaluation methods. Evaluation results on the UX of Pastel accounting, Xpress 2009 is presented. The paper culminates with metrics proposed to evaluate the user experience of accounting tools and proposes future work to improve on the proposed metrics.},

abstract = {The rapid growth and development of wireless communication services and applications corresponds to an increase in associated energy consumption. For broadband wireless network deployment in rural areas affected by unreliability and unavailability of national grid electricity supply, energy efficiency becomes a major design criterion to be considered. In such areas, diesel powered generators are normally used as the main power source, while batteries become the most preferred source of energy to power wireless communication devices. In order to address increasing energy requirements, we propose an energy saving technique for mobile stations (MSs) operating under the wireless broadband access systems in this paper. Our proposed scheme is limited to the power saving class (PSC) of Type I in IEEE 802.16. Our numerical results show that more energy can be saved if the listening interval is considered under non-sleep or awake mode.},

In a multilingual country such as South Africa where English is not the first language of most citizens, the need to address this issue is critical when building speech-based systems. In this project we trained two sets of hidden Markov Models for isolated word English speech. The first set of models was trained with native English speakers and the second set was trained with non-native speakers from a representative sample of major South African accent groups. We compared the recognition accuracies of the two sets of models and found that the models trained with accented English performed better.

If people were motivated to play the game, without external motivation from an organisation, then these people would also be motivated to learn about information security. Therefore, a secondary aim of this game was to be self-motivating. An experiment was conducted in order to test whether or not these aims were met.The experiment was conducted on a play test group and a control group. The play test group played the game before completing a questionnaire, while the control group, simply, completed the questionnaire. This paper discusses the research design of the experiment and also provides an initial analysis of the results. The game design will be discussed which also provides guidelines for future game designers to follow.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems are becoming more popular today because of the wide area of applications. It is being used in several industries such as the transport industry, sports, medical and government institutions. Its advantages such as the capacity to store more information than other identification technologies as well as the ease with which data can be read (since it doesn't require line of sight and human intervention), have sparked its widespread use and implementation in the various industries.The most widely used class of RFID tags is the class 1 tag because it offers identification functionality at low cost. Class 1 tags have limited computational power and memory resources. Due to these limitations, common authentication protocols such as AES cannot be implemented on the class 1 tags. As these tags provide essential implementation capabilities for development countries such as South Africa, it is vital that researchers focus on providing adequate security solutions. Taking into account the information security needs and performance limitations of the class 1 tags, we present a lightweight protocol based on the Hopper and Blum's human authentication protocol.},

abstract = {An important challenge facing e-Science is the development of scalable systems and analysis techniques that allow client applications to locate data and services in increasingly large-scale distributed environments. e-Science Systems should achieve three main goals: (i) efficient and selective processing of data, (ii) support network collaboration without clogging distribution networks; and (iii) allow transparency of experiments through repeatability and verifiability of experiments. Several systems have addressed limited combinations of these properties, but we address all three in this work. We describe the architecture and implementation of such a framework in Astro-WISE, an astronomical approach to distributed data processing, discovery and retrieval of datasets that achieves scalability via dynamic linking (data lineage) maintained within the system. We show that lineage data collected during the processing and analysis of datasets can be reused to perform selective reprocessing(at sub-image level)ondatasets while the remainder of the dataset is untouched, a rather difficult process to automate without lineage.},

abstract = {Previous work on implementations of FA-based string recognizers suggested a range of implementation strategies (and therefore, algorithms) aiming at improving their performance for fast string recognition. However, an efficient exploitation of suggested algorithms by domain-specific FA-implementers requires prior knowledge of the behaviour (performance-wise) of each algorithm in order to make an informed choice. We propose a unified framework for frequently evaluating existing FA-based string recognizers such that FA-implementers could capture appropriate problem domains that guarantee an optimal performance of available recognizers. The suggested framework takes into consideration factors such as the kind of automaton being processed, the string and alphabet size as well as the overall behaviour of the automaton at run-time. It also forms the basis for further work on FA-based string recognition applications in specific computational domains such as natural language processing, computational biology, natural and computer virus scanning, network intrusion detection, etc. It is well-known that performance remains a significant bottleneck to the high-performance solutions required in such industrial applications.},

abstract = {In the domain of network security, packet filtering for classification purposes is of significant interest. Packet classification provides a mechanism for understanding the composition of packet streams arriving at distinct network interfaces, and is useful in diagnosing threats and uncovering vulnerabilities so as to maximise data integrity and system security. Traditional packet classifiers, such as PCAP, have utilised Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) in representing filter sets, due to both their amenability to optimisation, and their inherent structural applicability to the metaphor of decision-based classification. Unfortunately, CFGs do not map well to cooperative processing implementations, and single-threaded CPU-based implementations have proven too slow for real-time classification against multiple arbitrary filters on next generation networks. In this paper, we consider a novel multithreaded classification algorithm, optimised for execution on GPU co-processors, intended to accelerate classification throughput and maximise processing efficiency in a highly parallel execution context.},

The most optimal heuristic combination found by the search is used to construct the examination timetable. The focus of a hyper-heuristic is to generalize well rather than producing the best result for one or more problem sets in the domain. A metaheuristic such as evolutionary algorithms is usually employed to explore the heuristic space. This study reports on an empirical investigation conducted to test how the structure of the heuristic combination affects the success of the search of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) hyper-heuristic for the uncapacitated examination timetabling problem. Two structures, namely, one that combines low-level construction heuristics linearly, and applies them sequentially and a second which combines heuristics hierarchically and applies them simultaneously are investigated. The performance of the EA-based hyper-heuristic using both structures is tested on a set of eight uncapacitated examination timetabling problems. The study has revealed that the representation used does have an impact on the success of the evolutionary algorithm. In this domain the linear combination and sequential application of heuristics produced better results. The EAs with both representations were also found to perform better than other hyper-heuristic methods applied to the same problem.},

In the analysis the experiences of women and the context of the international IT industry is taken into consideration. The authors furthermore investigate what attracts women in South Africa to the IT industry. Data was collected and analysed from women working in the IT industry in South Africa by means of an anonymous online questionnaires consisting of open- and close-ended questions. The authors critically challenge the results from the interpretive analysis. This study can be used to gain more insight and understanding of the current situation in South Africa, but it can also contribute to communities such as feminists, academia, practitioners or governments in the creation of an emancipation theory or a series of interventions to improve the situation for women in the South African IT industry.},

In this paper we compare how children and adults learn to use an unfamiliar computer game to determine whether learnability has different meanings across generations. We recorded eye tracking data while users taught themselves to play a computer game. Comparison of the on-screen focus points and eye gazing patterns showed that adults and children have different tactics when confronted with an unfamiliar game. It revealed aspects of software interfaces that adults and children approach differently. For example, children will focus on the game elements and use a trial-and-error approach instead of reading on-screen instructions, while adults are more willing to interrupt game play to read the instructions. The knowledge gained through this research will help designers to distinguish between the needs of users in different age groups and improve the learnability of their products.},

abstract = {Studies have recommended usability criteria for evaluating Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. However these criteria do not provide sufficient qualitative information regarding the behaviour of users when interacting with the user interface of these systems. A triangulation technique, including the use of time diaries, can be used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research for providing additional qualitative data that cannot be accurately collected by experimental or even observation means alone.Limited studies have been performed on the use of time diaries in a triangulation approach as an HCI research method for the evaluation of the usability of ERP systems. This paper reports on a case study where electronic time diaries were used in conjunction with other HCI research methods, namely, surveys and usability questionnaires, in order to evaluate the usability of an ERP system. The results of the study show that a triangulation technique including the use of time diaries is a rich and useful method that allows more flexibility for respondents and can be used to help understand user behaviour when interacting with ERP systems. A thematic analysis of the qualitative data collected from the time diaries validated the quantitative data and highlighted common problem areas encountered during typical tasks performed with the ERP system. An improved understanding of user behaviour enabled the redesign of the tasks performed during the ERP learning process and could provide guidance to ERP designers for improving the usability and ease of learning of ERP systems.},

abstract = {In-car communication systems (ICCS) are becoming a common feature in today's cars, however they can cause distraction due to usability issues and competition for driver attention. Several multimodal interfaces have been designed and implemented using speech in order to allocate the driver's hands and eyes solely to the driving task. A lack of feedback and flexibility in some ICCS still contributes to increasing the cognitive load of the driver and negatively affecting the user experience. This paper discusses the design and evaluation of MIMI (Multimodal Interface for Mobile Info-communication), a multimodal prototype that was designed to address the usability issues with existing ICCS. Several communication tasks were evaluated using the following metrics: time on task, task completion, workload, flexibility, error prevention and feedback. Results obtained show high rates of perceived usability in terms of time on task and task completion rates due to the flexibility, feedback and error prevention provided by MIMI. The results show that multimodal input can contribute to preventing errors; however commands where speech input cannot be combined with manual input (e.g. dictating a phone number), are still negatively affected by speech recognition errors.},

abstract = {Map-based applications are becoming standard features of most smart phones. Keypad and touch-screen interaction have traditionally been used to interact with maps on mobile phones, but both these interaction techniques have several shortcomings. Tilt interaction offers an alternative approach with several advantages. Tilt interaction is intuitive and can be performed one-handed. Previous research has shown that tilt interaction offers equivalent or inferior results in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and preference. Similar studies have offered limited insight into the comparative performance of tilt and keypad interaction. This paper discusses the development and comparative evaluation of a prototype mobile map-based application supporting both keypad and tilt interaction. The results of this evaluation showed that keypad interaction was more efficient for tasks requiring precise selection, but that tilt interaction offered greater perceived controllability, efficiency and ease of use for navigation tasks.},

abstract = {Eliciting and analyzing requirements within knowledge systems, which fundamentally differ so far from technology supported systems represent particular challenges. African rural communities' life is deeply rooted in an African Indigenous knowledge system manifested in their practices such as Traditional Medicine. We describe our endeavors to elicit requirements to design a system to support the accumulation and sharing of traditional local knowledge within two rural Herero communities in Namibia. We show how our method addressed various challenges in eliciting and depicting intangible principles arising because African communities do not dichotomize theoretical and practical know-how or privilege a science of abstraction and generalization. Ethnography provided insights into etiology, or causal interrelationships between social values, spiritual elements and everyday life. Participatory methods, involving youth and elders, revealed nuances in social relations and pedagogy pertinent to the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation. Researcher and participant-recorded audio-visual media revealed that interactions prioritize speech, gesture and bodily interaction, above visual context. Analysis of the performed and narrated structures reveal some of the ways that people tacitly transfer bodily and felt-experiences and temporal patterns in storytelling. Experiments using digital and paper-based media, in situ rurally showed the ways that people in rural settings encounter and learn within their everyday experiences of the land. These analyses also demonstrate that own ontological and representational biases can constrain eliciting local meanings and analyzing transformations in meaning as we introduce media. Reflections on our method are of value to others who need to elicit requirements in communities whose literacy, social and spiritual logic and values profoundly differ from those in the knowledge systems that typify ICT design.},

A variety of situations can cause these image degradations: sensor motion, environmental conditions and random noise. A crucial procedure in computer vision is the assessment and quantification of digital image quality. A numerical score for describing image quality is useful for a number of applications, some of which include improving the performance of an image acquisition system and adaptive algorithms. We present an intuitive quality metric for characterizing the amount of blur in an image, through blind image assessment, using the Haar discrete wavelet transform. Thus, the method does not require a reference image or any prior information. The novelty of our method lies in processing the image derivative using the discrete wavelet transform rather than directly processing image intensity values as is traditionally done. We present late breaking results and analysis for a small set of data. The proposed method shows promise for a large number of avenues such as realtime blur level assessment and image depth of focus estimation.},

Secondly, GUIDE analyses field groupings and performable actions in the GUI to infer the underlying database structure and the data manipulation operations.The GUI analysis approach is validated by means of a proof of concept case study. The creation of a simple information system using the GUIDE prototype is presented. The main result of the case study is a confirmation that the proposed approach can be successfully applied in system development. Secondly, this pilot study indicates that a significant amount of development time can be saved by using GUIDE.},

abstract = {What constitutes busyness? When is a person busy? When is one person busier than another person? These are questions that C3TO attempts to answer when assigning tutors to pupils in a mobile, online tutoring environment. C3TO (Chatter Call Centre/Tutoring Online) is a platform which allows school pupils to use Mxit or any XMPP chat protocol on their cell phones to reach tutors for assistance with school homework problems. "Dr Math" is one of the services hosted on C3TO where primary and secondary school pupils link up with university students for help with their mathematics homework.From ongoing experience, it has been found that a mathematics tutor can handle at most 50 pupils per hour using C3TO. The platform supports tutors connecting via the Internet using traditional workstations while pupils connect using GPRS or 3G using a chat protocol on their cell phones. Because there are always substantially more pupils needing help with mathematics homework than there are available tutors, a busyness model needed to be developed so that new pupils asking questions could be assigned to the least busy tutor in order to share the tutoring load equitably among the tutors currently online.This paper discusses the original busyness model which was implemented during prior versions of "Dr Math" and the problems which it encountered. The paper will then describe the current busyness model and how it is implemented in C3TO.},

In an attempt to solve these issues two methods of training data generation are considered namely; manual identification and automated generation. The manual technique considers heuristics for finding network incidents while the automated technique considers building simulated data sets using existing models of virus propagation and malicious activity. An example artificial intelligence system is then constructed using these marked datasets.},

Therefore most research has only focussed on the user's learning preferences and training via the "normal" auditory-visual channels. In this paper it is shown how a user model can be determined that includes the learning style, learning preference, abilities and the various available computing modalities. The model further incorporates how each of the elements influence each other. Such a model can be trained and expanded to allow for different training paradigms.},

This feature is unique to numberplates and therefore provides an excellent starting point in detecting numberplates. The second segmentation focuses on the region of interest provided by the first segmentation.

abstract = {Drought is the most complex and least understood of all natural disasters and it affects more people than any other hazard. Droughts have become synonymous with the developing countries and in particular the Sub-Saharan Africa where the hazard is chronic. Effects of droughts can be mitigated if accurate and timely drought predications were to be done. Unfortunately, despite the enormous advancements in science, predictions only provide indications of trends. A major weakness of the existing tools is the emphasis on macro/international level information. The tools also tend to ignore the at risk community who happen to be host to very crucial traditional knowledge on droughts. In this paper, we propose an integrated drought predication framework that considers both scientific and traditional knowledge and combines the use of mobile phones with wireless sensor networks to be able to capture and relay micro drought parameters. The framework is an enhancement of ITU's Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) Layers. In order to accommodate the diverse roles mobile phones play in our framework, Layer 2 (USN Access Networking) is implemented using three sub-layers composed of heterogeneous gateways.},

abstract = {Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are increasingly being developed for under-resourced languages, especially for use in multilingual spoken dialogue systems. We investigate different approaches to the acoustic modelling of Sepedi affricates for ASR. We determine that it is possible to model various of these complex consonants as a sequence of much simpler sounds. This approach reduces the Sepedi phoneme inventory from 45 to 32, resulting in simpler dictionary development and transcription processes, as well as more accurate acoustic modelling.},

abstract = {Semantic Web Services are touted as one possible solution for some of the challenges experienced with Web services; such as lack of automatic service discovery and consumption. Ideally, semantic services are meant to facilitate automatic business service provisioning and consumption on the Web. These services are enriched with semantics, which are derived from ontologies. Nevertheless, semantic-based services are scarcely adopted and utilised by service providers and consumers respectively. Some of the reasons noted in literature for this lack of adoption and usage include issues such as lack of real-life prototypes that are meant to demonstrate the benefits of semantic services; lack of integrated service creation frameworks; and unified development platforms that are purported to guide and promote simple engineering of semantic services. Thus, in this short paper our aim is on the proposal and presentation of a conceptual multi-layered and yet integrated service creation framework called iSemServ. The framework is intended to guide, simplify, and accelerate the process of engineering intelligent semantic services.},

abstract = {Several technological initiatives have been, and will continue to be implemented across the world to tackle the major barriers in bridging the digital divide. These include the use of Internet and other ICTs. This is seen as a gigantic step in the alleviation of the different paramount social-economic problems, at the same time, in the transformation of the society and realization of a truly free and democratic world society. The use of technology in bridging this gap is a fundamental advancement because it also brings with it a mutual understanding and elimination of differential powers within communities in both developing and developed countries worldwide. This paper describes how different wireless access technologies can be combined and deployed to facilitate a continuous flow of information, in and out of the marginalized areas in developing countries. It further explains again, the major role of having Internet connectivity in these areas and how it's seen as an improvement in successfully deployment of ICT4D activities. Different technologies such as WiFi, WiMAX and VSAT will be explored and discussed for the best wireless deployment configurations for the Siyakhula Living Lab (SLL). SLL was chosen as our test bed and it is located in Dwesa Community. This is one of the deep marginalized rural communities in South Africa found in the Eastern Cape Region.},

abstract = {The high school timetabling problem differs drastically from one school to another and from country to country. The South African high school problem has not been researched. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this problem for a particular high school. A two-phase approach is taken. The first phase uses a GA to evolve a timetable that meets the hard constraints of the problem. During the second phase a GA improves the quality of the solutions found during the first phase by reducing the soft constraint cost of the timetable. Domain knowledge, in the form of low-level construction heuristics, is used to guide the search during the first phase. The study experiments with the effect of using different low-level construction heuristics for this purpose. Each GA iteratively refines an initial population from one generation to the next by the processes of evaluation, selection and regeneration. The paper also reports on the performance of different mutation operators tested for regeneration.},

abstract = {The use of personal computing for internet access continues to grow and new applications and technologies continue to emerge. Mobile devices are starting to replace traditional computing devices (PCs and laptops) as client devices, and must support growing, changing and emerging applications and technologies.However, new developments give birth to new challenges. Mobile applications are not exempt from these challenges. The issues include lack of memory, processing capabilities and storage on a mobile device, the reliability of connections, lack of available bandwidth, and poor security for wireless and mobile networks.This paper investigates the issues related to mobile technology and proposes an intelligent framework to assist file transfers to and from mobile devices. This paper shows that applying the framework reduces the total communication overhead and memory footprint, and decreases the transfer times for files sent between a client (mobile device) and a server.},

abstract = {Online digital repositories are rapidly becoming the norm to store various different forms of content, including academic documents and heritage collections. There are many advantages to online systems, including general accessibility and the increasing use of Web browsers as a platform. However, it can argued that, for the preservation of heritage, offline systems may offer other advantages, such as replication, simplicity and cost-effectiveness. This paper describes an attempt to exploit advantages of both approaches in the form of a combined online-offline digital repository, where some content is online on a Web server and other content is offline on a DVD-ROM. This new approach to designing systems for preservation and access is especially useful in areas with limited Internet bandwidth, such as in most African countries. Experimental results confirm that this system is effective and efficient.},

abstract = {It is axiomatic that a private Higher Education (HE) provider needs to focus on cost-effective and efficient ways to manage processes without compromising standards, quality and integrity. In order to ensure academic integrity, moderation of examinations is essential. Some of the challenges of the current system include a long turnaround period with regard to the moderation and return of scripts, high courier costs high printing volumes and the risks and costs involved in transporting original scripts.The private HE provider has therefore sought to find an alternative cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution to this question. The Faculty of Information Technology -- with the support of the moderators concerned -- became involved in a pilot study with reference to a proposed electronic moderation process.In this paper both the processes that worked, as well as those which did not, will be discussed. The outcome of the pilot study indicated that the proposed process definitely had a positive impact on the environment, budgetary limitations and security issues regarding examination scripts; it also allowed for better turnaround time of moderators' feedback and afforded moderators the opportunity to moderate at a time more convenient to themselves.},
