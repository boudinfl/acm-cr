abstract = {In this paper we present Artemis, a tool to analyse Java bytecode and discover run-time errors. Artemis uses the method of symbolic execution to perform path-sensitive analysis on compiled Java classes, in the process building up constraints under which errors like null pointer dereferences and division-by-zero errors can occur. During the analysis, many warnings for possible errors may occur, but not all paths leading to these warnings are feasible. Artemis uses an external decision procedure---a constraint solver---to decide the feasibility of paths, and only if a path is feasible does it generate a JUnit test case for that path. It signals the possibility of a real error only if a test case manages to detect an expected exception during an actual run by the JUnit core.Artemis allows control of the analysis in two important ways: (1) The depth to which method calls descend can be bounded, and (2) so can the number of times branch statements are executed over symbolic values.We performed an evaluation of a small set of non-trivial benchmarking tests, averaging 450 lines of code, and we concluded that using a call depth of one and branch bound of two is optimal for the discovery of bugs. Although Artemis was written as a Java-only solution, it was constructed so that the various components connect via interfaces. Therefore it is easy to extend, and we plan to explore, amongst others, different constraint solvers in the future.},

abstract = {Conceptual modeling is nowadays mostly done using languages such as Entity-Relationship (ER) Models, Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Object-Role Modeling (ORM). These models are used to depict the ontological organization of relevant concepts or entities. Such formalisms share a common modeling approach, based on the notions of class or entity and the relations or associations between classes or entities. Recent developments in knowledge representation using logic-based ontologies have created new possibilities for conceptual data modeling. It also raises the question of how existing conceptual models using ER, UML or ORM could be translated into Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that have proved to be particularly appropriate for formalizing ontologies and reasoning about them. Given a conceptual data model, two assumptions are usually made that are not explicitly stated but need to be clarified for its DL translation: (1) disjointness assumption: all the classes are to be assumed pairwise disjoint if not specified otherwise; and (2) covering assumption: the content of every class must correspond to the union of its immediate subclasses (this includes the assumption that we do not consider anything apart from what is expressed in the model). In this paper we propose two simple procedures to assist modelers with integrating these assumptions into their models, thereby allowing for a more complete translation into DLs.},

abstract = {The mining industry is constantly faced with the dual needs for safety and improved productivity. It is widely recognized that robots can play a significant role in pre-disaster (pre-emption) and post-disaster (recovery) mine rescue operations. This would inevitably enhance productivity and greatly reduce human exposure to dangerous underground mine environment. Nonetheless, the success of a robot in a mine depends greatly on its visual capability to correctly interpret its immediate environment for navigational purposes. This work serves to assist robots' drivability in an underground mine. A probabilistic approach based on the local entropy is employed. The entropy is measured within a fixed window on a stream of mine frames to compute features used in the segmentation process. We then compare results using the statistical region merging (SRM) approach and evaluate the performance to provide useful qualitative and quantitative conclusions. Different regions of the mine, such as the shaft, stope and gallery, are investigated and results show that a good drivable region can be detected in an underground mine environment.},

Two of the key drawbacks of this approach are the high communication overhead and the excessive growth of the queues that hold states received from other nodes, ultimately resulting in memory exhaustion that causes premature termination of the distributed enumeration algorithm. This paper investigates a number of strategies to reduce communication times and queue lengths. Some aspects of the strategies are novel, including a local search technique, while others are standard techniques for reducing memory usage and time for both serial and parallel state enumeration algorithms. The queue reduction strategies effectively reduce the queue lengths and save memory, while the standard techniques outperform the other strategies in their effectiveness to reduce communication overhead.},

The time-performance of each of these implemented variants was then compared against those of the well-known Horspool and Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithms, the latter being representative of the best-known pattern matchers currently available. Various data sets, pattern selections and pattern lengths were used, but the same Horspool-like shift tables were used throughout by the dead-zone variants. It was found that in some contexts variants of the dead zone algorithm compare very favourably against the Horspool and Boyer-Moore algorithms.},

abstract = {Classical reasoning for logic-based KR (Knowledge Representation) systems is in general, monotonic. That is, there is an assumption in these systems that there is complete information about a domain. This means that they generally cannot deal with any new information arising which contradicts with the current information. This is not an appropriate model for reasoning in many applications. Therefore, alternative non-monotonic systems have been investigated which can reason under uncertainty or with incomplete information. Defeasible reasoning is one particular model for implementing non-monotonic reasoning. It is concerned with representing and reasoning with defeasible (non-strict) facts about a domain. The defeasible counterpart of the strict fact: "All birds fly" is the defeasible fact: "Most birds fly" (or the alternative phrasing "Birds usually fly"). We discuss two approaches for defeasible reasoning in the family of logic-based KR languages known as Description Logics (DLs). They are applicable to particular extensions of DLs that allow for the statement of defeasible sentences similar to the aforementioned examples. The approaches are known as prototypical reasoning and presumptive reasoning and are both rooted in the notion of Rational Closure developed by Lehmann and Magidor for an extension of propositional logic. Here we recast their definitions in a DL context and define algorithms for prototypical and presumptive reasoning for DL knowledge bases (also called DL ontologies) that may contain defeasible sentences. In particular, we present a plug-in for the Prot\'{e}g\'{e} ontology editor which implements these algorithms for OWL ontologies - the Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a formal standard of languages whose semantic basis is identical to that of DLs. Our plug-in, RaMP, allows the modeller to indicate defeasible information in OWL ontologies and perform logical inferencing to determine what defeasible conclusions one can draw from these ontologies.},

This combination of multiple distance-based classification techniques achieved accuracy rate of 87.8%, which is comparable to a similar system that used Support Vector Machines, a supervised learning technique. Therefore, competitive levels of accuracy can be obtained using distance-based classification.},

The results of the code coverage calculation is then used to automatically generate JUnit test cases to reach areas of a program that are not sufficiently covered. The level of redundancy of each test case is also calculated during coverage calculation, thereby identifying fully redundant, and partially redundant, test cases.These calculations are packaged as an Eclipse plug-in, named ATCO. ATCO can also be used to perform coverage calculation during a manual execution of a program, allowing testers to measure the effectiveness of manual testing.},

abstract = {Parallelism in linear algebra libraries is a common approach to accelerate numerical and scientific applications. Matrix-matrix multiplication is one of the most widely used computations in scientific and numerical algorithms. Although a number of matrix multiplication algorithms exist for distributed memory environments (e.g., Cannon, Fox, PUMMA, SUMMA), matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms for shared memory and SMP architectures have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we present a fast matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm for multi-core and SMP architectures using the MapReduce framework. Memory-resident linear algebra algorithms suffer performance losses on modern multi-core architectures because of the increasing performance gap between the CPU and main memory. To allow such compute-intensive algorithms to exploit the full potential of the program's inherent instruction level parallelism, the adverse effect of the processor-memory performance gap should be minimized. We present a cache-sensitive MapReduce matrix multiplication algorithm that fully exploits memory bandwidth and minimize cache misses and conflicts. Our experimental results show that the two algorithms outperform existing matrix multiplication algorithms for shared-memory architectures such as those given in the Phoenix, PLASMA and LAPACK libraries.},

Using a couple of example programs we show that improved performance is possible using the proposed methodology.

Most of the focus has however been on programs manipulating integers, booleans, and references in object oriented programs. Recently researchers have started looking at programs that do lots of string processing; this is motivated by the popularity of the web and the risk that errors in such programs may lead to security violations. Attempts to extend symbolic execution to the domain of strings have mainly been divided into one of two camps: automata-based approaches and approaches based on efficient bitvector analysis. Here we investigate these two approaches in one setting: the symbolic execution framework of Java PathFinder. First we describe the implementations of both approaches and then do an extensive evaluation to show under what circumstances each approach performs well (or not so well). We also illustrate the usefulness of the symbolic execution of strings by finding errors in real-world examples.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to design a model of the factors affecting the decision of municipal councils of less developed countries (LDCs) to commit resources in preparation of the adoption of e-services. The proposed model was designed by identifying key general e-government adoption factors using a systematic literature review, by modeling these factors according to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and by defining a set of hypotheses for the application of the proposed model to municipal e-services in LDCs. This led to the hypothesis according to which the decision of LDCs' municipal councils to commit human resources and to engineer institutional arrangements in preparation of the adoption of e-services depends on: a) The ICT infrastructural capabilities of their municipalities. b) How these municipal councils intend to use e-government as a strategic tool towards the fulfillment of their mandate of improving the socio-politico and economic conditions of their municipal citizens. c) Their belief that they are being put under pressure to institute e-government as the tool of excellence or norm for the running of municipal affairs. Such pressure may come from their interaction with their citizens, from national and global challenges beyond their control, or from constraints inherent to their political ideology. The proposed model can be used for the engineering of decision support systems to help municipal councils make investment decisions in preparation of the adoption of e-government especially in the context of LDCs. Futhermore, its originality lies on its focus on factors affecting the preparatory stage of e-services adoption.},

abstract = {Expatriate research has indicated that expatriate adjustment is a complex problem given that factors such as the influence of the spouse, cultural training/understanding, fluency in the host language and personality or emotional readiness of the expatriate are key. Considering these challenges in a culturally diverse environment such as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) provides a setting for an interesting study. The on-going PhD study concerning how expatriates use the Internet to adapt to KSA has proposed a theoretical model derived by following Glaser's Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM). This paper will report on a specific aspect of this proposed model namely the substantive category "degree of isolation" that references the expatriates the most. In line with the principles of the GTM extant literature were surveyed when the proposed theory reached maturity. This paper describes how the theory of Sense of Community (SOC) was chosen and applied to explain how expatriates, living in compounds in KSA, make sense of the degree of isolation experienced as it addressed the multifaceted nature of isolation as defined by this study.},

However, there is surprisingly high resistance to e-Learning in corporate training environments. The purpose of this study is to examine the literature on factors that may contribute to this resistance, also in South Africa. We present the corporate e-Learning environment as an activity system and analyse existing adoption literature using the six elements of Activity Theory. In this way, a holistic understanding is obtained of contributing factors towards adoption of e-Learning in corporate environments.},

A central repository is used to allow fast and easy access for relevant stakeholders, and we demonstrate how this repository can be used together with GIS data to create powerful crime mapping tools. While still in the early phases we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution through implementation of prototypes and isolated studies of core modules in the architecture and a first iteration of the interface design based on interviews with stakeholders in the organization and analysis of the current workflows.},

abstract = {A educational computer game, Conveyor, was designed and developed as part of an investigation into the use of games to teach software development at a tertiary level. The puzzle game requires players to sort random input objects of particular shapes and colours into the correct outputs by programming the solution. An integrated analytics system collects data about how players engage with the game, such as the time taken and number of reattempts at each level. The game was tested on a group of 39 electrical engineering and game design students, many of whom had not programmed before. 80% of participants completed all 9 levels of the game. The minimum average time for a level was around 20 seconds with an average of 2 attempts, whilst the most difficult level took an average of 7 minutes over 3 attempts to complete. These results indicate that the game provided a good, but not overwhelming, challenge for the desired audience. A survey was used to collect qualitative feedback from the audience. The game was judged to be both fun and rewarding, but is too instructive and the user interface was deemed confusing. Further work conducted includes a simple test before and after the game is played, to judge the effect of the game on students' understanding.},

This paper aims to investigate the role of usability in contributing to a good UX in the rapidly-growing domain of e-commerce websites, where user experience is of paramount importance. We investigate this relationship by usability testing of participants' interactions with four telecommunication websites and by a questionnaire survey on the user experience of the sites, conducted with the same participants. The complex, context-specific, subtle and subjective nature of UX makes it difficult to measure and design for UX. The contribution of the study is to mention particular usability aspects that influence attributes of UX as an approach towards demystifying designing for UX. The paper should be of interest to designers, developers and researchers in the field of usability and UX.},

abstract = {Online meetings allow for remote conferencing and collaborative work among geographically dispersed participants and can save time and expenses that an ordinary face-to-face meeting would require. However, carrying real-time communication within the packet-switched Internet is a challenging task, especially in an African context, which is characterized by low bandwidth and unstable Internet connections. This paper presents and evaluates a tool that was designed to enhance the user experience for Web-based conferencing, given the constraints of Internet conditions typical of Africa. Approaches used to achieve this goal included: reprioritisation of multimedia streams, image differentiation, half duplex communication mode and stream compression. It was found that less than 56 kbps of bandwidth was required in order to: transmit audio; use video to convey presence; share slides and screen; and support text-based chat and floor control. Furthermore, users were largely satisfied with the tool and felt that it created a good user experience.},

Tools for making presentation with controlled interactivity include: Microsoft PowerPoint; Java Programming; HTML5; CSS4; Asymptote, Animated Gif; MathML and Beamer built with LATEX with TikZ/PGF for animations etc. The ease and richness in depicting sophisticated mathematical notations, symbols, scientific and engineering drawings with the latter make them the appropriate tool for creating scientific concept animations. This paper focuses on an approach for generating presentations. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and implementation of a new approach in capturing and embedding scientific concept animation in presentations. The basic idea is to translate sequence tagged diagrams in 2D and 3D produced with Inkscape into Beamer frames with sequence diagrams annotated with commands for animation. The output of Beamer frames is then compiled by LATEX to produce PDF files that can be used in a presentation. The applicability of this work is in the developing of contents for lessons in E-learning sites. The targeted domain for use is in developing science and engineering lecture presentations.},

abstract = {First appearing in the 1930s, skateboarding is an extreme sport in which a skater rides and performs tricks on a skateboard. Nokia Corp. aimed to augment the skateboarding experience with elements taken from modern video games, by coupling a movement measuring skateboard with a Nokia N8 smartphone. Their original implementation, while functional, had limited capabilities and suffered from a number of reliability issues. This project aimed to augment the skateboarding experience further by including location-awareness and skateboard trick visualisation capabilities into the application. A number of steps were also taken in order to improve the robustness of the skateboard hardware, these included modifications to the charging circuit, power source, and addressing the sensor board's vibration susceptibility. A user study was then performed in order to determine what effect the modifications had on the usefulness of the system, focusing on the system's potential as a skateboard trick learning tool. The study showed that, even though users found the visualisation interesting, the system offered limited value as a training device due to the current restrictions which exist in its visualisation capabilities.},

abstract = {The issue of driver distraction remains critical despite efforts that aim to reduce its effects. In-Car Communication Systems (ICCS) were introduced to address visual and manual distraction occurring when using a mobile phone whilst driving. ICCS running on mobile phone have increased the number of people using ICCS as they can be installed at no cost and the quality of speech recognition on mobile devices is improving. Little research, however, has been conducted to investigate usability problems with mobile ICCS. This paper proposes a new model to address some of the issues found with current mobile ICCS, called the multimodal interface for mobile info-communication with context (MIMIC). This paper discusses the design and usability evaluation of a prototype mobile ICCS, designed using MIMIC. Several tasks were evaluated using different metrics including time on task, task completion, task success, number of errors, flexibility, user satisfaction and workload. Results obtained show that the users gave a good overall rating to the mobile ICCS, which indicates that users will easily accept such technology. Future work will include redesigning the speech user interface in order to address the usability issues found with the current prototype.},

abstract = {Tablet computers and e-book readers are growing in popularity, with proponents of the technology citing the device's size, ease of updating content, clarity of the screen (particularly with electronic ink), and ability to store and carry multiple books in a lightweight form. Within the context of education, these devices have begun to be prescribed by schools and universities to replace paper based textbooks. Although tablet computers and e-book readers offer significant advantages over paper-based textbooks, the current cost of the device makes them inaccessible for many users. Digital photo frames on the other hand provide similar functionality to e-book readers, for a fraction of the cost. This paper presents an empirical investigation into the use of digital photo frames as low cost ebook readers in three disadvantaged schools in South Africa. It investigates their use across primary school and high schools, highlighting teachers and learners' enthusiasm about the ability for all learners to be able to see class material without having to print it out. Questionnaires, observations, focus-groups and interviews were all used to solicit participants' perceptions and use of the technology. The data collected was thematically and categorically analysed. Most of the drawbacks emanated from hardware issues experienced by one class in a particular model of digital photo frame. This investigation concluded that digital photo frames could be successfully integrated into the classroom if teachers are provided with adequate training.},

abstract = {The current focus on the development of mobile and ubiquitous computing technologies presents new and exciting challenges for the evaluation of interactive products. Despite a vast and growing literature on mobile phone requirements for the elderly there are no customisable design guidelines to support and inform designers and especially, the people who buy and sell mobile phones for the elderly.This paper presents a method for using a customisable, prioritised checklist to guide phone and feature selection, specifically for older adults. To identify and isolate the items for this list, we collected data relating to the needs of elderly mobile phone users by interviewing 147 elderly mobile phone users. The data was analysed and the findings used to construct the checklist. Building on and extending previous research involving guidelines and checklists, this paper adds value by proposing a prioritized checklist to inform the selection and design of mobile phones. The mechanism prioritises features, attaching a weight to each, to support quantification of the suitability of a particular phone for a specific person. The same mechanism can be used by interface designers who have to select an optimal set of features. The paper should be of interest to mobile phone users, designers, practitioners and researchers in the field of mobile Human-Computer interaction.},

Interest in the subject remains the most important factor. Major changes were identified regarding how important self-efficacy is considered to be and the importance of career progress. Another important finding is that male computing major students appear to be totally re-evaluating their beliefs regarding what is important in choosing a career.

abstract = {People are entirely dependent on the environment for existence. In spite of this crucial dependency, human activities are degrading the Earth's environment. The degradation now threatens the wellbeing of all people and possibly the long-term survival of the human race. Environmental degradation has many dire symptoms, such as anthropogenic climate change including global warming, deforestation, water and air pollution, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, and depleted fish stocks, all of which are intensified by an increasing global human population. Environmental sustainability is the solution to environmental degradation, and emphasises maintenance of the environment in order to support human life into the far future. There are several degrees of environmental sustainability, namely very weak, weak, strong, and very strong or absurdly strong. Of these, the overwhelming scientific consensus on environmental degradation necessitates strong environmental sustainability.Organisations are prevailing and prominent social structures that drive the world's economy. Nevertheless, organisations continue to degrade the environmental during the extraction of natural resources, production and processing, and the emission of wastes. However, organisations have considerable resources for achieving environmental sustainability, in the form of technology, global reach, knowledge, power, innovative capacity, motivation, and the capacity for change.Organisational change is impacted by Information systems (IS), which have been influential in enabling and transforming the world's organisations over the past fifty years. IS include information technology (IT) hardware and software, people, processes, and have specific purposes. Green IS includes Green IT, which focuses primarily on environmental sustainability throughout the IT lifecycle, and Green IS aim to enable and transform entire organisations toward environmental sustainability. Green IS present a fundamental solution to organisational environmental degradation, and researchers have developed numerous Green IS frameworks in this regard, each with a particular and significant perspective. This paper responds to the urgency of achieving strong environmental sustainability by synthesising the existing Green IS frameworks into a single Green IS framework that is purposefully aligned to strong environmental sustainability. This paper is theoretical and exploratory in nature, and makes an original contribution by providing a synthesised Green IS framework aligned to the concept of strong environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {Information Technology (IT) adoption challenges facing organizations are too complex to be resolved using only one methodology. Most existing Information Technology (IT) adoption models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) only consider individual behaviour and views on technology adoption, without providing mechanisms to accommodate multiple stakeholder perspectives in an organization. In this paper we propose an IT adoption framework, expected to assist an organization in resolving problem situations from multiple perspectives. Our framework provides mechanisms for addressing conflict of interest among stakeholders, which is rather common with IT adoption in organizations.},

abstract = {In developing countries such as South Africa, many companies are reliant on information and communication technology (ICT) to provide accurate, relevant and timely information. ICT systems are constantly implemented, upgraded, modified or replaced to obtain and sustain a competitive advantage. These initiatives are often managed as projects. While financial resources and effort being spent on ICT are increasing, these projects are not always perceived as successful. It is therefore important to understand the factors that influence the outcome of South African ICT projects relative to their original constraints. The goal of this article is to determine the factors that influence South African ICT projects, taking into consideration the fact that most current published research on this topic was done within the context of developed countries such as the USA and Europe. This is done through a longitudinal study that originated in 2003. The outcomes of ICT projects in South Africa as well as the factors that influence them were determined through extensive surveys in 2003, 2008 and 2011. An analysis was done of the factors together with a correlation between the main factors contributing to project outcomes. The purpose was to establish whether a factor's presence or absence influenced the eventual outcome. The factors that contribute to a successful outcome are soft issues such as communication and requirements engineering rather than the more technical aspects associated with the implementation of a project. The benefits of this article are that it firstly provides a South African perspective of current ICT project management practices, and secondly, it highlights factors that influence project outcome over a period of a decade. Companies can use this information to improve their current practices. An important aspect is that the longitudinal analysis indicates the same factors and companies can improve project success if they focus on these factors. The value of the research results presented in this article lies in the realisation that project success is not just determined by adherence to best practices or formal processes, but requires an environment and context conducive to business success.},

abstract = {The debate ensues as to whether the traditional focus of computing research on theory development and verification and therefore has adequate immediate practical relevance. Despite increasing claims of the potential of design science research (DSR) to enhance the utility of the IT artifact and consequently practical relevance of research, many computing researchers seem to be reticent to accept this paradigm as a legitimate form of scholarly research. DSR is a relatively new paradigm in computing and little is known about its uptake in South Africa. In this paper, we investigate the opinions about DSR among South African computing scholars. Findings from a survey of 53 respondents indicate low adoption rates. The paper also investigates some of the key barriers preventing the uptake of DSR. The paper concludes with some implications as well as suggestions for building a local DSR community.},

abstract = {Packet captures are used to support a variety of tasks, including network administration, fault diagnosis and security and network related research. Despite their usefulness, processing packet capture files is a slow and tedious process that impedes the analysis of large, long-term captures. This paper discusses the primary components and observed performance of CaptureFoundry, a stand-alone capture analysis support tool designed to quickly map, filter and extract packets from large capture files using a combination of indexing techniques and GPU accelerated packet classification. All results are persistent, and may be used to rapidly extract small pre-filtered captures on demand that may be analysed quickly in existing capture analysis applications. Performance results show that CaptureFoundry is capable of generating multiple indexes and classification results for large captures at hundreds of megabytes per second, with minimal CPU and memory overhead and only minor additional storage space requirements.},

abstract = {Existing Web interoperability protocols are, arguably, overly complex as a result of each protocol being designed by a different group, providing a single service, and having its own syntax and vocabulary. Some standards, such as RSS, are popular and are designed with simplicity in mind and include easy to understand documentation, which is a key reason for its high adoption levels. However, the majority of protocols are complex, making them relatively difficult for programmers to understand and implement and thus hampering communication between heterogeneous information systems. This paper proposes a possible new direction for high-level interoperability protocols by focusing on simplicity. The High-level Interoperability Protocol - Common Framework (HIP-CF) was designed and evaluated as a proof of concept that, if interoperability is simplified and it is made easier for programmers to understand and implement protocols, it could lead to having more interoperable systems as well as increased protocol adoption levels. Evaluation showed that this is a reasonable view and that there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to interoperability protocols.},

abstract = {Currently there is no consensus on what exactly software architecture is or where the boundary between software architecture design and application design lies. In this paper the concept of a software architecture is analyzed from a number of different perspectives. In particular, it is argued that a software reference architecture is a relatively pure specification of a software architecture as it addresses only infrastructural and quality concerns and does not provide any application functionality. Two examples of widely adopted reference architectures are analyzed in order to gain a deeper understanding of the concept of a software architecture. Current definitions of software architecture are analyzed and three classes of software architecture definitions are identified. The differences of the concept of software architecture across these classes is discussed and their relationships to current architecture description languages are explored. It is argued that none these definitions provide a sound basis for differentiating between application and architecture components. Based on insights obtained from the analyzed reference architectures, the paper proposes a new definition of software architecture as well as a specification of the elements of a software architecture specification. Software architecture is defined as the software infrastructure within which application components providing user functionality can be specified, deployed and executed. It is argued that a software architecture description should include, across levels of granularity, the basic concepts and constraints within which application components are to be specified, the architectural components addressing technical concerns, the integration infrastructure, and the architectural strategies used to concretely address quality requirements.},

abstract = {In South Africa, there is a lack of structure or guidance for schools on how to deal with cyber threats. There are no clear procedures that are consistently followed by schools, governing boards and educators, and the cyber threat process is not widely known and understood by educators, learners and their parents/guardians. As a result, many learners remain vulnerable to the negative effects of cyber threats. An example is a Krugersdorp High School girl who was attacked after a cyber-threat ordeal, (The Star 9 February 2012: 1). In this paper a framework is therefore proposed that schools can implement to assist learners with cyber threat incidents.The methodology that will be followed in this article is, firstly, to determine from the literature how a victim of cyber threat can be helped, secondly, to develop an incident handling structure that will assist learners in reporting cyber threats, and thirdly, to develop a framework which will address the lack of structure, guidance or procedures when dealing with cyber threats in schools.The gap which exists now deters learners from reporting cyber threat incidents. To fill this gap, the authors propose an incident handling structure which will assist learners to report and receive protection against online threats. It is hoped that, in the end, learners will know what to do when they are threatened online. In addition, cyber threat policies and procedures are proposed to protect and inform learners and their parents about cyber threats. These procedures collate, outline legislation and the policies of the Department of Basic Education. The aim is to give schools rights and responsibilities in addressing cyber threat incidents.Practical considerations such as time and costs limit the study to a sample of schools in South Africa. The framework for intervention in cyber threat incidents as part of school policies in South Africa is merely a proposal to the rightful stake holders, since policies for schools are determined by the Department of Basic Education which the authors are not members of.},

abstract = {Capacity in and enhancement of critical, scarce and intermediate skills are seen as a national priority in South Africa. The Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) in South Africa has prioritized the success of the Further Education and Training (FET) sector to meet this need for capacity development in critical, scarce and intermediate skills. Management information systems (MIS) are pivotal in the efficient and effective running of FET colleges. Therefore, the evaluation of MIS success is an essential spoke in the wheel of FET college success. The problem is that no MIS success evaluation model for FET colleges could be found. In this paper, we describe the development and testing of an evaluation model and tool for MIS success. Information system's evaluation theory and an analysis of FET policy documents were used to propose an initial success evaluation model and tool (questionnaire) for an educational environment (FET colleges) in South Africa. Using a quantitative approach the tool was applied in a survey at one public FET college to evaluate the success of the MIS deployed at the college. Findings from the survey lead to the refinement of the model which is also articulated in this paper and reflected as the SAFETMIS model. The paper is novel in proposing an IS theory based model and tool which can be used to evaluate MIS success at FET colleges and similar education contexts. The paper should be of interest to researchers in the field of Information Systems success evaluation and also to practitioners and managers in the field of Education.},
