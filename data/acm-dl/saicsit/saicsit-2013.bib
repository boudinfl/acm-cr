abstract = {Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) systems have produced a new convention in writing where vowels are often omitted, where new suffixes have appeared, where numerals and symbols often appear in the place of letters which have a similar shape or sound, and where words are often spelled phonetically. A word such as mister may be spelled numerous ways including mista and mistr (with new suffixes). When both participants to a MIM conversation understand these new spelling conventions, there is no problem. But in a situation such as automated topic spotting, it is advantageous to attempt to associate these new spellings (mista and mistr) back to the original word (mister). This paper describes work in creating a spelling corrector for MIM conversations for use after stop words have been removed from a conversation, after words have been stemmed, and after double letters have been collapsed to single letters. Four different similarity calculations Jaccard, S\o{}rensen-Dice, Cosine, and Overlap are investigated and tested with historical data from the Dr Math mobile tutoring environment. This research found that the Overlap similarity calculation was the least accurate of the four measured. In situations where the length of the various words were the same, S\o{}rensen-Dice and Cosine similarity calculations were identical. Jaccard and S\o{}rensen-Dice worked equally well, however, they required different numerical cut-off values for misspelled words.},

abstract = {In this paper cycle picking in defined as an optimisation problem where cycles are chosen from a directed graph under the constraint that any node that is in a cycle in the original directed graph must be in at least one of the chosen cycles. This problem is an abstraction of a real-world problem where people who require different sized shoes cooperate to be able to buy shoes that fit. The paper considers a number of variations of the problem -- the minimum number of cycles, the all small cycles and the minimum total cycle length views. The paper also shows how the directed graph can be amended to ensure that every node in the original graph is in at least one cycle of an augmented graph before the optimisation phase commences. This is the equivalent of adding dummy people to the group of all people who need shoes to ensure that everyone who needs shoes has a group (even if it contains dummy nodes) of other people with whom to cooperate. Finally a simple greedy heuristic approach for finding approximate solutions to instances of the problem is considered.},

abstract = {General-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU) has great potential to accelerate many scientific models and algorithms. However, some problems are considerably more difficult to accelerate than others, and it may be difficult for those new to GPGPU to ascertain the difficulty of accelerating a particular problem. Additionally, problems of different levels of difficulty require varying complexities of optimisations to achieve satisfactory results, and currently there is no clear separation between the different levels of known optimisations, which would be helpful to new users of GPGPU. Through what was learned in the acceleration of three problems, problem attributes have been identified to assist in evaluating the difficulty of accelerating a problem on a GPU. We envisage that with further development, these attributes could form the foundation of a difficulty classification system that could be used to determine whether GPU acceleration is practical for a candidate GPU acceleration problem, aid in identifying appropriate techniques and optimisations, and outline the required GPGPU knowledge.},

The paper concludes with a consideration of mechanisms to expand the flexibility and power of the GPF algorithm to construct a fully programmable GPU packet classification virtual machine, which can perform massively parallel classification, data-mining and data-transformation to explore and analyse packet traces. This virtual machine is a component of a larger framework of capture analysis tools which together provide capture indexing, manipulation, filtering and visualisation functions.},

Access to this rich data could be enhanced by transcriptions of the text; however, the complex diacritics used in the notebooks complicate the process of transcription. Machine learning techniques could be used to perform this transcription, but it is not known which techniques would produce the best results. This paper thus reports on a comparison of 3 popular techniques applied to this problem: artificial neural networks (ANN); hidden Markov models (HMM); and support vector machines (SVM). It was found that an SVM-based classifier using histograms of oriented gradients as features resulted in the best word recognition accuracy of 58.4%. Furthermore, it was found that most feature extraction parameters did not have a large effect on recognition accuracy and that the SVM-based recognisers outperform both ANN- and HMM-based recognisers.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how the driving context (driving events and distraction level) can be determined using a mobile phone equipped with several sensors. The majority of existing in-car communication systems (ICCS) available today are built-in and do not use the driving context. This creates two issues: firstly, the use of an ICCS is limited to specific cars and secondly, the driver's safety remains an issue, as the driving context is not taken into account. This paper discusses two experiments in which data are collected, trained and tested in order to create a model that predicts driving events and distraction level. A mobile, context-aware application was built using the MIMIC (Multimodal Interface for Mobile Info-communication with Context) Framework. The Inference Engine uses information from several sources, namely mobile sensors, GPS and weather information, to infer both the driving event and the distraction level. The results obtained showed that the driving events and the distraction level can be accurately predicted. The driving events were predicted using the IB1 technique with an accuracy of 92.25%. In the second experiment, the distraction level was predicted with 95.16% accuracy, using the KStar (decision tree) technique. An analysis of the decision tree showed that some variables were more important than others in predicting the driving context. These variables included the speed and direction, as well as acceleration, magnetic field and orientation.},

abstract = {Classroom Response Systems, colloquially known as Clickers after the predominant hand-held input device, are widely used because they allow students to respond in class to questions posed by the lecturer. This improves active learning and interaction in large classes---students are more involved, and lecturers can assess understanding and even take remedial action. Unfortunately, Clicker systems are relatively expensive, particularly in a developing-world context. They typically cost $200--700 for a base station and $30--50 per Clicker.In this paper we present an inexpensive alternative to Clickers. Poll sheets with coloured blocks printed on a white background are held up by the students and a camera-phone is used in panoramic mode to photograph the class. This image is then processed using computer vision to count and classify the students' responses.While the 85% recognition rate we achieve is certainly not as accurate as Clickers, this approach nevertheless has many of the same benefits for active learning at a fraction of the cost: $0.20 per poll sheet, assuming a laptop and camera-phone are already available.},

abstract = {The 8-puzzle problem is a classic artificial intelligence problem which has been well-researched. The research in this domain has focused on evaluating traditional search methods such as the breadth-first search and the A* algorithm and deriving and testing various heuristics for use with informed searches to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The study presented in this paper evaluates a machine learning technique, namely genetic programming, as means of solving the 8-puzzle problem. The genetic programming algorithm uses the grow method to create an initial population which is iteratively refined using tournament selection to choose parents which the reproduction, mutation and crossover operators are applied to, thereby producing successive generations. The edit operator has been used to exert parsimony pressure in order to reduce the size of solution trees and hence the number of moves to solve a problem instance. The genetic programming system was successfully applied to 20 problem instances of differing difficulty, producing solutions to all 20 problems. Furthermore, for a majority of the problems the solutions produced solve the problem instance using the known minimum number of moves.},

abstract = {Information sharing on the Internet has become a streamlined process through services such as e-mail, blogs and recently also Online Social Networks (OSNs). The speed of posting information in one central place and the convenience of this information reaching a vast audience at the same time is a great advantage of this style of communication, but at the same time also a danger. The aim of this article is thus to introduce a prototype software model that can analyse not only the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that users share on OSNs, but with whom they share this. Such analysis will give users a good indication of how their private information is shared based on different settings within their OSN profiles. To successfully develop such a model, familiarity with the concepts of information sharing and PII is firstly investigated. Identifying information leakage within one of the most popular OSNs follows. In combination with our programming knowledge, a prototype model is introduced and an overview of preliminary results is given. Due to the generic nature of the model, we are able to visually introduce and explain the process of information deduction -- an aspect of information sharing often overlooked due to its invisible nature. After analysing the information gathered from our model, we conclude that the immense popularity of Facebook on both a global and local scale contribute to its success, but at the same time make its users more prone to leak information and subsequently be the potential targets of cyber criminals. The ease, anonymity and borderless nature of the Internet in combination with the poor default security settings of our investigated OSN all contribute to the lucrative industry of cyber crime. Proper user awareness is crucial to preventing the leaking of any information in an online environment, but for many users this still equates to (a) PII in the sky.},

abstract = {USB Mass Storage (UMS) devices are affordable, convenient, practical, and have the ability to interface easily with a number of operating systems, and various hardware systems. UMS devices are found among virtually any person in the workplace today. However, UMS devices hold significant security risks, often overlooked. These risks arise mainly due to their compact size, storage capacity or the fact that UMS technology is integrated into Smartphones, cameras, music players, to name most significant. Considering that UMS technology is incorporated into devices that employees need daily to perform their work, such as Smartphones, it is not a feasible option to ban UMS technology from the workplace. However, without a guiding framework, UMS devices pose security risks to both organization and individual users.This paper reports on research conducted at the research institution in South Africa to evaluate the employee's understanding of the security risks to the organization and to them in person. From the results derived from the research conducted, a framework was developed to address the security concerns associated with UMS devices.},

The results indicated that exposure to traditional input methods is not a factor in the effectiveness of the BCI. Thus a person can effectively use the BCI without prior knowledge of computers which broadens the acceptability of the interface.

abstract = {The implementation of Microsoft (MS) technologies/solutions as organisational infrastructure has become popular in the South African and international higher education (HE) arena. With benefits such as reduced costs, improved productivity and improved service delivery, MS technologies/solutions seem to be the preferred choice for many institutions worldwide. This study presents work in progress on identifying the quality of service using this new organisational infrastructure within the Durban University of Technology (DUT). DUT is the first University of Technology (UoT) in South Africa to implement nine MS technologies simultaneously. Through this implementation, the DUT has attempted to greatly simplify the collaboration and communication of its employees and ensure the security and protection of the organization's information and assets. Since migration to the MS platform, staff have raised concerns regarding the new solutions, pertaining to aspects such as security (with specific reference to login credentials and data), accessibility (with specific reference to mobile devices and wireless connectivity) and reluctance to use self- help tools to improve their IT experience. Migrating from a non-integrated system to an integrated one has also resulted in IT service delivery becoming a contentious issue regarding the support received from the UoT's IT staff. This paper discusses the types of MS technologies implemented at the university and the impact that these solutions have had on the full time administrative and academic staff at the university regarding their perceptions and expectations of current IT service delivery. The quality of this service was measured using the SERVQUAL instrument. As a result of the research, a service management framework appropriate for the predominantly MS (Microsoft) environment will be proposed to the DUT's Information Technology Support Services (ITSS) management.},

This implies that academic publications should be findable via standard search engines. The purpose of this research was to determine the best type of query to lead to a high-ranking website containing the required abstract when searching for academic publications.A questionnaire was used to gather data on published research outputs. A variety of search queries were constructed for each output, and these queries were run to find research output abstracts online.An analysis of the results provided a variety of patterns when searching for known published academic content. The patterns were different for journal articles, conference papers, books and theses.Some of the abstracts were ranked highly on Google search result pages, with others not ranked among the first ten results. Overall the best results were provided by combining the author surname with the first sentence of the abstract text.It was concluded that the generation of search queries be alternated between the two most successful query types, rather than focussing on one type only.},

abstract = {Smart use of business intelligence (BI) can allow organizations to leverage the huge amounts of transactional data at their disposal and turn it into a powerful decision support mechanism that gives them competitive advantage. Despite the potential benefits of an effective BI system, the adoption and use of BI systems within the enterprise remains low, especially among smaller companies with resource constraints. This can partly be explained by the predominant deployment approach available today in which a firm needs to procure, install, configure and operate a BI system in-house. Barriers of high cost, complexity and lack of in-house expertise discourage many firms from adopting BI systems. This paper argues that adopting a cloud computing model, where BI is offered as a service over the Internet can lower these barriers and accelerate the pace of BI adoption. However, migrating BI systems from traditional on-premise environments to the cloud presents huge challenges. There are technical, economic, organizational and regulatory hurdles to overcome. Further, BI systems are multi-component (ETL, Data warehouse, data marts, OLAP, reporting, data mining etc.) and deciding which component(s) to move to the cloud, and which ones to leave on-premise needs careful consideration. In addition, the fact that cloud computing is still in its infancy means there is a general lack of conceptual and architectural frameworks to guide companies considering migrating enterprise systems to the cloud. This paper takes a closer look into traditional BI and proposes a conceptual framework that companies can use to chart an adoption path for cloud BI. The framework combines attributes of IT outsourcing, traditional BI, cloud computing as well as decision theory to present a consolidated view of cloud BI. The domain of South African Higher Education was chosen as the target in which the framework will be tested.},

abstract = {Over the past ten years mobile phone technology have been adopted and become integrated into the daily lives of the larger South African population especially students at higher educational institutions (HEIs). Given the realities of South Africa, as a developing country where public information access can be unreliable or even non-existing in some areas, mobile phone access has become the preferred communication channel and most students have become mobile-centric. In contrast, the public provision of administrative and academic information by universities is mostly pc-centric. Against the background of the global drive towards equal access to learning opportunities, institutions in developing countries are challenged to provide access through technologies that are accessible, usable, scalable and sustainable. Therefore, there is a need at institutional level to develop strategies for providing mobile cellular technology access to services, content and interaction. Hence, the aim of this paper is to investigate the critical categories and their characteristics for providing content and services for facilitating students' private access and interaction through mobile cellular phone technology at HEIs. Literature analysis was used as the research strategy to propose a conceptual framework for categorising the provision of mobile centric information access and interaction at HEIs. The framework could be a useful tool for informing HEIs' ICT strategy when rolling out mobile phone information access and structuring policies.},

abstract = {Expatriate adjustment research has identified a number of challenges that expatriates experience when adjusting to the host country such as spousal influence, cultural training/understanding, fluency in the host language and personality or emotional readiness of the expatriate need to be accounted for. These challenges are amplified when it is considered in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which has large cultural distance when compared to an average Western culture and therefore provides a setting for an interesting study. This ongoing study has thus far proposed a theoretical model derived by following Glaser's Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM). This paper will report on a specific aspect of this proposed model namely the substantive category "degree of flow" which extends the previous discussion of "degree of isolation". This paper describes how the Flow Theory was operationalized at affective level to aid the understanding of the emotional relationship expatriates in KSA have with the Internet. An expatriate flow model was developed based on the generally accepted three stages of Flow Theory namely: Antecedents to Flow, Experience of Flow and Consequences of Flow.},

abstract = {Crowd computing is a term that has been used only recently in the literature, and has been conceptualised in various ways as being related to crowdsourcing, human computation, social computing, cloud computing and mobile computing. This literature lacks a common definition of crowd computing, and emerging technologies with somewhat similar uses have added to the conceptual confusion. Whilst some authors have referenced work by other scholars and a few have attempted to provide a definition of crowd computing, it appears that the multiple streams of research and definitions have evolved somewhat independently, perhaps due to the relative newness of this area of research.This paper reconciles and integrates the various descriptions of crowd computing within the extant literature, in order to propose a definition of crowd computing which can be used to position the research already conducted on this subject, and can be used as a starting point for further research.Crowd computing has been described in various ways including distribution of human intelligence tasks to mobile devices, cloud computing with humans, human problem solving with large numbers of people using computers, and broadly as a set of human interaction tools for idea exchange and non-hierarchical decision making. From the literature four common characteristics can be identified to define the boundaries of the term, i.e.: participation by a crowd of humans, interaction with computing technology, activity that is predetermined by the initiator or application itself and the execution of tasks by the crowd utilising innate human capabilities.},

abstract = {The social sustainability of ICT for development projects such as e-government in developing nations remains a challenging issue. Particularly pertinent to the concept of e-government is that of electronic participation (e-participation) of citizens in services offered over an e-government platform, yet studies claim that such initiatives exacerbate social exclusion problem. Globally, and specifically in Africa, the ineffective participation of citizens is marked by waning confidence in service delivery capabilities of political institutions, yet e-government is considered as one of the reform instruments for the attainment of good governance. Governments and pressure groups in many countries are realizing that these trends are problematic, and are seeking to broaden and deepen citizen participation in governance, notably through the use of mobile technologies that continues to play a vital role in the trajectory of ICT development in Africa. This study advances the prominent role that mobile technology will play in anchoring e-participation strategies and policies to improve the social sustainability of ICT4D projects geared towards improving governance. The paper presents the results of cluster analysis of a South African survey aimed at assessing the accessibility, attitudes and the skills necessary for embedding mobile technology as part of an e-participation strategy. The results indicate that, despite the predominant perception that socially excluded groups typically lack the skills, equitable access and the right attitudes for e-inclusion mobile technology provides a viable platform for enhancing e-participation. The results also highlighted skepticism related to the potential of mobile technology in augmenting government services. Our analysis revealed that the skepticism is partly linked to aspects of electronic illiteracy. We therefore recommend that for e-government to achieve long term sustainability there should be a focus on electronic literacy in the formal educational sphere and also in work practices.},

abstract = {Following the Object Management Group's (OMG) Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach, the semi-formal, service-orientated "Use Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design" (URDAD) method is used by requirements engineers to specify a software system's functional properties in a Platform Independent Model (PIM). PIMs are represented using the URDAD Domain Specific Language (DSL), and thus conform to the URDAD MOF meta model. As a result, they can be transformed into Platform-Specific Models (PSM) for frameworks such as Java Platform Enterprise Edition (JEE) Enterprise Java Beans (EJB). This paper describes the semi-automatic transformation of a URDAD PIM into a EJB PSM, which is the basis for the further generation of EJB program code. For this purpose, a new prototype CASE tool was implemented to facilitate such transformations. The tool was evaluated using a non-trivial example project, with results indicating that it produces the PSM and template code that constitutes the static Java EE EJB structural representation of the example PIM.},

abstract = {The design of Digital Library Systems (DLSes) has evolved over time, both in sophistication and complexity, to complement the complex nature and sheer size of digital content being curated. However, there is also a growing demand from content curators, with relatively small-size collections, for simpler and more manageable tools and services for managing content. The reasons for this particular need are driven by the assumption that simplicity and manageability might ultimately translate to lower costs of maintenance of such systems. This paper builds on previous work in order to assess the flexible nature of the proposed design approach ---the explicit adoption of a minimalistic approach to the overall design of DLSes. A two-axis evaluation strategy was used to assess this proposed solution: a developer-oriented survey assessed the flexibility and simplicity; and a series of performance benchmarks were conducted to assess the scalability. In general, the study outlined some possible implications of simplifying DLS design; specifically the results from the developer-oriented user study indicate that simplicity in the design of the DLS repository sub-layer does not severely impact the interaction between the service sub-layer and the repository sub-layer. Furthermore, the scalability experiments indicate that desirable performance results for small- and medium-sized collections are attainable.},

The resultant architectural description includes the identification of architectural components addressing non-functional concerns, the abstractions into architectural patterns introducing infrastructural constraints, the tactics through which quality attributes are realized, and the description of concepts and constraints which the architecture introduces for application components.When applying the method to a large industrial case study, it is found that the method does assist in exposing important architectural decisions, but that it is labour-intensive and that it is difficult to assess the completeness of the architectural description produced by using this method.},

abstract = {The South African Sign Language research group at the University of the Western Cape has created several systems to recognize Sign Language gestures using single parameters. Research has shown that five parameters are required to recognize any sign language gesture: hand shape, location, orientation and motion, as well as facial expressions. Using a single parameter can cause conflicts in recognition of signs that are similarly signed. This paper pioneers research at the group towards combining multiple parameters to better distinguish between similar signs. This eventually aims to enable the recognition of a large SASL vocabulary. The proposed methodology combines hand location and hand shape recognition into one combined recognition system. The recognition approach is applied to 12 SASL signs that consist of six pairs of signs with the same hand shape performed at two different locations. It is shown that the approach is able to achieve a high average recognition accuracy of 79% across all signs and distinguish between the signs effectively. It is also shown to be robust to variations in test subjects.},

The proposed method achieved a high average recognition accuracy of 85% for frontal facial images. It also achieved a high average recognition accuracy of 80% for faces rotated at 60°. It was also shown that the method is able to continue to recognize facial expressions even in the presence of full occlusions of the eyes, mouth and left and right sides of the face. An additional finding was that both the left and the right sides of the face are required for recognition. This was due to the fact that subjects are seen to regularly perform facial expressions with more emphasis on either side, affecting the recognition accuracy.},

abstract = {The Upper Confidence for Trees (UCT) algorithm has been shown to perform well in complex games, but samples undesirable areas of the search space when building its game tree. This paper explores the design and parametric considerations for augmenting the UCT algorithm with an Artificial Neural Network (NN) to dynamically prune the game tree created, thus limiting the game tree created. The expansion phase of UCT is augmented with a trained NN to create a novel UCT-NN variant that includes prior knowledge and strategy. This paper considers the game of Go-Moku for investigating the design and parametric considerations of UCT-NN. The parameters considered are the exploration and exploitation balancing C parameter, the NN training and structural design parameters and the various pruning schemes which could be used in UCT-NN. Parameter tuning techniques are provided for managing the parametric concerns in the proposed algorithm. Results of parameter experiments indicate that a single value of C = 1.41 is suitable for the games studied. Suitable values were found for the structural and training parameters of NN, which were required to test various pruning schemes. Of the various pruning schemes considered, an exponentially decaying scheme is found to be superior in the UCT-NN algorithm where a large amount of moves are initially pruned, but fewer moves on deeper ply.},

abstract = {The Living Labs in South Africa (LLiSA) projects have been introducing telecommunications and Internet technologies to remote rural South African municipalities for over seven years. The projects have exhibited mixed success with some quite successful in assisting schools and health clinics to use the Internet for obtaining and sharing information and others enjoying initial success only to fall into disuse. Knowledge management for technology expertise, Internet and computer usage, and software tools has required a transfer of knowledge to local interested individuals. However, knowledge management is typically not an explicitly named aspect of the projects. Rather, projects cite a need for training and development of skills for maintainability but no explicit knowledge management. This report describes knowledge management characteristics then analyzes information and computer technology for development (ICT4D) projects to develop best practices in knowledge management. The LLiSA projects then are evaluated with attention to the extent and methods used for knowledge management. Knowledge and skills have been spread across several people in each location with encouragement for them to further train others as their backups, thus, maintaining a constant, growing stream of individuals who can provide local support for the technology's use. The knowledge management used is ad hoc, simple, and somewhat effective in developing a growing base of technology users in the project's supported locations. Recommendations for formal knowledge management in ICT4D and, specifically the LLiSA projects, are developed.},

abstract = {Research shows that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to economic growth and social development of communities. However, in rural areas there are challenges that appear to slow down the progress and the realisation of the impact of ICTs. These ICT challenges include poor infrastructure, technological illiteracy, high costs of ICTs etc. An assessment of ICT challenges within rural areas was done. A composite methodological approach was employed in this study. This involved the use of qualitative research techniques such as participant observation, workshops, focus groups and individual interviews supported by document analysis. The Siyakhula Living Lab (SLL) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa was used as the case study. The paper aims to identify an association between the ICT challenges based on rural ICT users and ICT experts. Two study groups were selected i.e. rural users within SLL, ICT experts in Europe and Africa, government officials and academic institutions were engaged to understand the current ICT challenges in rural areas. Each of the study groups had 50 participants. Chi-square tests were used to test the level of association between each of the challenges.Results show that there are variations in identifying current ICT challenges between SLL rural users and ICT experts. ICT experts mentioned poor ICT infrastructure as the main challenge while this was not what SLL rural users thought. Rather, the SLL community pointed technological illiteracy as the main challenge. The paper aims to show the degree on how each of the ICT challenge was viewed by each of the study groups.},

abstract = {Gamification is the application of game mechanics and player incentives to non-game environments. When designed correctly, gamification has been found to increase engagement and encourage targeted behaviours among users. This paper presents the gamification of a university course in Computer Games Development using an online learning management tool, including how this might generalize to other courses.Our goal with gamification was to improve lecture attendance, content understanding, problem solving skills and general engagement. The success of this intervention was measured using course marks, lecturer evaluations, lecture attendance, and a questionnaire; all with strongly positive results. However, this must be balanced against the costs, both monetary and time, required to successfully implement gamification.},

DBR is applied to develop and evaluate an m-learning environment, Mobile Learning Research (m-LR) delivered by mobile handheld devices. The emergence and evolution of DSR in the information systems discipline and, similarly, DBR in educational technology are overviewed, noting similarities and differences. The development of an m-learning application for a South African tertiary education context, illustrates DBR. The development and research process involved six iterations, comprising four evaluations and two digital profile studies. The study reflects on the nature and extent of the conformance of m-LR to the features and tenets of DBR. In line with the characteristic dual-outcomes of DBR, the development process not only generated the designed artifact, m-LR, but also produced theoretical contributions.},

Several issues that impacted on the ease of use and usefulness of the tool were identified. We concluded the research by stating that as early technology adopters, we may well have invited some of the issues reported.We subsequently changed the webinar software, and presented another series of webinars. This paper presents an update on our and our students' perceptions of the ease of use and usefulness of the webinar as a collaborative tool. Employing the useful lens of Activity Theory, we present a qualitative and quantitative overview of data obtained from various sources, including 92 students in a post-course survey. In particular, we report the results by considering the dynamics between the webinar tool, the subjects, the community, the object and goals of the series of webinars, the rules, and the divisions of labour employed. Tapping into thematic patterns and commonalities, we identify remaining tensions that may have accounted for individual variations. As such, this research builds on lessons learned, and offers a much needed foundation, some benchmarks and some pointers for future implementations of the webinar as a collaborative tool in an Open Distance Learning environment.},

To this end, we have designed and administered a test for computational thinking ability, and contrasted the results of this test with the class marks for the students involved. The results of this test give us an initial view of the abilities that students possess when entering the computer science course. The results indicate that students who performed well in the assessment have a favourable pass rate for their class tests, and specific areas of weakness have been identified. Finally, we describe the plan for a follow-up test to take place at the end of the course to determine how students' abilities have changed over a semester of studies.},

One such domain in which they have been a success is educational timetabling. However, all the research in this area has focused on university course and examination timetabling. This paper is amongst the first to examine the use of hyper-heuristics to solve the school timetabling problem. The paper compares the performance of a selection constructive hyper-heuristic, a generation constructive hyper-heuristic, a selection perturbative hyper-heuristic and a hybrid hyper-heuristic combining a generation constructive hyper-heuristic and a selection perturbative hyper-heuristic, in solving the school timetabling problem. Each of the hyper-heuristics employs an evolutionary algorithm to search the heuristic space. All four hyper-heuristics were applied to solving the five problems of differing difficulty in the Abramson benchmark set. The selection perturbative hyper-heuristic was found to produce the best results for the all the problems in the benchmark set.},

abstract = {There are many people who have different size feet and need different sizes of shoes to get shoes that fit well. A static approach to solving the problem could be to get a list of all the people who need shoes and their size requirements, then from that list find groups of people who can cooperate. In a graph theory sense this means creating a directed graph from the input data, finding all of the simple cycles in the graph and then picking the smallest set of cycles such that each node in a cycle in the original graph is in at least one cycle in the final set of cycles.This paper looks at a more dynamic approach of dealing with the problem. People who need shoes enter the system, by giving their shoe size requirements, and remain in the system until their needs have been satisfied. This approach is represented by an online algorithm which stores all the possible paths in the graph at any stage, checks for cycles when a new person enters the system and updates appropriately in each iteration. The online algorithm can also accommodate "altruism" (where an individual chooses to stay in the system to assist others to buy shoes) and spreading the cost of buying additional pairs of shoes (for example, two people buying three pairs of shoes) in order for individuals to more quickly have their shoe needs satisfied. The three versions of the online algorithm were implemented and tested on synthetic data. The online algorithm generally satisfies the needs of the people entering the system although its performance is sometimes affected by the lack of knowledge of the entire input set.},

The set of normals forms the metadata from which the algorithm determines if a region is an optimal region. Peak (maximum) and valley (minimum) regions are detected by determining the angle between the normal and a unit vector. A line intersecting algorithm is then used to determine if a region is either convex (i.e. a peak) or concave (i.e. a valley).},

abstract = {A wireless Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) provides the possibility of communicating anytime anywhere in a temporary arrangement in the absent of a pre-existing network infrastructure. However, this presents new security challenges in comparison to the conventional wired and wireless networks, as it is more vulnerable to malicious attacks due to its unique features. Nodes' cooperation in MANET is a necessity for the routing protocol in use to achieve the desired routing purpose, to allow for efficient exchange of information in such temporal network. The implementation of transmission power-aware algorithms in the classical MANET routing protocols such as ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), to preserve the nodes' limited battery power complicates the possibility of relying entirely on watchdog mechanisms to safeguard the network against black-hole attack. Furthermore, the watchdog's eavesdropping operation requires buffering of large amount of packets during the monitoring process. This paper proposes an algorithm which utilises cluster-heads and votes from neighbourhood nodes to detect and avoid malicious nodes. It addresses watchdog scheme's weakness in detecting black-hole attack in the presence of power-aware routing protocol, thereby increasing the overall network performance in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio.},

Whilst architectures have been developed to aid with the distribution of content within mobile software domains, this has not extended to inter-domain distribution. For instance MXit, Android and Facebook developers are required to develop separate applications when distributing content. Little research has been conducted to investigate mobile inter-domain content distribution. This paper proposes a new architecture Mobile Inter-Domain Development (MIDD) to address some of the issues with existing architectures and allow for inter-domain content distribution. This paper discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of the MIDD architecture as a proof of concept. The proof of concept architecture was evaluated and results showed that whilst memory consumption is of concern, networking and lines of code (LOC) efficiency improved through the use of MIDD. Future work will include increased component level mapping capabilities, lower level event handling and higher level user interface generation. Dynamic module loading and unloading will also be incorporated to lower the memory requirements.},

Determining accurate context information, in real-time, for implementing various adaptations in mobile web applications remains a challenge. Physically determined context information for use during adaptation has generally produced unsatisfactory results in mobile web applications. An alternative to acquiring context information is by the use of various software-based techniques that are referred to as logical context sensors. This paper discusses the implementation of an integrated logical context sensor that can determine context information in realtime for use in various mobile web adaptions.An international field study evaluation of the context sensor was conducted. Results indicate that the integrated logical context sensor successfully determined accurate context information in real-time.

abstract = {Business Intelligence (BI) applications provide business information and drive decision support. To derive maximum benefit from BI applications, the applications need to be used optimally. Optimal use depends on various factors including the usability of the product. The documented need for BI usability research together with the practical need for BI evaluation guidelines provides the rationale for this study. The purpose of the study was to investigate the usability evaluation of BI applications in the context of a coal mining organisation. In a mining environment companies need to derive maximum benefit from BI applications, therefore these applications need to be used optimally and that places the focus on usability. The research is guided by the question: What criteria should be used to evaluate the usability of BI applications. The research design included user observation, heuristic evaluation and a survey. Based on observations made during user support on a BI application used at a coal mining organisation a log of usability issues was compiled. The usability criteria extracted from this log was compared and contrasted with general usability criteria from literature to synthesize an initial set of BI usability evaluation criteria. These criteria were used as the basis for a heuristic evaluation of the BI application used at the coal mining organisation. The same BI application was also evaluated using the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) standardised questionnaire. The results from the two evaluations were triangulated to provide a validated and refined set of criteria. The main contribution of the study is the usability evaluation criteria for BI applications presented as guidelines. These guidelines deviate from existing evaluation guidelines in the emphasis on information architecture, data quality and learnability.},

abstract = {Modelling the business processes of an organisation offers benefits such as improved communication, increased understanding of processes, support for change management and gaining of competitive advantage over other organisations. However, Business Process Modelling (BPM) in large projects often needs to be carried out collaboratively in a team environment. The benefits of collaborative modelling are a reduced workload for modellers and improved quality, readability and accuracy of models. The result is also increased understanding of the processes amongst team members. Traditional technologies and BPM tools have several usability problems and often do not allow for effective collaboration and integration of business process models.Touchscreens are becoming the standardised modality of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs. This paper investigates the use of collaborative business process modelling (CBPM) software and hardware for improving the usability of CBPM projects. A field study comprised of two assignments was carried out to evaluate the difficulties of CBPM with traditional BPM tools running on desktop PCs. A BPM software prototype was then designed which allows the drawing of business process (BP) models using touch and also enables the synchronous display of the process model on multiple tablet PCs.},

A framework for sketch-based interaction is proposed, and a prototype system is evaluated on a number of different criteria. The main findings of the evaluation were that users found the sketch-based interaction intuitive, easy to learn and preferred it to standard interaction techniques. The main limiting factors of a sketch-based interaction technique were identified as adequately dealing with recognition errors and managing algorithm execution time so that the system remained interactive.

abstract = {In indexing of and pattern matching on DNA sequences, representing all factors of a sequence is important. One efficient, compact representation is the factor oracle (FO). At the same time, any classical deterministic finite automata (DFA) can be transformed to a so-called failure one (FDFA), which may use failure transitions to replace multiple symbol transitions, potentially yielding a more compact representation. We combine the two ideas and directly construct a failure factor oracle (FFO) from a given sequence, in contrast to ex post facto transformation to an FDFA. The algorithm is suitable for long sequences. We empirically compared the resulting FFOs and FOs on number of transitions for many DNA sequences of lengths 4--512, showing gains of up to 10% in total number of transitions, with failure transitions also taking up less space than symbol transitions. Preliminary results on sequence processing runtimes when using FFOs originally showed these to be multiples of those when using FOs, but partial memoization already leads to drastic improvements. Altogether the results are promising, particularly for the use of FFOs for (repeated) factor detection, where recognition speed may be less important than memory use.},

It resides as a second configuration-layer on top of any hardware FPGA layer. The V-FPGA architecture allows direct access to its virtual configuration bits, thereby allowing any combinational or sequential digital circuit to be realized.To demonstrate hardware evolution on a V-FPGA, a 2x2 multiplier circuit is evolved in this paper. The evolutionary code makes use of an adapted genetic algorithm which manipulates 20 logic elements (LEs). The resulting evolved multiplier circuit, when compared to a conventional multiplier, uses one less LE and improves two of the outputs' critical paths. Thus, it is experimentally shown that the V-FPGA is a viable hardware-platform on which hardware evolution can be implemented; and how hardware evolution is able to optimize conventional circuits.},
