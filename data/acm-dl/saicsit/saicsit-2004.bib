abstract = {With the advent of the Internet came the promise of global information access. In keeping with this promise, Digital Libraries (DLs) began to emerge across the world as a method of providing structured information to their users. These DLs are often created using proprietary monolithic software that is often difficult to customise and extend. The Open Digital Library (ODL) project was created to demonstrate that DLs can be built as a network of components instead of as monolithic systems. Although the ODL approach has largely been embraced by the DL community, it is not without a few shortcomings. This paper introduces a graphical user interface and its associated framework for creating DLs from distributed components, consequently addressing a number of the limitations of ODL, as well as presenting a novel and generic approach for creating component-based systems.},

The results of the heuristic evaluation indicated that a number of usability problems exist on the selected sites. The empirical evaluation results also identified a number of usability problems on the selected sites. A correlation analysis between the two sets of results was used to identify a number of e-commerce design guidelines that are of specific relevance to the South African e-commerce market. This paper proposes a trust model for e-commerce in South Africa, based on the guidelines that were identified as being significant for e-commerce in South Africa.},

abstract = {The adoption of ICTs in developing countries often comes with the argument of how the technology will assist in bridging the 'digital divide'. This paper argues that often ICTs fail to realise their potential, in many instances, due to the overly technical focus of the information systems design process. A case study from South Africa illustrates how the design of an information system, which takes the social situation into account, can address exclusion. Using an interpretive participatory action research approach a community-based information system was designed, in one municipality in South Africa, to address the vulnerability of children. The revised information system is primarily a paper and oral based system, but links with computerised systems at higher levels. Thus, though ICTs were not directly used in the design, due to the nature of the particular context, the connection with the higher levels of the health system have been made. The case study illustrates the importance of designing information systems which are culturally and technologically appropriate.},

The Internet has allowed applications to be extended to customers of an organization, where interaction can take place through a web site, typically from home or office. The focus of attention with such applications is customer satisfaction. In this research, a 21-item, 7-factor instrument developed to measure customer satisfaction with web sites that market generic digital products and services was modified slightly, and then empirically tested and validated in the context of Internet banking specifically. A 19-item, 5-factor validated instrument emerged, the factors being Customer Support, Security, Ease of Use, Transactions and Payment, and Information Content and Innovation. The difference in number of factors as compared to the generic instrument was attributed to the unique nature of Internet banking web sites. These and other findings are discussed in the paper, and their implications examined.},

address = {ZAF},
abstract = {Information systems and information communication technology (IS/ICT) have a profound impact on the modern business environment. The role of IS/ICT in organizations has changed significantly over the past forty years. Its initial data-processing support function has evolved into it functioning as a corporate resource of strategic importance and competitive advantage. This new role necessitates an update of IS/ICT management strategies. However, it is argued that the prevailing approach to the improvement of IS/ICT management processes is fragmented. A more comprehensive IS/ICT management capability maturity framework was therefore developed through this research project. A review of historic and recent research studies produced a list of 15 factors that are indicators of organizational IS/ICT management capability maturity. A process of elimination, combination and iterative modelling, supported by interviews with five senior IT professionals in large South African organizations, yielded the final seven indicators that comprise the model. These indicators are IS/ICT Applications, Business-IT relationship, IS/ICT strategy alignment, IS/ICT user profile, IS/ICT managerial paradigm, IS/ICT governance and IS/ICT organization. In the proposed framework these seven indicators are combined in 'spider diagram' notation, and an assessment of an organization's level of maturity on all seven indicators is combined in an IS/ICT management capability maturity profile or footprint. It is argued that this framework is a valuable tool for evaluating an organization's overall IS/ICT management capability, or for comparing different organizations, or even to benchmark with the appropriate maturity profile for a particular industry.},

Using the resolution-based theorem-proving program OTTER, we illustrate how these proof obligations may successfully be discharged using a set of well-chosen heuristics.},

WBL tools provide integrated environments of various technologies to support diverse educators' and learners' needs via the Internet. One of the biggest challenges facing WBL environments is the organization, communication and presentation of information in a logical and usable manner via the WWW. A good information architecture design can increase the usability of a website. Information architecture is concerned with the design of organization, labeling, navigation and searching systems to help users find and manage information. Several Higher Education (HE) institutions in South Africa have developed their own WBL tools some of these, however, exhibit usability problems with respect to information architecture (IA). The goal of this paper is to investigate and discuss the issues involved with the IA of WBL tools developed in South Africa.},

address = {ZAF},
abstract = {This paper introduces a Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) based on a hybrid of Crowds and anonymising proxies. The PET--referred to as Flocks --operates by establishing a number of Web proxies and letting these proxies randomly forward requests to other proxies (or the final destination). This distributes users' requests over a number of such proxies, thereby helping to protect their (browsing) privacy.The problem that the paper considers is the effect of two primary design parameters on the privacy of the overall system. These parameters are the probability with which a proxy sends a request to the destination server rather than another proxy (α) and the number of proxies in the system (<i>N</i>). Two privacy objectives are identified, namely the number of hops used to satisfy a request and the portion of proxies that 'know' about a request. A third requirement deals with the external communication costs of the system. A formal analysis is performed to determine these three factors from the two identified parameters. Finally numerical examples are used to explore the impact of these two parameter choices in concrete terms.The proposed PET differs from existing PETs in two significant manners: It is primarily intended to be used inside an organisation to protect the privacy of users inside the organisation (in particular, employees) and it takes explicit cognisance of forensic factors.},

title = {Hybrid Traffic Engineering: The Least Path Interference Algorithm},
year = {2004},
publisher = {South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists},
address = {ZAF},
abstract = {The traffic engineering mechanisms currently deployed in IP networks are based on routing metrics (cost metrics) which optimize system-wide measures of performance such as average response time, throughput, delay, etc., discounting the diversity of QoS requirements from the mixture of narrow- and broad-band applications carried by the new multi-service Internet. This paper presents a new approach for routing flows in IP networks. The approach referred to as the Least Path Interference (LPI) is based on a route optimization model which (1) moves the traffic away from path interfering links (the path interference quantifying the network reliability) to re-route fewer flows upon link failure and (2) maximizes the link congestion distance (quantifying the network optimality) to reject fewer flows under congestion. LPI implements a hybrid traffic engineering model combining offline estimation of the path interference and online path finding. LPI is based on a simple path selection model where no changes to the traditional routing algorithms are required besides designing a new mixed cost metric to combine reliability and optimality. The Least Path Interfering Algorithm (LPIA); a routing algorithm derived from LPI is applied to compute paths for the traffic offered to a 50-node network. Simulation reveals (1) performance improvements compared to Open Shortest Path (OSPF) and Constraint Shortest Path First (CSPF) routing in terms of routing optimality and network reliability and (2) the same performance as the recently proposed Least Interference Optimization Algorithm (LIOA) algorithm.},

Unlike much past research, significantly more interest came from those previously 'deprived' in the IT area. Those from schools previously disadvantaged by the apartheid school system and without access to computer or Internet access at home were more inclined to study CS or IS. These categories also expressed most optimism about IT job prospects and starting salaries, as did female scholars. Perceptions of the activities of IS students were far less accurate than of CS students. Males were more predisposed to study IS than females, and black students and those without school computer access favoured CS. Possible reasons for this are discussed.},

abstract = {The discipline of Information Systems is sometimes accused of being heavy on practical technology but light on conceptual theory. Identifying 'isomorphisms' between specialist research areas in other disciplines (especially mathematics) has produced spectacular results. This paper suggests that isomorphic thinking could also benefit IS research, in particular by leveraging existing frameworks and applying them outside their original context in isomorphic IS research areas.The paper briefly defines the concept of isomorphism and illustrates the principle of isomorphic mapping using some well-known IS frameworks and theories which originate from other disciplines. This is followed by a practical case study on how a suggested framework for evaluating models could be applied almost literally to seemingly unrelated research areas such as website analysis. This case study exposes the underlying similarities ('isomorphism') between these research fields. The article concludes with some additional suggestions on how isomorphic thinking could advance research in other IS areas.},

This is not intended to be in any way a definitive description of these research traditions. Rather it is hoped that the paper will stimulate a discussion about the use of three different paradigms, and in doing so respond to the call for IS researchers to be more aware of the research methodological options available to them.

It is recognised that achieving alignment contributes immensely to ensuring that investments in IT result in improvements in organisational performance. Alignment is a concern, not only for commercial organisations, but also for tertiary-level educational institutions, many who have invested heavily in IT for teaching and educational purposes, as well as to improve efficiency and effectiveness of administrative processes. It is therefore necessary for research on alignment to be conducted in such institutions, as much of the literature assumes a commercial organisational context. In this paper, a case study is reported in which it was found that integration between business and information systems (IS) planning, rational-adaptation in IS planning, IT managerial resources, and IT implementation success are all factors likely to influence alignment. Their relative importance, however, is very much dependent on the organisational context, the timing of the study, and on whose perspective is being sought.},

Patterns have been accepted as being useful in software development and more recently also in Human-Computer Interaction. A concerted effort is being made in Software Engineering to identify and document anti-patterns. Patterns and anti-patterns are essentially about transferring captured expert knowledge, therefore compatibility between the nature of anti-patterns and the nature of the learner's internal knowledge representation and processing is crucial. This paper addresses the differences and similarities between patterns and anti-patterns and how this impacts on the mental models and cognitive processing of patterns and anti-patterns. We present evidence from theories of mental modelling and reasoning that highlight possible significant dangers in the use of anti-patterns to teach novices human-computer interaction principles. If the notion that the current representation of anti-patterns is not supporting cognitive processing is correct, a new approach to structuring anti-patterns is needed. Recommendations are made towards a new specification technique for HCI antipatterns.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) is fast becoming the central location for goods, services and information. The very factors that make the Internet such a powerful medium, combine to make the Internet a treasure trove of personal information regarding individual Web users. Users' movements and information are logged as they navigate the Web, often without their knowledge and definitely without their explicit consent. This has lead to internet users voicing concerns over the loss and violation of privacy. Inspired by the Hippocratic Oath, Agrawal et al. [2002] introduced the concept of Hippocratic database systems. These systems are responsible for the privacy of data they manage, and must comply with ten defined principles. In a previous paper, the authors investigated the feasibility of applying the ten principles of Hippocratic databases to the management of log files. The focus of this paper is to expand on the originally proposed Hippocratic log file architecture by introducing a layered view of the architecture. In examining this layered view, the major processes that would be involved in the implementation of Hippocratic log files will be discussed.},

title = { 'Where Have All the Trainers Gone?' E-Learning Strategies and Tools in the Corporate Training Environment},
year = {2004},
publisher = {South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists},
address = {ZAF},
abstract = {Online learning (also known as e-learning) will ultimately become the new training paradigm, taking its place alongside traditional contact situation training and changing the face of training generally. A number of trends, which include technological developments and the growth of the Internet, have accelerated the move to e-learning in educational institutions and the corporate world. Technology and the Internet facilitate a more active role in the training process. There is a gap in the literature as to which online tools and learning strategies are suitable for human resources development in the corporate training environment. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss e-learning strategies and tools for human resources development in the corporate training environment in South Africa. The study may provide important insights into the future integration of online learning by South African companies, human resources development managers and policy formulators. This research was based on a qualitative research approach where individual interviews, focus group interviews, observation and document analysis were used to gather data. The participants in the research were corporate trainers, managers and trainees in 15 South African companies in which online learning is used as a training delivery mode. This study tried to involve companies in different industrial sectors. These included the energy, mining, insurance, banking, telecommunication, and services industrial sectors. In this study convenience sampling was used. The findings of this study appear to indicate that organisations in South Africa were competent in the integration of online learning for human resources development in the corporate training environment. This could be attributed to the fact managers and facilitators were using various strategies, techniques and online tools in their endeavours to integrate online learning in their training environment. The above-mentioned competence holds great promise for the future of the level of productivity in South African organisations.},

abstract = {As the transmission of data over the internet increases, the need to protect connected systems also increases. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are the latest technology used for this purpose. Although the field of IDSs is still developing, the systems that do exist are still not complete, in the sense that they are not able to detect all types of intrusions. Some attacks which are detected by various tools available today cannot be detected by other products, depending on the types and methods that they are built on. Using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of the methods that IDSs use to detect intrusions. They incorporate the concept of Darwin's theory and natural selection to detect intrusions. Not much research has been conducted in this area besides the Genetic Algorithm as an Alternative Tool for Security Audit Trails Analysis (GASSATA) tool; there are very few IDSs that are completely developed from using GAs. The focus of this paper is to introduce the application of GA, in order to improve the effectiveness of IDSs.},

abstract = {The <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> distance function is commonly used in the clustering of DNA sequences such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs), an important biological application. The use of <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> allows approximate string matching to be performed with a good balance between selectivity and sensitivity. The computational challenges of EST clustering make the efficient evaluation of the <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> function an imperative. The paper presents a new incremental algorithm which requires amortised cost of <i>O(m)</i> per evaluation on realistic data sets (where <i>m</i> is the average length of an EST). In addition, two filtering heuristics are presented which improve clustering performance by estimating upper bounds on the <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> scores.},

The centre of our system is a tool that can be used to customize Greenstone Digital Library collections for small displays. To lower the entry level, this tool has been designed to provide an abstraction from Greenstone's low level architecture and other computing technologies, such as HTML and Java Script. We also place a strong emphasis on evaluation and incorporate users throughout the software development cycle. Lastly in the discussion, we speculate that by designing usable and customizable systems, there is the potential of breaking down the open source revenue model, which relies on providing services for systems that are hard to use and configure.},

abstract = {The digital divide between rural and urban areas within developing countries is vast. We investigate how to address this divide by introducing Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) into remote rural areas. Our aim is to discover how to create locally relevant software applications with appropriate content for these areas. We use a user centred design approach and a modified software development lifecyle that is participatory, iterative and cyclical. This process is based on principles from Participatory Design and Action Research. This paper presents our initial experience of developing a telemedicine application for a rural village in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa using this process. We present an overview of the methodology, describe the software application we have developed and cite several challenges we have faced. Finally we conclude that an inter-organisational and inter-disciplinary approach is needed to develop software for remote areas.},

abstract = {Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers based on local search and backtracking search algorithms have been used to solve many computational search problems, with recent advances making them competitive with alternative specialist constraint satisfaction search techniques. However, the formulation of problems as satisfiability problems are often unnatural and cumbersome. Boolean SAT solvers are also unable to employ additional structure on the problem domain to speed up search. Recently, regular SAT was proposed as an extension of Boolean SAT, and shown to have significant computational advantages over Boolean SAT in some benchmark domains. In this paper, a further extension to regular SAT is proposed. Namely, variables are interpreted over intervals of truth values from a finite, totally-ordered domain. This gives a more compact problem representation, while still utilising the domain structure during search. The paper presents interval SAT as an extension to regular SAT, relates both regular SAT and interval SAT to Post logic and Post algebras, and gives a generalised Davis-Putnam search algorithm for interval SAT.},

It is also time consuming and labour intensive to design and implement efficient computer based tutorial systems that reduce the administrative burden of managing such tutorials. Building interactive computer based tutorials from components that come with already pervasively used and available COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf software) such as Microsoft Office promises to reduce both the development and maintenance effort. In this paper we begin by describing COTS systems and their development cycle. We then discuss a case study in which a COTS-based tutorial was used to manage a Microsoft Excel tutorial cycle in an Information Systems first year course. We found that the approach of using the familiar Microsoft Office environment for COTS-based tutorials was well received by students, saving them time. The computer assisted tutorial approach improved the feedback to students and lecturers but required considerable time from developers and the lecturer concerned. We discuss our observations and future work.},

Wireless middleware is a software component that facilitates the interaction of components in the wireless environment by considering these characteristics. Another popular technology used for distributed communication is XML. XML messaging and Web Services have been used for enterprise integration in the traditional computing environment but its verbose nature does not suite characteristics of the wireless environment. This paper introduces wireless middleware that uses XML messaging for communication and discusses the main disadvantage of XML messages, its verbose nature, which leads to a reduction in performance. Performance enhancement techniques are discussed. The design of two possible wireless middleware solutions is presented.

The method employed was to review relevant literature, compare the advantages and disadvantages of navigation architectures and to reach a conclusion. It was found that a number of options are offered to the designer of a website, including text-based links, navigation buttons, image maps, JavaScript, Flash elements, hidden menus and frames. All of these elements appeared to have a question mark over their positive contribution to the visibility of a webpage. The primary conclusion reached is that navigation architecture used on a website does impact its visibility to a search engine crawler. The webpage designer should exercise care in choosing a navigation scheme. One option is to duplicate navigation schemes to please both human and crawler visitors, which could add to clutter and information overload. Finally, some areas for further research are identified.},
