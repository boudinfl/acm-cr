abstract = {Instant messaging (IM) has gained huge popularity, not only in the social space, but in many sectors of work and everyday life. One such sector is finance, where IMs are used for bargaining, trading and many other financial information exchanges between parties. A popular IM software in finance is the Instant Bloomberg (IB). The conversations (chat histories) recorded via IB often contain crucial information about the financial positions of the market, quotes for different instruments, as well as unimportant texts. Automatic comprehension of this type of text is a natural language processing task. In this paper we employ front-end compiler analyses in the automatic comprehension and summarisation of financial chats retrieved from IB. Taking the result, we present a software tool called FINCHAN that takes lengthy chat histories and attempts to recognise the syntax up to a success rate of 98%, extracts semantic information to 61% success rate, generates concise summaries of these chats, and offers analyses of hidden patterns, text-to-speech synthesis of generated summaries, with functionalities for archiving/indexing IMs.},

abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have had a significant impact on business organisations to-date. As a result, numerous attempts to incorporate ERP experiences into university curricula have been made. Literature suggests many advantages and benefits of such integrated experiences, however quantitative evidence is not typically provided.This paper describes perceived competence gains through different modes of ERP education from an ERP curriculum collaboration project across Sub-Saharan Africa. A review of literature regarding ERP roles, competencies, education as well as the influence of cultural factors and learning environment on learning styles and outcomes is also summarised.Findings revealed moderate overall knowledge improvement (x = 3.3) using a 4-point scale (where 1 =not, 2 =a little bit, 3 = moderately and 4 =substantially). Business process knowledge and business related competencies for ERP consultants were most improved. ERP curricula is still deficient in developing interpersonal competence as this was rated the least improved competence. Achievement of competence varied significantly across academic disciplines as well as between countries. Student perceptions of their learning environment as influenced by cultural factors, were also found to have a significant impact on academic outcomes.},

abstract = {The growing ability to collect and integrate data from disparate sources on a larger scale creates new opportunities for improved decision making. The concepts of using data for predictions by using statistical or computational intelligence models have been researched extensively. However, the tools and techniques that make it possible to analyse the data in real-time as it is created brings about additional opportunities for discovering useful patterns and timely actionable insights. The prices of agricultural grain commodities are known to be volatile due to several factors that influence the prices of grain commodities. Moreover, different combinations of these factors are responsible for the price volatility at different times.This paper carries out a real-time prediction of the futures contract prices of white maize in South Africa as a case study for the use of neural networks for predictive analytics in the financial markets. The predictive analytics model implemented in this study takes into consideration the volatility of the market and the need for the model to be contextual. Relevant data from disparate sources were identified, acquired and integrated into a single source. Thereafter, an exploratory analysis was carried out to understand the relationships that exist between the acquired datasets. A predictive model for the December futures contract prices of white maize on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) was proposed using the Back Propagation Neural Network and SAP HANA was used as the enabling technology. The proposed model was used to predict the futures contract prices of white maize on the JSE over a period of time. The validation and evaluation of the proposed model indicate that this approach can be used to predict the futures prices of white maize in South Africa and can be incorporated into a Decision Support System for relevant stakeholders.},

abstract = {Access to healthcare is regarded as a basic and essential human right. It is generally acknowledged that Information and Communication Technology solutions have potential to improve access to healthcare, reduce healthcare cost, reduce medical errors, and bridge the digital divide between rural and urban healthcare centres. The access to personal healthcare records is however, an astounding challenge for both patients and healthcare professionals alike, particularly within resource-restricted environments, such as rural communities. Most rural healthcare institutions have limited or non-existent access to electronic patient healthcare records. This paper explored the accessibility of personal healthcare records by patients and healthcare professionals within a rural community hospital in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. A case study was conducted, where semi-structured interviews, observations, and interactive co-design sessions and focus groups were employed as the primary data collection methods in this study. The data was qualitatively interpreted using thematic analysis approach. A number of recommendations for improved access to personal healthcare records are discussed.},

abstract = {The digital market, including electronic books, has grown substantially over the past few years. The abundance of information may be particularly useful within academic fields. However, certain disciplines, such as computer science, may require additional considerations regarding formatting for electronic text books. This study investigated the influence of syntax highlighting on reading source code snippets, as it pertains to the two distinctive phases present when reading code. Participants were presented with a code snippet in either black-and-white or using standard syntax highlighting. Fixation timelines indicated that the distinctive phases exhibited when programmers read an unfamiliar code snippet, were present regardless of the presentation of the code. Furthermore, neither the fixation durations nor the number of fixations were significantly influenced by the presence (or absence) of syntax highlighting. Additionally, paired tests indicated that the reading behaviour of participants did not differ between the scanning and the reading phase, signifying that the cognitive load is not significantly different between phases. It can therefore be concluded that the lack of syntax highlighting does not adversely affect the reading behaviour present in the phases of code reading.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the emerging paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on the important role that people will play in the future connected world of digitized services and electronic "Things". The associated research highlights how IoT is influencing changes and requirements in communication required to facilitate decision making between systems, devices and people in a connected world. The paper provides background context on the development of IoT technologies and how these developments overlap with industry, enabling revolutionary changes such as Industry 4.0 and the advent of the Industrial Internet. The emergence of IoT technologies, IoT enabled industry and IoT influenced social change are discussed, highlighting the new requirements and production demands that are emerging for integrated communications, features and systems.The paper introduces a new end-to-end and framework for enterprise planning, adoption and deployment of a feature rich and integrated Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) system within a multinational enterprise. The new framework presents a multi-domain structure with four primary modular containers. This structured model introduces new concepts of a Core Governance Domain (CGD), Operational Management Domain (OMD), Unified Services Domain (USD) and Integrated Feature Domain (IFD). Combined these domains represent a coherent framework that supports initial deployment and planning, ongoing sustain and technical agile technical architecture. This research has been carried out within the scope of a multi-year automotive focused study in General Motors.},

Guidelines take the form of strengths and weaknesses as observed in the applied feature processing modules during preliminary experiments. The guidelines are used to implement an effective biometric fusion system at the feature-level to reduce the equal error rate on the SDUMLA and IITD datasets, using a novel feature-fusion methodology.},

abstract = {The argument of SQL vs NoSQL always requires the answer "It depends." If the participants in the argument about which database is better or more appropriate in a given situation have no background in any NoSQL database, then it is difficult to make informed decisions. In general, NoSQL databases arrange themselves into four groups: key-value stores, columnar databases, graph databases, and document databases. This paper describes a project to use gamification to encourage members of a busy corporate IT department to learn about the four groups of NoSQLs and give them brief hands-on experiences with one of each of the four categories: Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j, and MongoDB. The encouragement was done by using a combination of physical and virtual treasure hunts. Eight fun treasure hunts were created (two for each group of NoSQL) where participants in the office either worked individually or teamed up with other participants to find data hidden in each of the different types of NoSQL database. This data would then lead to a physical treasure box full of chocolates which was hidden in the office common area.},

However, limited research has investigated machine learning techniques for HGR in virtual reality applications (VR). This paper reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a static HGR system for VR applications using the LMC. The gesture recognition system incorporated a lightweight feature vector of five normalized tip-to-palm distances and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifier. The system was evaluated in terms of response time, accuracy and usability using a case-study VR stellar data visualization application created in the Unreal Engine 4. An average gesture classification time of 0.057ms with an accuracy of 82.5% was achieved on four distinct gestures, which is comparable with previous results from Sign Language recognition systems. This shows the potential of HGR machine learning techniques applied to VR, which were previously applied to non-VR scenarios such as Sign Language recognition.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how the interaction between organisational conditions, media capabilities and socially defined norms of email use can lead to negative consequences of use.A mixed-methods online questionnaire addressed the perceptions of police officers regarding the influence of email on police work and working relationships. Findings reveal that norms of email use, facilitated by the capabilities of this medium, exacerbate existing issues within the organisation such as conflict between management and operational level officers, and the view that bureaucracy related to increasing levels of accountability leads to feelings of overload and stress, and prevents officers from carrying out 'real police work'.The paper reflects on the maintenance of social norms, even in conditions where the behaviour may not be considered appropriate by all members of the group, with implications for further research in this area. The paper argues that norms of email use are perceived as inappropriate by the officers, but that these officers are constrained by and maintain these norms despite this. Results show the importance of considering the interaction between media capabilities, organisational conditions and social norms of use in understanding the consequences of email use within organisational contexts.},

abstract = {Open badges, as the new currency of learning, has the potential to motivate learners to participate in granular, evidence-based and portable learning interventions in organisations in support of lifelong learning. However, there is surprisingly little adoption of this new digital recognition scheme in South African corporate training and educational institutions. This paper examines the obstacles that may prevent organisations from using open badges in support of accreditation frameworks like the National Qualifications Framework for micro-credentialing. It also investigates the factors that contribute to the lack of enthusiasm for the Open Badges Framework in South Africa. Data was collected from key role players in the South African learning &amp; development fraternity as well as some international practitioners and learners. Activity theory elements were used to analyse the responses and potential contradictions were identified. It was found that all respondents are in favour of a learning landscape where non-traditional credentials become more valuable and that open badges are appropriate for any learning taking place anywhere and anytime. The main obstacles identified include the lack of understanding the benefits to the South African population at large as well as applicability in organisations and the resulting lack of best practices, lack of resources and resistance to change and the anticipated struggle to obtain management buy-in. However, none of the identified obstacles should be insurmountable and with focused effort and leadership it can be and should be addressed since there is consensus that the education and training industry can greatly benefit from such an implementation.},

abstract = {Privacy entails controlling the use and access to place, location and personal information. In South Africa, the first privacy legislation in the form of the Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act was signed into law on 26 November 2013. The POPI Act promotes the protection of personal information by South African public and private institutions and specifies the minimum requirements in twelve chapters, which includes eight conditions for lawful processing of personal information. In 2012, CIBECS as part of their State of Business Data Protection in South Africa survey assessed, amongst other aspects, how prepared South African institutions were to comply with the then forthcoming protection of personal information legislation. Since that survey, the POPI Bill progressed to an Act and, more recently, in 2015 processes commenced to appoint the Information Regulator (in terms of the legislation), who would be responsible for enforcing the POPI Act. Due to the aforementioned developments and looming enforcement date associated with the POPI Act, this paper assesses the level of understanding of the POPI Act by participants from South African institutions as well as the current level of compliance to the POPI Act. Specifically, the current level of compliance to Condition Seven of the POPI Act, relating to the confidentiality and integrity of electronic personal information, is explored. Furthermore, a view is provided of the financial value associated with electronic personal information maintained as well as the potential impact a data breach of electronic personal information may have on an institution.},

abstract = {In Open Distance Learning (ODL) institutions the teaching model is moving towards fully integrated information and communication technology applications. To successfully teach or facilitate the use of technology, academics need to have a strong comfort level with the use of technology tools. The academic staff are qualified and experienced subject matter experts but this does not translate to having the necessary technical competencies to do online teaching. They consequently could experience feelings of incompetency to facilitate courseware on a technology platform.The objective of this paper is to identify the factors that influence the user experience when using a Learning management system (LMS) in an academic institution. The research design comprises a convergent, parallel design mixed-method case study. A literature review was conducted to abstract the factors that influence the user experience into a conceptual framework. An expert review was conducted to evaluate the conceptual framework and then a questionnaire-driven survey was performed. The quantitative responses were analysed and the results revealed that eight of the nine factors proposed in the conceptual framework do have an influence on the perceived user experience of the academic when using the LMS. The scope of this paper is the analysis and presentation of the quantitative results of the study.The contribution of this paper is to present a framework of the factors that influence the user experience of the academic when using a LMS and to improve our understanding of the experience of the academic and the practical challenges involved for academics that have to facilitate learning in an online environment. The findings should be of interest to developers of LMSs and to institutions in support and training of academics that have to use the LMS.},

abstract = {Prediction of the lowest energy conformation of a protein chain is a challenging optimization problem in computational chemistry and biology. Simple lattice-based protein models have been shown to be effective representations of the characteristics of proteins important in protein folding. An effective genetic algorithm for conformational optimization of proteins represented by the hydrophobic-hydrophillic lattice model was recently published. In this work, we create a publically available implementation of this genetic optimization algorithm. Tests of our implementation show equivalent performance to that reported for the original, in terms of both optimal conformation and number of function evaluations. In addition, we test our implementation across a range of data set sizes to characterize the performance of the algorithm as chain length increases: benchmarking that is necessary for future optimization and parallelization of the algorithm.},

abstract = {A large number of Deaf people are unable to communicate by means of spoken language. Thus, a translation system that converts South African Sign Language to English and vice versa would be invaluable to the Deaf community. In order to recognise sign language gestures, five fundamental gesture parameters, namely, hand shape, hand orientation, hand motion, hand location and facial expressions, need to be recognised separately. The research in this paper aims to utilise deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, to recognise a set of hand shapes in various orientations within a live video stream captured on an iPhone mobile device. The research forms part of a larger project that aims to automatically translate South African Sign Language into English and vice versa. The research proposed two approaches for classifying gestures, a two stage approach and single classifier approach. The former approach managed to achieve an average accuracy of 70% and the latter an average accuracy of 67%.},

The deployment of these mobile enterprise applications in organizations have been shown to provide benefits however, history also shows that benefits from IT innovations are often over-promised and under-delivered. Managing these benefits becomes essential in order to realize the return on the investment required to build and implement mobile applications. This paper uses literature to inform the design of a benefit management process in an insurance company and also to identify the potential benefits and barriers from the use of mobile enterprise applications in a short-term insurance context.

abstract = {Blind people face difficulties when navigating unfamiliar environments. The information displayed on indoor signs and notice boards is of no use to them. In order to assist them with this challenge, we propose a real time system that can recognise a selection of indoor navigational signs placed over clear backgrounds. The selection of signs will consist of common samples from several different types of indoor signs. Given a captured image, the approach is to use image processing techniques to find the region of interest(ROI) that contains the sign and then extract this region for classification. Using sliding windows for searching the ROI can be time consuming and can lead to many false classifications, hence we used a more explicit approach that is faster and more reliable. We first segment the signs by colour, and then by shape recognition. The sign-type classification is done using a tree search structure that enables the use of iterative contour descriptors like the speeded-up-robust-features(SURF). Once a sign has been detected, this information is communicated to the user via stereo headsets. To evaluate the system's performance, several random pictures with and without signs were used to determine the system's detection rate. The user-feedback performance was evaluated by testing the system's usability score with volunteers.},

abstract = {Existing information sharing methods used by mobile devices require the user to repeat a series of steps to share one or more selected files with another individual. Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) focus on the reuse of existing knowledge to provide a more intuitive solution to existing user interfaces. The aim of this paper is to discuss the design of a NUI application, called MotionShare, to provide a solution to support information sharing among co-located mobile devices. MotionShare does not rely on any additional technologies to assist in positioning of the devices, unlike other existing systems. An example is the use of an external camera to determine the position of devices in an environment.MotionShare requires an initial calibration setup to calculate the approximate position and orientation of all the mobile devices in the environment. The approximate position was determined using Bluetooth, which was identified by conducting several experiments. The embedded sensors on mobile devices were used to determine the orientation of these devices. Focus groups were conducted to identify the most appropriate NUI gestures to utilise the position and orientation information. The results of these focus groups and systems selected from literature were compared. Based on this comparison, the most relevant NUI interaction techniques were then implemented to support information sharing among these devices. An analytical evaluation investigated the accuracy of device positioning and gesture recognition, where the results were positive. The empirical evaluation investigated any usability issues. The results of the empirical evaluation showed high levels of user satisfaction and that participants preferred touch gestures to point gestures.},

abstract = {The growing prevalence of continuous media use among university students in lecture environments has potential for detrimental effects. In this study the focus is placed upon the implications of digital media multitasking in a university lecture context for academic performance and learning. Previous studies reveal that students frequently engage with digital media whilst in a university lecture. Moreover, research has shown that multitasking imposes a cognitive cost, detrimental to learning and task execution. We propose, accordingly, that the constant distractions created by digital media interrupt the thought and communication processes of students and, subsequently, obstruct their ability to learn. To test this proposition we conduct a survey-based empirical investigation of digital media use and academic performance among undergraduate university students. A clear negative correlation was shown between frequency of media use and academic performance. This result confirms the hypothesis that there exists a negative correlation between digital media use during lectures and academic performance. The confirmation of this negative relationship suggests that media use poses a significant distraction to students.},

GSM is one of the approaches to business artifacts in which the business process is described around the lifecycle of the data. Since its introduction in 2011, several research teams have worked on formally proving GSM properties.This paper describes a transformation of deterministic finite state machines (DFSM) into GSM types, by mapping states to GSM stages and input symbols to GSM incoming events. The state transition function of the DFSM is mapped such that it forces each snapshot of the resulting GSM type to correspond to a state of the resulting machine. The transformation presented in here faithfully rewrites a DFSM into a GSM type and it is suitable for automation.},

While ICT has demonstrated a potential of curbing corruption, the factors influencing its efficiency have not been validated empirically. This study investigates the factors influencing ICT efficiency in curbing corruption in 52 African countries over a period from 2005 to 2014. Using Data Envelopment Analysis and Regression Analysis, technical efficiency scores were used as a dependent variable of corruption. Unlike other traditional regressions, the present study adopted a bootstrap method which corrects the inherent dependence among Decision Making Units' efficiency scores. The results indicate that gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and education are significant factors influencing ICT efficiency in curbing corruption while press freedom is not a significant factor. The findings suggest that using ICT to fight corruption in Africa should be implemented parallel with strategies that improve GDP and education if ICT has to successfully reduce corruption.},

abstract = {The adoption of project management as a discipline in both public and private sector organisations is still growing. The growth has been evidenced by organisations continually aligning project activities with business strategy to achieve their strategic goals and create value for their organisations. Some of these initiatives are managed as IT projects. In 2016 the global information technology (IT) spend is forecast to total US$3.54 trillion. Despite this growth in IT investment, IT projects still fail at an alarming rate. These failed IT projects have resulted in organisations not achieving their strategic objectives and goals, in addition to costing them huge amounts of money. Many factors contribute to IT projects failing, such as a poorly defined project scope, insufficient human resources, cost overruns, poor communication among project stakeholders, project auditing practices not being followed, inadequate practices in project risk management and lack of correct auditing of processes in IT projects. The majority of project audits are based on ad hoc management requests rather than systematic auditing processes throughout the project life cycle. Project managers are still challenged on managing IT projects to successful delivery. The problem addressed in this article is the lack of IT project auditing processes throughout the project life cycle to ensure IT project success. A conceptual framework is proposed for IT project auditing assurance throughout the project life cycle. The framework introduces high-level and detailed IT project assurance processes in each assurance review gate. These processes can be tailored to ensure the successful delivery of an IT project. The benefits of this article are its contribution to the body of knowledge with regard to project auditing. Secondly, practitioners and project managers can use this framework to audit IT projects to ensure successful completion of IT projects.},

The absence of a universal definition cause organisations to struggle to decide on what constitute CRM. While we acknowledge the diversity in the term CRM, we diverge from the view that it is exclusively relevant for driving sales and retaining profitable customers in for profit organisations. In this study we diverge from that view and present a CRM narrative within the context of a not for profit public institution. Using a practitioner-based inquiry, we explored the various CRM initiatives which a Higher Education (HE) institution implemented to achieve effective Information Technology (IT) service delivery. We describe these different CRM initiatives and their implications to effective IT service delivery. Our findings contradict the norm that CRM is for profitability purposes. The study revealed that CRM is a significant part of effective IT service delivery in not for profit public institutions and in situations where clients are internal. In addition to that, our study present alternative CRM initiatives with potential positive outcomes which other not for profit public institutions can implement to resolve CRM difficulties and to improve IT service delivery.},

The implementation of AR on mobile devices is known as Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR). MAR is in its infancy and MAR development software is in the process of maturing. Dating back to the origin of Computer Science as an independent field, software development tools have been an integral part of the process of software creation. MAR, being a relatively new technology, is still lacking such related software development tools.With the rapid progression of mobile devices, the development of MAR applications fusing advanced Computer Vision techniques with mobile device sensors has become increasingly feasible. However, testing and debugging of MAR applications present a new challenge in that they require the developer be at the location that is being augmented at some point during the development process.In this research study, a MAR recorder application was developed as well as emulation class libraries for Android devices that allows the recording and off-site playback of video, location and motion sensor data. The research objective was to provide a software emulator which provides debugging, testing and prototyping capabilities for a MAR application including the ability to emulate the combination of computer vision with locational and motion sensors using previously recorded data. The emulator was evaluated using different mobile technologies. The results indicate that this research could assist developers of MAR applications to implement applications more rapidly, without being at the location.},

abstract = {The symmetric travelling salesman problem is a real world combinatorial optimization problem and a well researched domain. When solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem a low-level construction heuristic is usually used to create an initial solution, rather than randomly creating a solution, which is further optimized using techniques such as tabu search, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, amongst others. These heuristics are usually manually derived by humans and this is a time consuming process requiring many man hours. The research presented in this paper forms part of a larger initiative aimed at automating the process of deriving construction heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems.The study investigates genetic programming to induce low-level construction heuristics for the symmetric travelling salesman problem. While this has been examined for other combinatorial optimization problems, to the authors' knowledge this is the first attempt at evolving low-level construction heuristics for the travelling salesman problem. In this study a generational genetic programming algorithm randomly creates an initial population of low-level construction heuristics which is iteratively refined over a set number of generations by the processes of fitness evaluation, selection of parents and application of genetic operators.The approach is tested on 23 problem instances, of varying problem characteristics, from the TSPLIB and VLSI benchmark sets. The evolved heuristics were found to perform better than the human derived heuristic, namely, the nearest neighbourhood heuristic, generally used to create initial solutions for the travelling salesman problem.},

abstract = {3D user interfaces allow users to view and interact with objects in a 3D scene and form a key component in many modelling applications used in engineering, medicine and design. Most mouse-based interfaces follow the same multi-view layout (three orthogonal, one perspective). This interface is difficult to understand, as it requires users to integrate all four views and build a 3D mental model. An alternative, Interactive Shadows, has been previously proposed that could improve on the multi-view's shortcomings but has never been formally tested.This paper presents the first quantitative user evaluation (n = 36) of both the multi-view and interactive shadows interfaces to compare their relative effectiveness and usability. Participants completed three types of tasks designed to be representative of object manipulation in current 3D modelling software.Interactive shadows were significantly better (p &lt; 0,05) for tasks requiring participants to estimate distance. This suggests interactive shadows interface might better help users approximate relative object positioning.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) research has become prominent in both academia and industry. With this, an interest in AI's ability to make sound decisions when compared to human decision making has grown. Predicting the outcome of sporting events has traditionally been seen as a difficult task, due to the complex relationships between variables of interest. Attempts to make accurate predictions are fraught with biases owing to the bounded rationality within which human decision making functions. This study puts forward the position that an AI approach using machine learning will yield a comparable level of accuracy. A random forest classification algorithm was employed to predict match outcomes in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The performance of this model was compared to aggregate results from Super-Bru and OddsPortal. The machine learning based system achieved an accuracy of 89.58% with 95%-CI (77.83, 95.47) vs. 85.42% with 95%-CI (72.83, 92.75) for the platforms. These results indicate that for rugby, over the limited period of a specific tournament, the evidence was not strong enough to suggest that a human agent is superior in terms of accuracy when predicting match outcomes compared to a machine learning approach, at a significance level α = 0.05. However, the model was better able to estimate probabilities as measured by monetary winnings from betting rounds compared to the two platforms.},

abstract = {Wicked problems are immensely complex problems that do not lend themselves to resolution through traditional problem-solving approaches. This capriciousness is particularly troublesome for organizations that encounter such problems due to their very nature being highly prone to fluctuation. Further, any attempts to resolve wicked problems tend to be irreversible --- for better or for worse. Decision support systems (DSSs) have long been hailed as a panacea of sorts for highly complex problems due to their ability to assist in storing, retrieving, and manipulating information to arrive at a decision. However, traditional DSSs, being originally aimed at semi-structured problems, are rendered almost ineffectual in the face of the high levels of complexity inherent in wicked problems. Consequently, this paper outlines the argument that posits procedural rationality as an alternative underlying mechanism for developing DSSs for wicked problems. An empirical literature review is utilized to locate the required characteristics of such a DSS, to evaluate cognizance thereof in the research, and to present an integrated model for the design, development, and utilisation of procedural DSSs specifically for resolution of wicked problems.},

abstract = {Food is not a finite resource, nor is the land it is cultivated on. Future generations will have to find creative ways to integrate production, marketing, distribution and technology in such a way that optimal usage of scarce food resources is achieved. Efficient fresh produce markets and specifically efficient electronic food spot markets of the future could play a central role in stimulating, coordinating and optimizing the flow of food across multiple geographical regions towards a growing urbanised population. But traditional approaches to the integration of technology might need to change. Information technology systems will need to play a much more prominent role than just facilitating sales transactions. In order to establish electronic fresh produce spot markets of the future, we require a deeper understanding of how broader institutional trust signals are to be facilitated through technology interfaces. This article explores the relationship between the use of self-service technology and the institutional environment emphasising the importance of understanding the relationship between technology's use and the specific institutional forces governing trust forming behaviour.},

The first set highlighted business process management, interpersonal, and holistic thinking competencies while from a tasks perspective process measuring, customer experience, staffing, and process improvement were highly ranked. Nonetheless process orientation was found to be more aspirational than applied which was ascribed in part to a lack of business process education.},

abstract = {This paper describes research relating to collaborative work by an ad hoc virtual team of students at a distance education university in South Africa. Feedback obtained after the task was completed indicates that the adoption of swift trust by at least one team member is required to move the collaboration process forward. The pattern of communication flow of the virtual team is important as it reflects the trust relationships; this was seen to be star shaped with the self-appointed leader, the most trusting team member, in the centre. The swift trust shown by the leader is rapidly followed by knowledge-based trust developed by each team member towards the leader but not towards all other members. It seems possible that low levels of initial trust lead to Perceived Ease of Use being given precedence over Perceived Usefulness when choosing the collaboration technology and this results in sub-optimal task-technology fit. Ad hoc virtual teams should be assisted by implementing strategies for leadership, building trust and for handling time constraints.},

abstract = {Introductory programming modules frequently have a low pass rate. This paper reports on an attempt to address this issue by introducing an interactive program visualization tutorial in the course material for an introductory programming module at the University of South-Africa (Unisa). The tutorial aimed to assist first-year programming students in an open, distance and e-learning (ODeL) environment in learning how to trace programs. To investigate the impact thereof students completed a questionnaire on their use of the tutorial, which were analysed in combination with their final marks for the module. This was repeated over two semesters.The findings indicated that the tutorial did not have the desired effect in the ODeL environment. Students' educational background had a far larger impact on their final marks than their tutorial use, emphasising the real need to take educational background into account when developing course material, particularly in ODeL.},

Drug screening facilities aim to identify new high quality drug compounds, or novel drug combinations, for treatment of tuberculosis. The experimental drug assay procedure produces multivariate data that is difficult to analyse and onerous to process in order to determine which drug combinations should be pursued for further development.In this design study, we have developed a visualization tool to assist with analysis and processing of this multidimensional data. The tool was developed with an iterative user-centred design process, beginning with a low fidelity paper mock-up through to the deployment of a fully functional, computer-based prototype that expert users judge to be both usable and effective.},

abstract = {Unit testing of software components requires that a component is tested in isolation. However, many components require the services of other components to provide their functionality. In order to decouple the component being tested from its dependencies, one commonly uses mock objects. Mocking frameworks which are currently used in industry use dynamic mock object generation with the mocking behaviour specified where the mocking is required, e.g. within unit tests. There is no guarantee that the mocking behaviour is consistent with the behaviour required from the component being mocked. Furthermore, these mock objects are not reused across unit tests and other areas where mocking is required.We consider an alternative approach to mocking where the mock object is specified against the contract being mocked and reused across unit tests and other code where mocking is required. These mock objects are tested against the component contracts for the components they are mocking. Furthermore, using dependency injection one is able to reuse the functional tests across unit tests (injecting mock objects for the dependencies) and integration tests (injecting actual components for the dependencies). Even though this approach does require more code to be developed for specifying mocking behaviour, this is offset by the mock object being reused across unit tests for components with the same dependency as well as across integration tests.},

abstract = {Developments in internet technology and pervasive computing have resulted in a variety of web-based applications (WBAs), including business transactions, information-delivery and social networking, as well as e-government, e-health and e-learning. Different websites have varying requirements and users have differing backgrounds, experiences and cultures. Users require effective, easy and enjoyable interaction, which is key to successful use and acceptance of applications. This study generated a model that can give rise to customized frameworks to evaluate three related, yet distinct, constructs: e-service quality, usability and user experience (e-SQUUX) of WBAs in an integrated manner.Following a rigorous review of 264 credible literature sources, a set of unique dimensions was identified, each associated with one or more e-SQUUX constructs. Through an iterative reduction and evolution process, an integrated conceptual e-SQUUX model was derived, comprising 24 categories, 75 main dimensions and 163 associated dimensions. The model is 'open' in that practitioners and researchers can make their own personal 'choice' from the components of the model to synthesize an implementation of the model to be used as an evaluation framework.},

The data gathered through an electronic survey, was analyzed by applying a number of statistical techniques, including regression and correlation analysis, to determine how consumers perceived different trust antecedents.Results from the study led to the conclusion that consumers will opt to purchase online, because it provides the extrinsic motivators of convenience and variety, as long as the protection of personal data can be guaranteed. The presence of the following antecedents, which provide the intrinsic motivation to transact online, is required on e-vendor websites for consumers to trust online purchasing: presence of third party seals; high quality product information; familiar processes; e-vendor reputation; product guarantees; public consumer feedback portals; and effective and accurate product delivery.},

These overlapping issues highlight a disconnect in the perspectives held between health scientists' focus on the application of behaviour change theories and components of interventions, and the information systems designers' focus on the application of persuasive design principles as software design features intended to motivate, facilitate and support individuals through the behaviour change process. A review of the current status and some examples of these different perspectives is presented, leading to the identification of the main issues associated with this disconnection. The main behaviour change technique issues identified are concerned with: the fragmented integration of techniques, hindrances in successful use, diversity of user needs and preferences, and the informational flow and presentation. The main persuasive design issues identified are associated with: the fragmented application of persuasive design principles, hindrances in successful usage, diversity of user needs and preferences, informational flow and presentation, the lack of pragmatic guidance for application designers, and the maintenance of immersive user interactions and engagements. Given the common overlap across four of the identified issues, it is concluded that a methodological approach for integrating these two perspectives, and their associated issues, into a consolidated framework is necessary to address the apparent disconnect between these two independently-established, yet complementary fields.},

abstract = {Designing a usable mobile phone interface is a non-trivial task, especially when it is intended for use by a special needs group. The group we focus on here is composed of the elderly in developing countries. To inform specialised design, researchers produce and refine sets of tailored guidelines. In this case there is surprisingly little empirical evidence attesting to the value or efficacy of such guidelines. Corroborating evidence, in the form of endorsements of designs that have resulted from their implementation, would constitute such evidence. The aim of this paper is to evaluate existing mobile interface design guidelines for the elderly in developing countries by means of implementation. Guided by the design science research methodology, published guidelines were used to design and implement a mobile phone interface tailored to the needs of elderly South Africans. The resulting prototype was evaluated with two groups of South African elderly mobile phone users. Besides validating and refining the guidelines, the challenges experienced in implementing guidelines were noted together with some conclusions about the viability and usefulness of the specific guidelines, as well as mobile interface design guidelines in general. The unique contribution of this paper lies in the reflection on crossing the research-action divide by also considering the challenges of the developers in implementing the guidelines.},

This paper reviews and compares existing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for controlling the behaviour of non-human characters in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game environments. Two techniques, the fuzzy state machine (FuSM) and the emotional behaviour tree (EBT), were reviewed and compared. In addition, an alternate and simple mechanism to incorporate emotion in a behaviour tree is proposed and tested. Initial tests of the mechanism show that it is a viable and promising mechanism for effectively tracking the emotional state of an NPC and for incorporating emotion in NPC decision making.},
