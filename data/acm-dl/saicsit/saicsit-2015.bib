abstract = {Evaluation of Information Systems (IS) success is important given the pervasiveness of IS in organizations and society. Much research has examined IS Success, with several attempts made over time at consolidating and synthesizing findings from these myriad studies. In this paper we contribute to this line of research by conducting a systematic review of 55 journal articles on IS success published between 2003 and 2012. Techniques from Grounded Theory Methodology were used to analyse the literature. Enduring categories that emerged from the analysis included User-IT Association, Artefactual Characteristics, Influence Factors, Context, Benefits, Negative Consequences and Net Benefits. The identified categories were used to build a polymorphic model of IS success. The developed polymorphic model illustrates the essence of many IS success models.},

abstract = {Proactive monitoring and control of indoor air quality in homes where there are pregnant mothers and infants is essential for healthy development and well-being of children. This is especially true in low income households where cooking practices and exposure to harmful pollutants produced by nearby industries can negatively impact on a healthy home environment. Interdisciplinary expert knowledge is required to make sense of dynamic and complex environmental phenomena from multivariate low level sensor observations and high level human activities to detect health risks and enact decisions about control. We have developed an ontology for indoor environmental quality monitoring and control based on an ongoing real world case study in Durban, South Africa. We implemented an Indoor Air Quality Index and a thermal comfort index which can be automatically determined by reasoning on the ontology. We evaluated the ontology by populating it with test sensor data and showing how it can be queried to analyze health risk situations and determine control actions. Our evaluation shows that the ontology can be used for real world indoor monitoring and control applications in resource constrained settings.},

abstract = {The advancement in technological development is now altering the conventional order in the diffusion of IT innovation from a top-down approach(organization to employees) to a bottom up approach (employees to organization). This change is more notable in the developed economies and has led to the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) phenomenon. There have been several studies on corporate adoption of BYOD but few have investigated the phenomenon from a small and medium enterprise (SME) perspective and in developing countries specifically. SMEs, like their large organizations counterparts, can significantly benefit from BYOD given that they are usually resource constrained.This study presents a qualitative review of BYOD literature from the perspective of SMEs with the intention of (1) highlighting contextual issues that SMEs in developing countries need to be aware of prior to BYOD adoption; and (2) calling researchers to pay attention to how BYOD as a technology catalyst can address contextual challenges. Following a literature review analysis approach, the study identifies organizational factors as key to the success of BYOD adoption. For BYOD to become part of an organization there needs to be organizational readiness in terms of technology, governance, business resources, awareness and the availability of human resources. Contextual factors of supporting industry, government readiness and market forces were not given much attention but are perceived as important for adoption.},

abstract = {Public Private Partnership (PPP) contracts have drawn considerable media interest due to a number of problems such as cost overruns, mismanagement and failure. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse media discourse relating to the failure of a PPP contract between the South African Department of Labour (DOL) and Siemens Information Services (SIS). The contract pertained to the provision and implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services for the DOL. The theoretical foundation for this research is Habermas' theory of communicative action which focuses on normative standards for communication and implications of public speech. Our research builds on a growing literature on critical discourse analysis (CDA) that systematically applies Habermas' validity claims to empirical research on public communication focused on revealing distortions concerning claims of truth, sincerity, legitimacy and comprehensibility. Our study contributes to understanding issues of public accountability of PPP contracts and extends the reach of critical research into PPP contracting for information systems (IS) services and highlights key challenges of the lack of public sector management competences in securing the public interest in PPP engagements.},

abstract = {Data quality is one of many challenges experienced in e-health. The collection of data with substandard data quality leads to inappropriate information for health and management purposes. Given evidence of challenges with regards to data quality in electronic health systems, the purpose of the study is to prioritise data quality challenges as experienced by data users of electronic healthcare systems in South Africa. The study adopted a sequential QUAL-quan mixed method research design towards the realisation of the research purpose. After carrying out a literature review on the background of e-health and the current status of research on data quality challenges, a qualitative study was conducted to verify and extend the theoretical list of data quality challenges. A quantitative study followed to prioritise data quality challenges as experienced by data users of electronic healthcare systems. Data users of electronic healthcare systems in South Africa served as the unit of analysis in the study. The data collection process included the conducting of interviews with four data quality experts to verify and extend the theoretical list of data quality challenges. This was followed by a survey targeting 100 data users of electronic healthcare systems in South Africa for which 82 responses were received.From the results of the study, a prioritised list of data quality challenges has been developed which can be applied to assist data users of electronic health care systems in South Africa to improve the quality of data in electronic healthcare systems. The most important data challenge is training. The prioritised list of data quality challenges allowed for evidence-based recommendations which can assist health institutions in South Africa to ensure future data quality.},

abstract = {Modelling tools are widely used by national parks, both within South Africa and in countries around the world. The modelling of animal behaviour, particularly in South Africa and other African countries, is well established. These models, however, tend to be developed with one particular application and species in mind and are not reusable in other scenarios, requiring further development work for the addition of another species. This paper presents an approach towards developing an agent-based generic system that simulates a range of mammal behaviours by building a set of core behaviours that can be parameterised according to the needs of each species. The system uses XML notation for the definition of a species and provides a GUI tool that produces the XML required to simulate a species and set up the initial animals present in the simulation. Various feedback tools allow the simulation to be examined and analysed in detail to ascertain the success of the simulation of the mammal behaviours and those behaviours' adaptation to various different species.},

abstract = {Formal protocols for driving swarms of robotic devices towards predictable emergent behaviour are rare in the literature but critical in most upcoming sciences such as nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and amorphous computing. Such collections of robotic device control protocols would foster the development of deliberately engineered swarm outcomes, while at the same time, discouraging the feared evolution of "engines of destruction to nature and mankind". Many inspiring swarm coordination paradigms have been proposed in the literature. However simulated ant inspired metaphors have demonstrated plausible successes in terms of robustness, fault tolerance, speed, and quality of the emergent behaviour thereof. We propose an XSet based protocol with which swarms of stigmergic ant-like robotic devices are driven towards predictable shortest path finding and path following behaviours. The theme features of the proposed XSet based protocol are built on the primitive activities of simulated stigmergic foraging ant agents. In this context, an XSet is an extended set of primitive activities, parameter values, and meta information which stipulates when and how primitive activities are used. Investigations into the composition of the proposed XSet and the sequences in which primitive activities are arranged in the XSet reveal that relatively best swarm performances arise when the proposed XSet triggers robotic devices to respectively, (a) drop specific levels of pheromone chemicals in specific quantities, (b) orientate towards relatively attractive directions based on the levels of pheromone around, (c) move along the direction of orientation, and (d) alternate between different internal states when it becomes necessary. Besides prescribing a new robotic device control paradigm, this work inspires further developments towards generalized robotic device control standards.},

abstract = {Parallel programming can provide higher computational performance over a sequential implementation by making use of the many cores available in parallel systems. However, the parallel-capable devices introduce complexity into the programming model. Current parallel programming API's such as OpenCL and CUDA provide interfaces to the parallel devices, but are complex and result in code which includes cross-cutting components, such as setting up the parallel programming context, compiling the parallel kernel, and transferring data between the host and device memory spaces when the kernel is executed. A C++ Aspect-Oriented based Parallel Programming (CAPP) framework is developed, using AspectC++ and OpenCL, which defines aspects to remove the cross-cutting components from the C++ code. The aspects set up the OpenCL context, compile the OpenCL kernel, and manage the data transfer between the memory spaces each time a kernel is executed. The aspects are woven into the C++ code before compilation, rather than at run time, which improves performance. An interface is provided for executing OpenCL kernels from the C++ code, essentially providing parallel programming in C++. The framework was applied to the SAXPY and Black-Scholes option pricing problems. Computational performance was, on average, 1.4-7% slower than the OpenCL implementation and up to 9 times faster than the sequential C++ implementation for the Black-Scholes problem. The amount of code was greatly reduced from the OpenCL implementation, and the resulting CAPP framework C++ code was simple and modular, resembling the sequential C++ implementation code. The amount of CAPP code required for the examples was found to be comparable to that of C++ AMP, another parallel programming framework.},

An interpretivist case study of Stack Overflow was carried out. Seven categories of motivation were identified from the literature; fun, ideology, reputation, reciprocity, efficacy, attachment, and structural capital. Self-determination theory and the notion of knowledge as a public versus a private good were used as theoretical lenses to understand contributor motivation under each of these categories. Findings from the case identified important emergent themes such as the need for involvement in a community prior to contribution, and the importance of considering factors that discourage contribution in addition to those that encourage contribution when researching the contributor phenomenon.The paper argues that self-determination theory is a useful theoretical lens to apply to the study of contributor motivation, and whilst the notion of knowledge as a public versus a private good is useful to understanding some of the motivations found in the literature, increased complexity of knowledge sharing online communities reduces the utility of this theoretical lens, as evidenced by the case of Stack Overflow.},

The goal of NUIs is to provide a natural means of interaction that is effectively invisible to the user. Commercial Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to meet this need. Towards this end, it was investigated whether a user's prior experience with traditional input methods affects their efficiency with the Emotiv (a commercially available BCI). This was used as an indicator of the suitability of the headset as an NUI. Two groups of participants, categorised based on their prior exposure to traditional input methods, were tested navigating a pair of robots through a test course, first with the Emotiv and then using a standard keyboard. The study determined that the Emotiv would be suitable to use as an NUI, but only when used in a non-critical context that is not time sensitive. The findings are that the technology is presently not yet ready to replace the traditional interface approach. However, the Emotiv offers a more natural alternative when interacting with computers compared to traditional approaches like the keyboard.},

This paper describes a study that sought to improve learners' understanding of programming in the domain of OOP. This was done through the use of a visual programming environment (VPE) called Alice, which was designed to help novice programmers learn OOP concepts, whilst creating animated movies and video games. A questionnaire was administered to obtain quantitative and qualitative data regarding learners' understanding of OOP and their experience with the Alice environment. Findings indicate that learners spend insufficient time on programming exercises and struggle with problem-solving, applying OOP concepts, and abstraction. However, the use of Alice addressed challenges faced by experiment participants within the object-oriented domain and improved their motivation to learn OOP. Further results revealed that the test and exam performance of learners who used Alice, was not statistically better than those of similar learners who were not exposed to the Alice intervention.},

abstract = {This paper is to describes a method for interposing computer generated melody with tone linked to unique entities within the text of a novel.Background: A recent study describing a piece of software called "TransProse" has already shown that sentiment in the text of a novel can be used to automatically generate simple piano music that reflects the same sentiment as the novel. This study wished to establish a method whereby, if after aligning the text with the melody, the sentiment in the words surrounding particular characters as they occurred within the novel could produce another melody line, for each character, that could reflect the individual characters' tone and distinguish the melodies ascribed to each character from each other.Method: The sentiment in the text of the novel is extracted by looking up the words in a database that groups the words into emotional groups called "Ekman categories".Simplistic relations between aspects of music such as pitch and tempo are chosen based on the two categories that contained the most words. These chosen attributes are then used to generate the first two melody lines.The paragraphs within which the named entities referring to characters are found is manually determined and the top "Ekman category" of the named entities is obtained through simplistic methods of extraction. Each bar of the melody is aligned with individual paragraphs of text and an additional melody line is generated for each character.Results: Adjusting the fitness function of the Genetic algorithm (GA) that was used was not sufficient to link the tone of the characters to the melody. Assigning each character their own short melodic phrase and varying the phrase appropriately achieved the desired outcome but requires additional work to harmonise better with the first two melody lines.},

abstract = {Genetic programming is rapidly gaining popularity in research areas for the induction of complex game playing strategies for board games such as Othello, checkers, backgammon and chess endgames. Most of this research has focused on developing evaluation functions for use with standard game playing algorithms such as the alpha-beta algorithm or Monte Carlo tree search, supported by game specific knowledge bases. In previous work we have introduced a novel application of genetic programming to evolve game playing strategies composed of heuristics for board games. Each evolved strategy represents a player. Strategies are evolved in real time, during game play, while in other studies the strategies are generally created offline. The research presented in this paper builds on this work by investigating the use of reinforcement learning and mobility to further improve the evolved game playing strategies. An initial population of players created using the ramped half-and-half method is iteratively refined using reproduction, mutation and crossover. Tournament selection is used to choose parents. The board game Othello, also known as Reversi, is used to illustrate and evaluate this approach. The performance of the genetic programming approach incorporating reinforcement learning, the genetic programming approach incorporating mobility and the genetic programming approach incorporating both reinforcement learning and mobility were compared to that of the previous heuristic based approach. All three approaches were found to produce better results than the previous heuristic based approach, with the genetic programming approach incorporating just reinforcement learning performing the best.},

abstract = {Given the high levels of violence in South Africa, there is widespread concern among the public that video game violence may be increasing the risk of aggression in players and consequently leading to violence. Employing the General Aggression Model (GAM), this study set out to examine the influence of socio-psychological factors such as excessive gaming and pathological gaming, and technology factors such as interactive richness on player aggression. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 101 university students. Regression analysis indicates that only pathological gaming explains a small variance in player aggression. Contrary to prior studies that make strong claims that violent video game playing leads to aggressive behaviour, these factors made only a negligible contribution to predicting player aggression in this study. Future research should focus on testing multiple pathways that culminates into player aggression. Violent gaming technologies may not be influencing aggressive behaviour as much as stimulating pre-aggressive individuals already predisposed by other socio-psychological factors. Future research should test the above factors with more contextual based socio-psychological factors, within the individual aggressor's family and close-knit social environment. Intervention and prevention programs may be better served by insights into the aggressor's personal, family, and social context rather than technology related behaviours.},

abstract = {The proliferation of mobile devices coupled with their increased computing capabilities has made them perfectly fit in the business environment. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is the phenomenon where individuals bring their own portable devices for connectivity and use in the workplace. BYODs introduce several benefits such as increased productivity and employee motivation but also a range of security challenges. Hackers have developed multifaceted malware targeting these BYODs. Research has been done on mobile malware detection however, because of their resource-constraint, the adoption of PC-based malware detection methods such as signature and behavior-based detection techniques has proved to be challenging. Users have cited privacy concerns when these virus detection techniques are remotely applied on the BYOD for example cloud-based detection since these devices are used for both personal and work data storage. This paper examines the threat of mobile malware to organizations that have adopted BYOD and current solutions to this threat. Additionally, a hybrid malware detection framework with privacy protection for BYOD and smart-work environments is proposed to detect malware without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of personal sensitive data.},

abstract = {Crime is a reality that affects everyone, especially in South Africa that has one of the world's highest crime rates. A number of strategies have been undertaken by the South African society at large in the fight against crime. One of these was the establishment of Community Policing Forums (CPFs) which encourages communities to work with the South African Police Service (SAPS) to combat and ultimately reduce crime. A number of these CPFs have embraced Facebook to execute their mandate. Little research has been done on how Facebook is used in South Africa to fight crime. The aim of this study is to understand how CPFs use Facebook in their fight against crime by determining the type of information that is shared among themselves as well as how this information is shared. This was done by employing a thematic content analysis approach of a months' worth of Facebook posts of a particular CPF community in the East Rand of Gauteng, South Africa. This resulted in the analysis of 247 posts. This study found that the CPF community shares two types of information: firstly, information relating to the building of a cohesive community, which in terms of this research is defined as a community with a common vision to achieving more effective crime control. Secondly, information related to the creating of awareness of crime in the area. It was further shown that community members share information between different communities such as private security firms, other CPFs, and other communities dedicated to the fight against crime. They therefore used the power of Facebook to expand the boundaries of their immediate community. It was further found that even though the main operating platform for the CPF is Facebook, community members were encouraged to join the WhatsApp group of their local Neighbourhood Watch (NHW), which highlighted that CPFs operate on multiple platforms. The significance of this research is presented in the Crime Prevention Lifecycle which explains that within a cohesive community, crime can be reduced through the actions of community members. Further research is recommended to extend the understanding of CPFs' and other less structured communities' use of social media focusing on the integration of multiple platforms.},

abstract = {The concept of sustainability has become an important phenomenon globally with many organisations being affected by the heightened awareness in sustainability. Organisations are more aware of the importance of promoting sustainability in all areas of operations. This is no different in the higher education sector, with a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) playing a leading role in promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and educational sustainability. In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability.This paper highlights the importance of effectively managing sustainability information and the challenges HEIs face in sustainability reporting. Business Intelligence (BI) is a solution to overcome the challenges and effectively managing sustainability information. However, HEIs need to overcome a number of challenges associated with BI to ensure a BI solution is correctly implemented and is effective in solving the problem of effective sustainability information management. This study focusses on the management of sustainability information in South African HEIs. The results indicate that there are many challenges to managing sustainability information in South African HEIs, including siloed data and information as well as poor sharing and communication of information. These two challenges can be overcome by a correctly implemented BI solution.},

The purpose of this paper is then to contribute to a broader understanding of evaluation as part of the DSR process through the presentation of the practical application of evaluation activities based on program theory in the DSR process of Peffers et al. The evaluation and iterative improvement of the Teacher Professional Development Course as part of the ICT for Rural Education is presented as the artifact which was evaluated. This example from practice can contribute towards an enhanced understanding of the evaluation of DSR artifacts and the contribution of program theory during both the ex ante and ex post part of the development.},

abstract = {In blog-based online social networks specifically, and online social networks generally, increasing user participation is a key determinant of success and sustainability. In past research, the issue has been addressed mostly by focusing on individual actors (i.e. the humans participating in these networks) or groups of individuals. Rarely are these networks studied from a system-centric vantage point. The present study uses this paradigm and employs system dynamics, an approach to exploring and modeling complex systems, to study Bonfiire, a case of a blog-based online social network. Through an iterative methodology, a conceptual model of the socio-technical system is presented and then converted into a simulation model, to allow for the simulation of behaviour and the interrogation of assumptions. On the basis of these checks for rigour, the simulation model is used to find leverage points to increase user participation. Finally, a low-input, high-impact policy to address this issue is proposed and evaluated. The results show promise not only for understanding the issue of user participation, but also for the usefulness and applicability of a system dynamics approach to this issue.},

abstract = {Digraphs are used to model real world systems and therefore the need arises to be able to determine the similarity between two relatively large digraphs. This similarity is in terms of both the structure of the digraphs and the knowledge represented by their vertices and edges.Two algorithms are presented which derive their basic functionality from the Levenshtein distance algorithm. The Levenshtein algorithm is used in string comparisons to determine similarity. These two algorithms, not only calculate the edit distance between two digraphs, but preserve the operations used to convert one digraph into the other.The results of the two algorithms are discussed in terms their edit distance cost results and their execution speed. These results are contrasted with one another and with the Levenshtein distance algorithm adapted for representing digraphs. The results indicate that the two proposed algorithms are more accurate in terms of their edit distance calculations than the Levenshtein distance algorithm, but that the Levenshtein algorithm out performs them in terms of execution speed.},

The use of modules in ontologies at the knowledge layer is receiving increased attention, and a plethora of approaches, algorithms, and tools exist, which, however, yield only very limited success. This is mainly because wrong combinations of techniques are being used. To solve this issue, we examine the modules' use-cases, types, techniques, and properties from the literature. This is used to create a framework for ontology modularity, such that a user with a certain use case will know the type of modules needed, and therewith then also the appropriate technique to realise it and what properties the resultant modules will have. This framework is then evaluated with three case studies, begin the QUDT, FMA, and OpenGalen ontologies.},

abstract = {The importance of Business Intelligence (BI) within organisations is increasing with insights being used across organisations for tasks ranging from daily management decision support to executive strategic planning. With the increasingly important role the internet plays in consumers' lives, an abundance of valuable data is to be found online. This data can be used to enhance the ability of BI to deliver important information to all levels within the organisation. Yet including web data in traditional BI practice has not yet delivered value seamlessly. Hence the primary question asked in this paper is: What are the organisational barriers which prevent the inclusion of unstructured web data in BI practice? By means of a single case study within an Insurance company in the Western Cape, and by using a hybrid inductive and deductive research approach, this research identifies the key barriers in this organisation to the adoption of this advanced BI innovation. The major factors were found to be the lack of management support, poor understanding of the potential benefits of using web data, the reliability and privacy concerns related to this data, and no innovation champion driving the adoption. The resultant causal model of barriers can be used by organisations wanting to adopt this BI innovation to suggest possible actions which can be undertaken to eliminate some of the barriers.},

abstract = {Over the past few years smartphones have evolved from being basic devices that support stock-standard, static Operating Systems (OSs) to powerful devices that are capable of running dynamic, customizable OSs. In turn, these OSs also support the installation of additional, mobile applications (apps) on the fly. With an increase in the number of apps that users may choose to install on their smartphones, the vulnerability of the information stored on the device potentially also increases as a result. This is due to the fact that cyber criminals are able to write apps that can often gain access to not only personal user information, but also sensitive organizational information stored on these smartphone devices.In this paper we have a look at smartphone OS trends over the past 5 years on both a global and a local scale. We subsequently identify Android as the top grossing OS in both scenarios making it the most popular OS in the world. We proceed with an investigation of various aspects relating to smartphone apps including a discussion on some of the official app distribution platforms (referred to as marketplaces), the problems experienced by marketplaces due to malicious apps being distributed and also the current techniques being employed in an attempt to minimize the publication of malicious apps. We continue our discussion on apps by looking at the typical process followed for downloading and also updating an app -- these are in turn used to form a complete user journey map of a generic app marketplace.Finally, we focus our attention to the smartphone user. By introducing the Smartphone User Competency Evolution (SUCE) model as well as the Smartphone Application User Security Competency Evolution (SAUSCE) model, we discuss the significance of determining an individual user's level of understanding and competence relating to the usage of their smartphone and the apps installed on it.We conclude by noting that the SAUSCE model could potentially aid individual users and/or their organizations at providing level appropriate training and awareness to aid smartphone users in their ongoing battle against smartphone abusers. The efficacy that such a model may have when used in conjunction with other best practices however, relies greatly on the successful implementation of `if the shoe fits, put it on' understanding, regulation and enforcement. As a result, it will no longer be a question of if the shoe fits, put it on, but rather, if the smartphone security level fits, put (switch) it on.},

Being a relative new process specification the understanding of complexity metrics for CMMN ought to be beneficial for practitioners and researchers by providing a way to compare case management models.This study provides a formal description of CMMN and three metrics are defined, namely size, length, and complexity. The metrics are theoretically validated using the formal framework for software measurements defined by Briand et al. and the complexity metric is further validated using Weyuker's properties for software complexity measures.},

Often these heuristics are based on different formats of the input formulae, rather than the functionality of the reasoner, e.g. the OTTER theorem prover or its underlying inference mechanism - Resolution. The researchers believe that these heuristics may be applicable to automated reasoning programs implementing different, yet related inference mechanisms. Consequently, research was undertaken to test this hypothesis for a connection tableau-based reasoner. Preliminary investigations confirmed a number of these heuristics to be useful for connection tableau reasoning as implemented by leanCop 2.1. A case study is presented, showing how properties of high level conceptual constructs and knowledge of the given problem domain represented in set theory could be proved using the heuristics.},

The knowledge required to build models to accurately predict treatment adherence behaviour is extensive and presents challenges in low resource settings where knowledge and data is scarce. To resolve the knowledge gap, we developed an ontology supported by current scientific literature to categorise, clarify and consolidate influencing factors affecting tuberculosis patients' treatment adherence behaviour in a consistent manner. The ontology will support an open, sharable and reusable treatment adherence behaviour knowledge repository to enhance evidence-based decision making for tuberculosis management. In particular the use of the ontology to construct a Bayesian decision network model for particular tuberculosis communities is demonstrated.},

This paper challenges whether the current presentation format is an optimal communication medium. An alternative communication medium is proposed in the form of a map-based schedule. The value of maps as communication devices is determined by means of a qualitative study into the areas affecting the comprehension and construction of maps. Following from this a prototype map-based schedule is developed as a proof of concept in order to determine its feasibility as a communication medium and case studies are employed to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of maps as a technique for visualizing load-shedding schedules. It was found that maps present advantages over the current table-based schedule provided by Eskom. However it is also clear that the proposed solution is not a panacea for all potential tasks. While new spatial information is made available, a map-based approach results in the loss of significant temporal information. Maps and tables were found to fulfill complementary roles, leading to the recommendation that they be employed simultaneously as load-shedding schedule communication devices.},

abstract = {Industry in South Africa is becoming increasingly aware of the need for user experience design in the development of products and services. Problems experienced with usability prevent people from accessing, and eventually adopting technology, and a deep understanding of the users' needs is needed for building a successful service. User experience activities, such as user research, can be used to understand how people live their lives, in order to more effectively respond to user needs with informed, relevant and innovative design solutions.Together with this increased awareness and appetite, is the emergent challenge where those who constitute the field of user experience (practitioners, service providers, content providers, scholars and those requiring user experience services) often understand the field differently and in different ways.The aim of this paper is to describe the current landscape of the field of user experience in South Africa and gain insights into the field's maturity such that further research and recommendations may assist in its positive growth. A survey was used to gather feedback from 105 respondents currently involved in the user experience field in South Africa. The user research methodology focused on: defining the goals of the survey; determining the user profiles; planning the survey; running the survey; analysing and reporting the results. Results provided insights into the demographics, experience, education, job titles, salaries, challenges of user experience practitioners, and the user experience community of practice in South Africa.},

abstract = {Gamification and digital badging are new concepts to the educational environment, where on completion of specific tasks, an individual can earn a badge or badges showing their achievement. Currently Mozilla Open Badges is the standard for the issuing, managing and receiving of digital badges in connected environments. These Mozilla Badges are issued to learners by facilitators or organisational representatives acting as a form of accreditation for the skills said individual has learnt. The issuing of Mozilla Open Badges faces major challenges within resource constrained environments. This is due to the lack of internet connectivity within these areas which is a core requirement for the successful operation of Mozilla Open Badges. Therefore as a major contribution, this paper aims at introducing a model that will solve the problem of issuing badges within resource constrained environments. The study made use of the interpretive philosophy, following the inductive approach with the three-cycle view of design science research. Three project experts were interviewed in order to identify the components that are critical in providing a model for facilitating the issuing of digital badges in a resource constrained environment. Through feedback from users, and in conjunction with the literature review, a final model for facilitating the issuing of digital badges in a resource-constrained environment has been proposed. The proposed model is useful and applicable to any developing or disconnected environment throughout the world.},

abstract = {Taxonomy-Based Software Construction (TABASCO) applies extensive domain analyses to create conceptual hierarchies of algorithmic domains. Those are used as basis for the implementation of software toolkits. The monolithic structure of TABASCO-based toolkits restricts their adoption on resource-constrained or special-purpose devices. In this paper, we address this problem by applying Software Product Line (SPL) techniques to TABASCO-based toolkits: We use software taxonomies as input to creating a conceptual representation of variability as feature models of an SPL. We apply the variability realization mechanism delta modeling to transform realization artifacts, such as source code, to only contain elements for a particular selection of features. Our method is suitable for proactive, reactive and extractive SPL development so that it supports a seamless adoption and evolution of an SPL approach for TABASCO-based toolkits. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method with three case studies by proactively, reactively and extractively transforming TABASCO-based toolkits to SPLs, which allow derivation of variants with custom-tailored functionality.},

abstract = {Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents traditionally use a fixed, pre-defined plan library with the assumption that the environments in which they operate remain unchanged. Often agents have to operate in changing environments with the results that plans become outdated or even fail completely. The result has been much research on several approaches to re-planning mechanisms for BDI agents. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are well known as an optimization technique with wide application, however they have not been applied as a re-planning mechanism for BDI agents. This paper explores the application of GAs as a mechanism for re-planning in BDI agents in a controlled, simulated environment and shows that GAs are a feasible re-planning mechanism for BDI agents.},

abstract = {The use of interactive dashboards has become a popular technique to aid users in Business Intelligence (BI) analysis and data discovery. The increase in the number of BI platforms on the market is driven by the expanding end-user population. A wider range of novice users, such as business users with minimal Information Technology (IT) or data science skills, are demanding BI tools that support rapid and easy dashboard development. Dashboard development is often a tedious process, involving a number of developers and software tools. Self-service BI tools are becoming prominent environments in which novice users can fulfil their BI requirements without the intervention of IT experts. However, the usability of BI tools has not fully matured to a level where novice users can utilise its features efficiently and effectively without the assistance from IT experts.Limited research has been conducted regarding usability criteria specific to BI tools that support novice users. The purpose of this paper is to expand on existing BI usability criteria for supporting novice users with their data analysis activities. Furthermore, the study proposes a set of design guidelines that can be used as a reference for designing, evaluating and selecting BI tools that aid novice users. Evaluations were carried out on current BI tools to investigate its usability and the extent to which these tools follow the proposed guidelines. Additionally, a field study was conducted with novice users to evaluate the difficulties of current BI tools. This study is concerned with the design of front-end features and usability of BI tools and not on the design of dashboards itself. The results indicated that the proposed design guidelines can be effectively used to select a BI tool for novices. },

This can potentially negatively impact on their designs, especially if they design with users like themselves in mind. The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to expose students to the non-homogeneity of users from different out-groups, characterised by age differences. Student researchers were tasked to explore the mobile usages and perceptions of out-group members. The younger and older mobile phone users challenged the students' preconceptions about how they would use their phones. This awareness is likely to translate into improved interface designs for users across the age spectrum.},

abstract = {Many South Africans are functionally illiterate, which impacts adversely on their further education and job prospects. As literacy deficits begin in primary school, it is vitally important to improve reading engagement in children aged 6 to 13 years.In this study, we explored the use of mobile applications to improve children's engagement with, and enjoyment of, reading. Two alternative approaches were prototyped: the StoryMaker tablet application allows children to create a digital story book incorporating characters from the popular Nal'ibali reading-for-enjoyment supplements, while the StoryGame application uses a less traditional gamification approach, where the user directs a character through a story by solving word problems.The applications were tested on groups of children aged 10 to 12. While both applications met with enthusiasm, the children reported that the StoryGame application encouraged them to read more, while they would prefer to play with the StoryMaker application. The long-term benefits of these applications are still to be established, but this pilot study should inform the design of future applications to encourage reading in children.},

abstract = {eModeration (or online moderation) can improve the user experience of the examination process while lowering the risk of losing scripts or delaying the moderation process. Despite these benefits to optimising examination procedures, the application of online moderation is limited. There could be various reasons for the lack of adopting eModeration including the technical, organisational and human factors. The focus of this study is on the human factors involved in eModeration and the research is guided by the following question: What are the most important user experience constructs for evaluating an electronic moderation (eModeration) system within the context of Higher Education Institutions in South Africa? This research uses a design science methodology, which comprises the development and testing of a user experience framework. In this paper, we will only report on the identification of the constructs for the user experience framework. The data generation methods will include interviews with deans from the different faculties and a survey with moderators and deans. The research was conducted at Midrand Graduate Institute, a Private Higher Education Institution in South Africa. The contribution of the paper is to identify the most important user experience constructs for evaluating an eModeration system and also to provide some insights on the user experience of the two different user groups. The enriched understanding of eModerators' and deans' user experience of eModeration contributes to the understanding of the human factors that influence the adoption of innovative assessment practices.},

abstract = {Many algorithms in graph theory add or remove either edges or nodes (or both) to solve a given problem. Graph augmentation typically concerns the addition of edges to a graph to satisfy some connectivity property of the graph. This paper focuses on the addition of vertices to a graph to satisfy a specific connectivity property: ensuring that all the nodes of the graph are contained within cycles. A distinction is made between graph augmentation (edge addition), and graph enlargement (vertex addition).The particular problem addressed here is the enlarging of a digraph which is an abstraction defined in the "shoe matching problem" and represents people who require different sizes of shoes. To be able to satisfy all of the participants, every node (person) in the digraph must be contained in at least one cycle. This paper looks at ways to improve on the original approach to graph enlargment. It redefines the cost model used in the original work, presents three improvements to the original approach and shows that these approaches do indeed offer benefits in terms of the number of nodes needed to solve the problem and/or the speed of enlargement.},

The DSR relevance cycle ensured engagement with the needs of the teaching communities while the rigor cycle guided the implementation of the curriculum and the evaluations by the stakeholders. The contribution of this paper is the mobile digital literacy curriculum and the lessons learnt from implementation and testing of the curriculum in the education context. In addition, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the DSR approach for knowledge creation and the evaluation of the artefact.},

abstract = {The popularity of e-learning has cumulated in a wealth of research in this field, however, there is limited research related to the technological aspects of what makes e-learning components (content and interactive features) successful. Existing criteria that are available are primarily based on criteria used for evaluating new, untested systems such as web systems. It is often the case that these criteria are inappropriate for deciding on what learning components to use in an e-learning environment and ultimately for evaluating the successful use of components in an e-learning environment.The purpose of this paper was to investigate and classify heuristics for e-learning environments with the primary focus on the different components of e-learning. A case study approach was used in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) course at a South African university. The ERP e-Learning Environment (ERPeL) was designed using the guidelines and criteria proposed. Specific components incorporated into the ERPeL were badges, a leader board, live chats and a mobile learning (m-learning) application (app). Opinions of the ERPeL and its components were collected using a mixed methods approach. Useful feedback was received from the students using the proposed criteria. An analysis of the results was then used to improve the design of these components in subsequent Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles.},
