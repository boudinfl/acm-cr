abstract = {Reportedly more than 50% of the people working in the ICT sector have made a career change from another field or have joined it after qualifying in another discipline. The number of women choosing to join the ICT work force at a later stage in their careers is markedly higher than the number who make this decision early. This paper reports on an extensive survey among students at four very different South African universities regarding the factors they consider important in deciding on an ideal career. Since, in the case of older students a decision to start studying computing may point to a decision to change career, the responses given by males and females and between different age groups have been compared. The aim is to identify whether reasons for career choices differ between the four groups. The research has found that self-efficacy and career progress have different importance for the different age groups. In addition, quality of life issues, financial resources and flexibility related to career are valued differently by males and females. However, there is only one factor that can be identified as viewed differently by both the different genders and one of the different age groups. This is computer self-efficacy where older women reduce the significant gap in this regard as they get older.},

Current web service discovery techniques are ineffective in supporting users in finding suitable web services. Information visualization (IV) has been used to assist users of large datasets by presenting this data visually. IV has not, however, been generally used to support web service discovery.In this paper, we introduce SerViz - a prototype tool for interactive visualization of web service collections. This tool uses a network IV technique to visualize a web service collection. The paper also discusses a user study comparing the network IV technique with the alphabetical list used in current web service discovery methods. The objectives of the user study were to compare these techniques and identify any usability problems in SerViz.Results obtained in this study showed that the network IV technique was the preferred method to visualize web service collections and only minor usability problems were identified. The results showed that the network technique was more efficient for browsing a large web service collection.},

abstract = {Research in the field of strategic information systems planning (SISP) has primarily focused on information systems (IS) strategy formulation. Despite the great effort put into understanding and executing SISP, organisations still grapple with effectively translating strategic information systems plans into effective implementations. Effective IS strategy plan implementation is fundamental to the survival, profitability and shaping the future of an organisation. Contextual conditions are acknowledged as having a major bearing on the success of IS implementations in organizations. Since limited attention has been given to this situation of concern with respect to SISP, this study aimed to understand how contextual factors influence strategic IS plan implementation. A triangulated research design of an exploratory nature was employed, using qualitative data collected from 11 professionals across 6 organisations. Within each organisation, data was collected through semi-structured interviews from a business person and an IS person involved in strategic IS plan implementation. Company strategic IS plans were also studied. The results of the data analysis enrich understanding of how factors related to the SISP practice context, the IS function context, the stakeholder and management context, the organisational context and the environmental context shape strategic IS plan implementation.},

abstract = {This paper presents an exploration into the relationship between Chomsky problem complexity, as defined by Theory of Computation, and the computational requirements to evolve solutions to these problems. Genetic programming is used to explore these computational requirements by evolving Turing machines that accept the languages posed. Quantifiable results are obtained by applying various metrics to the evolutionary success of these evolved Turing machines. The languages posed are samples out of three language classes from the Chomsky hierarchy, with each class having increasing levels of complexity based on the hierarchy. These languages are evolved on a two-tape Turing machine representation by making use of genetic operators found to be effective in the literature. By exploring the effects of the genetic programming algorithm population sizes and coupled genetic operator rates, it was found that the evolutionary success rates of the classes of Regular and Context-Sensitive problems have no statistical difference in computational requirements, while the Context-Free class was found to be more difficult than the other two Chomsky problem classes through the statistical significance discovered when compared to the other classes.},

abstract = {The accreditation of academic programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology and other related programs is increasing annually. Academic accreditation is a quality assurance mechanism for tertiary education. Accreditation ensures that a department or program meets a set of independently specified quality criteria and allows for articulation and course recognition by professional bodies and industry acceptance. International accreditation of academic programs is specifically important in developing countries, providing graduates entering the international job market an internationally recognised qualification. The Computer Society of South Africa (CSSA) and The South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SAICSIT) provide individual professional accreditation and links with other professional bodies, such as IFIP. In South Africa there is no professional body accrediting ICT degree programs or disciplines.The accreditation of degree programs and the use of Industry Advisory Boards are seen as interventions that could assist in changing the perceptions of students pursuing ICT careers and departmental compliance to international academic standards. This paper examines the current state of degree programme and professional accreditation internationally. The results of an accreditation survey undertaken amongst all departments offering ICT related degree programs at tertiary institutions in South Africa are reported. The authors recommend that the CSSA and SAICSIT investigate the establishment of a South African Accreditation Authority that is associated with international ICT accreditation authorities. A South African accreditation authority will provide degree program accreditation and this will result in significant cost savings to departments.},

The new technologies create new ICT positions, such as Social Networking Manager, IT Architect, Knowledge Manager and Web Specialist. Existing job descriptions such as Systems Analyst, Project Manager and Programmer still exist. ICT graduates today can pursue a large range of ICT careers. The IS2010 ACM curriculum guidelines provide a range of Information Systems career tracks that students could pursue on completion of a specific degree program. ICT students graduating from tertiary institutions are generally not aware of the possible ICT career opportunities and career tracks available and are uninformed about the job descriptions of a computing professional.The research study conducted among Computer Science and Information Systems under-graduates and post-graduates indicated that the students were generally ignorant of possible ICT career tracks and opportunities available in industry. The study showed that there is a significant statistical difference between career knowledge students indicated they perceived they possessed and their actual career knowledge. Academics and students need to acquire a thorough knowledge of ICT career paths and career tracks. The paper suggests methods to educate and provide the relevant information on ICT career opportunities to new ICT graduates and educators.},

abstract = {Terrain constitutes an important part of many virtual environments. In computer games or simulations it is often useful to allow the user to modify the terrain since this can help to foster immersion. Unfortunately, real-time deformation schemes can be expensive and most game engines simply substitute proxy geometry or use texturing to create the illusion of deformation.We present a new terrain deformation framework which is able to produce persistent, real-time deformation by utilising the capabilities of current generation GPUs. Our method utilises texture storage, a terrain level-of-detail scheme and a tile-based terrain representation to achieve high frame rates. To accommodate a range of hardware, we provide deformation schemes for hardware with and without geometry tessellation units. Deformation using the fragment shader (no tessellation) is significantly faster than the geometry shader (tessellation) approach, although this does come at the cost of some high resolution detail.Our tests show that both deformation schemes consume a comparatively small proportion of the GPU per frame budget and can thus be integrated into more complex virtual environments.},

In requirements engineering, an important issue is to provide a basis for judging and selecting one specification above others. This paper proposes through a case study, an approach to evaluate and compare two Object-Z specifications of the same set of requirements and hence, provides a means to select the most appropriate one. The approach recommends identifying properties expected from a satisfactory specification, uses existing validation techniques to evaluate proposed specifications and defines guidelines for comparison to facilitate the choice.},

Today, modern mobile phones offer their users a large selection of features which are accessed via hierarchical menus. These hierarchical menus typically result in deep nested menus that require numerous clicks to navigate through, often resulting in usability issues. This paper presents a prototype of a new menu style (Barrel menu) for mobile phones, and compares the usability of this menu style with that of a traditional hierarchical (Hub-and-Spoke) design. The Barrel menu was found to be as efficient as the Hub-and-Spoke menu in terms of time-on-task and key presses, but was found to cause fewer user errors. In addition, the Barrel menu was found to be better in terms of ease of use, orientation, user satisfaction and learnability. Thus, the Barrel menu shows the potential to be a feasible alternative for mobile phone manufacturers to overcome some of the usability issues associated with Hub-and-Spoke menus.},

Business Process Management (BPM) the latest approach is no exception. While BPM has had significant press, hype status and high adoption expectations, problems with adoption and justifying benefits to business exist. To increase understanding of these adoption concerns, this paper explores BPM in a leading Southern African supermarket retailer where various attempts had been made to implement a formal BPM discipline. The research describes the organisation's understanding of BPM and factors influencing its adoption. Qualitative research methods were used to collect rich narrative data from interviews with information systems (IS) and retail professionals. The BPM adoption themes that emerged focused on the understanding and education of BPM, cultural limitations, centralisation as a strategic driver, ERP as an enabler, structural and people factors. A theoretical model was developed to explain the themes and their inter-relationships. This empirical research provides a conceptual understanding of BPM and its adoption from professionals employed by the retail industry.},

Such phones typically also lack the support for complex applications and certain documents such as Office documents (PPT, DOC and XLS). This paper compares two methods for the conversion from PPT to a format widely supported by a subset of feature phones. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is proposed as the converted format as it is supported by JSR 226 enabled feature phones. The two methods proposed are named "No Bitmap Tracing Conversion" (NoBTC) and "Bitmap Tracing Conversion" (BTC). Both methods use GZip compression to reduce the sizes of the resultant SVG files. The methods are evaluated and compared using performance metrics such conversion time, SVG file size, SVGZ (compressed SVG) file size and the compression ratio of SVG to SVGZ. The effectiveness of conversion is also evaluated and is indicated by the quality of the resultant SVG files and whether the SVG files are supported by JSR 226 enabled feature phones. Evaluation results indicated that BTC took longer to convert PPT to SVGZ but yielded smaller SVG and SVGZ files. BTC also yielded better compression ratios when compressing SVG to SVGZ. BTC yielded SVG files with less quality than the SVG files generated by NoBTC. NoBTC however yielded SVG files that were generally not supported by JSR 226 enabled feature phones.},

abstract = {Group learning plays an essential role in enhancing student understanding, sharing of knowledge and critical thinking. As a result, many institutions are adopting group learning as an alternative to traditional methods. However, there are still many challenges facing students learning in groups. These include lack of leadership, time and scheduling of workload, free riding, individual and social barriers, lack of team development, lack of motivation and social loafing. The integration of the mobile context and technologies in group learning can assist in minimizing some of these barriers. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are believed to bring a transformation on teaching and learning processes through the facilitation of communication and interaction among teachers and learners. Researchers have also found that tacit knowledge has much greater importance to industry and academia. For instance, it allows individuals to achieve goals they personally value. It can be used to measure or predict job performance and those possessing it have been found to manage themselves and others better. This study investigates the extent to which students share tacit knowledge using the mobile phone in group projects and examines if they achieve better performance. One hundred and fifty (150) undergraduate students from different disciplines participated in the survey. The results show that not many students share tacit knowledge using mobile technology. Students in Information Systems (IS) shared relatively more tacit knowledge than those in the Computer Science (CS), Civil Engineering (CE) and Psychology (PSY) disciplines. They mainly shared practical experience on using presentation and project planning tools, web design applications or Microsoft Office. (CE) students shared the least of tacit knowledge using mobile technology. In addition, we discovered that students who share more tacit knowledge perform much better in group projects i.e., students in the IS discipline performed well. We also conducted tests to establish whether discipline has an effect on sharing of tacit knowledge. It was discovered that discipline may influence sharing of knowledge types e.g., TK1 (discuss project tasks and allocation of responsibilities) and TK2 (theoretical knowledge) and not TK3 (seeking clarification from Professors). Thus, the lack of tacit knowledge sharing observed in non-(IS) disciplines can be attributed to factors other than the nature of the discipline.},

abstract = {Animating models using traditional 3D modelling and animation packages is complex and difficult for novice users to use. A sketch-based articulated figure animation tool is introduced that provides users with an intuitive interface to pose and animate skeletons of any topology easily. An isomorphic mapping between the sketch and the skeleton is determined and a recursive algorithm poses the skeleton so that it matches the pose sketched. It is shown how sketch- and depth ambiguity can be resolved using disambiguation information and pressure sensitivity. The tool developed allowed novice users to successfully and easily sketch stick figures to pose articulated figures for sketch-based animation.},

abstract = {Non-English-speaking users, such as Arabic speakers, are not always able to express terminology in their native languages, especially in scientific domains. Such difficulty forces many Arabic authors and scholars to use English terms in order to explain precise concepts, particularly when they address technical topics, resulting in mixed/multilingual queries with both English and Arabic terms. Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) allows users to search documents that are written in a language different from the query. However, current algorithms are optimized for monolingual queries, even if they are translated. This paper attempts to address the problem of multilingual querying in CLIR. New techniques that are better suited to the unique characteristics of this problem, in terms of indexing and weighting, are proposed. A new multilingual and mixed test collection containing mixed-language (Arabic and English) computer science documents and mixed-language queries has been created. Experimentally, results show that current CLIR techniques were not designed for these types of multilingual queries and documents and are found to perform poorly whereas the proposed techniques are found to be promising.},

This paper presents a formal type system for atomic value types as an extension of the simply typed lambda calculus with subtyping. In the λc-calculus, value types can be derived through the application of value space constraints. Type inference rules can be used to infer transient value space constraints that hold for limited scopes of a program. The type system of the λc-calculus is proved to be sound. The λc-calculus was fully implemented in Java and C#. The presented approach was successfully validated to subsume XML Schema Definition type construction and to facilitate the integration of XSD data types with the C# programming language.},

Two construction heuristics, namely, largest degree and saturation degree are studied. The GA's are applied to a data set of six real world problems made available for the Greek school timetabling problem. This study has revealed that the use of construction heuristics improves the performance of the GA to produce better quality timetables. Furthermore, different construction heuristics produce better results for different problems.},

abstract = {Research on ICT service delivery has focused largely on the perspective of the customer. Such a stance loses sight of the symbiotic existence that business has with ICT service providers. This study sought to gain insight into the service provider's perspective of service delivery. 12 ICT professionals from 6 ICT service providers were interviewed, and the data analysed using open coding techniques. The initial assumption was that there were a set of inhibitors and a set of enablers of successful ICT service delivery. The investigation confirms the existence of enablers and inhibitors, but also shows that there is a third set of factors, labeled hygiene factors. Service delivery is negatively impacted if these hygiene factors are absent, but is not necessarily enhanced if they are present. The research has identified 6 key categories deemed to have an influence on service delivery. The interrelatedness of these categories and their influence on specific aspects of service delivery need further research and elaboration. The findings provide ICT service providers with pointers as to the salient issues that need to be addressed in order to improve service delivery. The set of hygiene factors, together with enablers and inhibitors provide for a holistic set of issues to take note of. These results enrich the understanding of factors important for ICT service delivery.},

abstract = {Smell simulation technology allows humans to use their sense of smell to enhance or accelerate their interaction with computers. The technology can be categorised as being either perceiving or generating odours. In this paper, the major capabilities and application areas of both these categories are highlighted. Typical application areas include the food industry, multimedia, marketing, chemistry, art, medical and health sciences, etc.Since its first usage in the 1950s, the lack of acceptance and instability of the technology motivated scientists to try to improve the technology and adapt it for human needs. In this study, questionnaires were used to determine whether computer users are ready to accept smell generation as a means of interaction during online shopping. The current social acceptability of the technology as well as the factors which might deter end-user's willingness to use the technology was investigated. It was found that the interest of people in the use of this technology as interaction modality is, to some extent, affected by gender as well as by the amount of Internet experience and that technical difficulties such as cost, potential health risks and lack of accuracy stand in the way of general acceptability.},

Some of the most probable causes of failure were identified as: high ICT illiteracy rates among the student community; low comfort levels with technology; usability issues of learning management systems; poor marketing strategies; ineffective maintenance strategies and insufficient user/technical support. The dimensions of these causes of failure are discussed, as are the probable interventions likely to avert some of them.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain how to evaluate the effectiveness of web conferencing tools. The DeLone and McLean [8] Information Systems (IS) Success Model was used as the theoretical lens by which to examine effectiveness, which was taken to be synonymous with success, in line with much IS literature. A qualitative approach was used to uncover richness through the process of interviews with users of one web conferencing system. A total of 8 individuals were interviewed, seven of them from the user company and the eighth individual was a client of that company. The majority of respondents agreed that web conferencing improved productivity within the virtual team environment. The participants identified that the issue of sound quality might be a barrier to the use of web conferencing. All the interviewees saw web conferencing as a valuable tool, stating that the beneficial nature of the technology outweighed the few technical problems that were experienced.},

Despite the recent increase in the availability of gyroscope sensors on mobile phones, most implementations of tilt interaction still rely on accelerometer input. Accelerometer sensors are susceptible to noise and also detect linear acceleration. This can lead to controllability problems, particularly when the user is mobile. This paper looks at how the fusion of accelerometer, gyroscope and digital compass sensor data impacts upon tilt interaction in a mobile map-based application. The results of an experiment comparing accelerometer-only tilt interaction with a sensor fusion approach are presented. The results show that while both the accelerometer and sensor fusion approaches performed well for seated tasks, the sensor fusion approach was shown to have advantages in terms of perceived controllability and efficiency while participants were walking.},

abstract = {Splicing is a common image manipulation technique, where the content of more than one image is combined to form a composite image. With recent developments in image editing software, almost anyone can splice images. Splicing can be used to tamper with photographs to depict an event that never occurred. With the developments in digital stereoscopic (3D) cameras and images, it has become a necessity to be able to detect splicing in stereoscopic images. Several techniques have been developed to help a digital forensic investigator identify spliced digital images. However, there is a lack of research on exploiting depth information when detecting splicing in stereoscopic images.This paper proposes a technique to detect simple non-stereoscopic to stereoscopic splicing with the aid of disparity maps. An experiment was performed to test the technique on 35 spliced stereoscopic images. Results indicate that the proposed technique could be used to aid detection. However, detected areas require post-investigation to confirm splicing.},

abstract = {Even though Deaf people in South Africa use texting via cell phones to communicate with hearing people they seldom use it amongst themselves. It is assumed that video messaging will be more accessible for the Deaf as their level of literacy may prevent them from making effective use of information that is disseminated via mass texting. The principal objective of the research was thus to explore a cost effective and efficient mass multimedia messaging system. The intention was to adapt a successful text-based mass notification system, developed by a local non-governmental organization, to accommodate efficient and affordable video mass messaging for Deaf people. The questions that underpin this research are: How should we compare and evaluate various video streaming messaging methods to find the most effective streaming method to deliver video messages? What transport vehicles should we consider: multimedia messaging service, the web, electronic mail or a cell phone resident push/pull application? What is the cost to the end-user and service provider and how can we make such a service more affordable? How does the video quality in terms of sign language vary between each transport vehicle? A mixed research methodology approach was followed to help answer the research questions. The preliminary results indicate that most Deaf people prefer to use the short message service prototype with a web-link to the video rather than the multimedia messaging service prototype with the video attached. Although Deaf people prefer to use the video short message service prototype they are still very concerned about the cost of using the system. They also are concerned about the quality of the sign language video.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how to empower rural farmers to do business by means of inexpensive mobile technologies. In particular, the aim is to take advantage of the inexpensive features of low-end mobile phones to access market related information and to allow farmers to promote their commodities competitively.The research targeted rural Transkei farmers in the Eastern Cape. The farmers' requirements were identified and a prototype for a low- as well as high-end mobile environment was designed to address these requirements.The following features were effected: registration of users, posting of commodities, retrieval of information, and communication with others. The access to the system is through a website (on the phone or a personal computer) or by means of unstructured supplementary service data.The prototype was implemented and tested. The users found the technology easy to use.},

The study analyzed actions and behavior of users, in order to identify the factors that determine the use of knowledge management systems. The empirical evidence was obtained through open-ended questionnaires, interviews and direct observations at the work environment. The study revealed that there was lack of employee participation and involvement during the implementation of the KMS, and this was identified, among other factors, as the contributing factor to user resistance and reluctance to use the system, thereof. The value and strategic intent of the knowledge management system was not clear to most employees; thus, instead of using the implemented system to share, create, store and transfer knowledge, employees instead reverted to using varied other mechanism to interact with colleagues.},

Social relationships and networks were found to have three impact types on IS projects being a) influence, b) friendships and c) advice. Social relationships and networks were found to impact IS projects in areas of leadership, project culture, social relationships within project teams, the use of external social networks and the managing of external influences.Grounded theory techniques were used to conduct the research. Project documentation were used to identify core categories which were supplemented with a survey directed at all levels of project team members. Interpretive patterns from grounded theory enabled inferences to be drawn on the role of social relationships and networks within IS projects.The research findings provide practical considerations and highlights potential problem areas in the project lifecycle that need to be taken cognisance of irrespective of the chosen project management methodology.},

This paper describes Wii3D, an interaction technique that was developed using two Nintendo Wii Remotes to track the movement of infrared lights attached to the user's fingers. Further tracking in three dimensions was achieved using predictive interpolation. A framework was designed and implemented to enable the recognition of predefined gestures using Finite State Automata and Discrete Hidden Markov Models. This paper also presents the results of a user study that was undertaken in order to investigate the usefulness of the Wii3D System and the general intuitiveness of the proposed interface and gestures. The user study asked participants to compare the interaction possible using the Wii3D system with interaction using a standard mouse and keyboard. Participants found the Wii3D System was more intuitive for multi-touch applications, but was not as intuitive as the mouse and keyboard for single pointer applications, even though the proposed interaction technique was found adequate for the majority of the gestures implemented.},

abstract = {Classification modeling is commonly used for predictive data mining to create models (classifiers) that can predict the values of qualitative variables. Ensemble classification is concerned with the creation of many base classifiers which are then combined into one predictive classification model. Positive-versus-negative (pVn) classification has recently been proposed in the literature as an ensemble classification method with a potential to provide high predictive performance. Many methods of combining base model predictions for ensembles have been reported in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to report on a study that was conducted to compare four methods of combining base model predictions for pVn ensemble classification. The four methods that were studied are the max rule, min rule, sum rule and product rule. The four rules were studied for classification tree and artificial neural network pVn ensemble classification using a benchmark dataset for computer network intrusion detection systems. The main conclusion from the studies is that the sum, product and min rules provide predictive performance which is at least as high as that provided by the max rule for pVn classification.},

The motivation for the model is the growth of mobile devices with varying degrees of sensor capability and varying levels of processing power. For smart phones with various sensors, a sophisticated operating system is warranted by the complexity of the resources being managed. At the same time, existing operating systems tend to be strong either in real-time support, or in conventional application support, not both. This paper proposes a preliminary design for a contactile system, based on insights from microkernel systems like L4ka and Minix 3, which have illustrated how designs with dissimilar layers may be pieced together.},

Problem frames identify specific combinations, and interactions, of problems, real-world domains, and requirements. Domain-Specific Languages (DSL's) are exemplary in their ability to provide solutions to specific problem domains. This paper explores the relationship between problem frames, that describe the types of problems that a software system is attempting to address, and DSL decision patterns that detail when a DSL might prove useful. Thirty-five DSL case studies are used in mapping the decision patterns to their corresponding problem frames. It is shown that all of the decision patterns map to transformation or workpieces problems. This mapping serves as a guide linking a given problem to appropriate decision patterns, and ultimately to DSL employment.},

We present a case study of our use of the process on an ICT4D project, during which time we observed the combined benefits of using personas and of working with a non-governmental organisation (NGO) intermediary materialise. We attribute these outcomes to our persona creation workshops. Information which the NGO furnished regarding sensitive personal circumstances typical of our end users greatly improved our understanding of our users. This information would likely not have come to light had we interviewed the users ourselves, which we believe demonstrates the validity of relying on intermediary information for persona creation rather than first-hand information.},

The diffusion of mobile phones in sub-Saharan Africa has increased dramatically in recent years. This growth in mobile phone usage cannot be ignored and to progress without utilizing it in developmental strategies. This article reviews the impact and capability of mobile phones as catalysts for digital inclusion and socio-economic development. The cumulative and recursive framework of successive kinds of access to digital technologies is employed to explain the diffusion of mobile phones in East Africa. The analysis shows that the use of mobile phones has been bridging the digital divide in the region thereby promoting trade, regional cooperation and development.},

As a consequence, the evolvement of modern approaches that purport to simplify the engineering of such services is a necessity. In this short paper, we present a work-in-progress model-driven approach that seeks to simplify and speed up the process of engineering RESTful semantic services. The suggested approach promotes automatic transformation of platform independent service models to partial service implementation and semantic descriptions to realize functional RESTful semantic services. The proposed solution is demonstrated and evaluated through a simple use-case scenario.},

While technology accounts for increased energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, toxic landfill pollution and loss of biodiversity, this exploratory research suggests that corporates in South Africa are slow to engage with environmental sustainability as a strategic issue. A contribution to knowledge is provided in the research indicating that one of the drivers of adoption in South Africa appears to be cost saving (rather than for ethical or regulatory reasons). Data was collected from corporation representatives responsible for Green Information Technology implementation. Butler's Integrative Model of Institutional Theory of Green Information Systems was used as a theoretical framework and the influences of adoption were tested deductively against the research data. The paper concludes by expanding on the Integrative Model to incorporate an additional driver (Cost-saving) and makes recommendations for further research.},
