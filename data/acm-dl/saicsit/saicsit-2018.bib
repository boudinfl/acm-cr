abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) present a number of vulnerabilities, threats and risks that could lead to devastating cyber-attacks resulting into huge financial losses, legal implications, and reputational damage for large and small organizations. As such, in this digital transformation and 4th industrial revolution era, nations and organizations have accepted that cybersecurity must be part of their strategic objectives and priorities. However, cybersecurity in itself is a multifaceted problem to address and the voluntary "one-size-fits-all" cybersecurity approaches have proven not effective in dealing with cyber incidents, especially in complex operational environments (e.g. large technology-centric organizations) that are multi-disciplinary, multi-departmental, multi-role, multinational, and operating across different locations. Addressing modern cybersecurity challenges requires more than a technical solution. A contextual and systematic approach that considers the complexities of these large digital environments in order to achieve resilient, sustainable, cost-effective and proactive cybersecurity is desirable. This paper aims to highlight through a single case study approach the multifaceted nature and complexity of the cybersecurity environment, pertinently in multi-disciplinary organizations. Essentially, this paper contributes a unified cybersecurity framework underpinned by an integrated capability management (ICM) approach that addresses the multifaceted nature of cybersecurity as well as the challenges and requirements eminent in complex environments, such as national government, municipalities or large corporations. The unified framework incorporates realistic and practical guidelines to bridge the gap between cybersecurity capability requirements, governance instruments and cybersecurity capability specification, implementation, employment and sustainment drawing from well-tested military capability development approaches.},

abstract = {Self-sovereign identity promises prospective users greater control, security, privacy, portability and overall greater convenience; however the immaturity of current distributed key management solutions results in general disregard of security advisories in favour of convenience and accessibility. This research proposes the use of intermediate certificates as a distributed key management solution. Intermediate certificates will be shown to allow multiple keys to authenticate to a single self-sovereign identity. Keys may be freely added to an identity without requiring a distributed ledger, any other third-party service or sharing private keys between devices. This research will also show that key rotation is a superior alternative to existing key recovery and escrow systems in helping users recover when their keys are lost or compromised. These features will allow remote credentials to be used to issuer, present and appraise remote attestations, without relying on a constant Internet connection.},

abstract = {Crowdsensing empowers citizens to collect and share sensed data from their surrounding environments using their mobile devices as sophisticated sensors. However, whilst many studies have done research on crowdsensing, very few researchers have investigated the potential participation profile of citizens. Understanding these profiles can assist with designing crowdsensing systems with appropriate incentive mechanisms to achieve adequate user participation and good service quality. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the participation profiles (intentions and motivations) of citizens who potentially could participate in crowdsensing projects for water resource monitoring (WRM). The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used to investigate citizens' intentions to participate and to determine the influence of their attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control on these intentions. An extended framework of motivational and demotivational factors for crowdsensing was used to determine citizens' motivations. The findings show TPB can be effective for predicting behavioural intentions, and that there is potential for citizens to submit data for WRM. The results of this study provide a fundamental basis that can assist researchers and practitioners to gain an understanding of citizens' perceptions of WRM. Recommendations for project coordination and data collection protocols are made that can be used to improve the success of crowdsensing for WRM.},

abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) for underresourced languages may benefit from a bootstrapping approach to utilise the sparse resources across closely related languages. This brings afore the question of language similarity, and therewith the question of how to measure that, so as to make informed predictions on potential success of bootstrapping. We present a method for measuring morphosyntactic similarity by developing Context Free Grammars (CFGs) for isiXhosa and isiZulu verb fragments that are relevant for the use case of weather forecast generation. We then investigate morphosyntactic similarity of the CFGs using parse tree analysis and four binary similarity measures. In particular, we selected four binary similarity measures from other domains and adapted them to our data, which are the word sets generated from the respective CFGs. The similarity measures together with the parse tree analysis are used to study the the extent to which both languages can be generated by a singular grammar fragment. The resulting 52 rules for isiXhosa and 49 rules for isiZulu overlap on 42 rules. This supports the existing intuition of similarity, as they are in the same language cluster. The morphosyntactic similarity measured with the binary coefficients reached 59.5% overall (adapted Driver-Kroeber), with 99.5% for the past tense only. This lower score cf. the structure of the CFG is attributable to the small differences in terminals in mainly the prefix of the verb. The parse tree analysis and binary similarity measures show that a modularised set of rules for the prefix, verb root, and suffix would allow the generation of the two languages with a single grammar where only the prefix requires differentiation.},

Dropout is a popular deep learning technique which has shown to improve the performance of large neural networks. Recurrent neural networks are powerful networks specialised at solving problems which use time series data. Three different approaches to incorporating Dropout with recurrent neural networks have been suggested. However, these approaches have not been evaluated under identical experimental conditions. This article investigates the performance of these Dropout approaches using a 2D physics simulation benchmark. After applying statistical tests it was found that using Dropout did improve network performance on the benchmark. However, contrary to the literature, the Dropout approach which was expected to perform poorly, performed well, and the approach which was expected to perform well, performed poorly.},

Cane quality tends to deteriorate after burning, so it must be delivered as soon as possible to the mill for processing. This situation is dynamic and many factors, including weather conditions, delivery quotas and previous decisions taken, affect when and how much cane to burn. A dynamic Bayesian decision network (DBDN) was developed, using an iterative knowledge engineering approach, to represent sugarcane growers' adaptive pre-harvest burning decisions. It was evaluated against five different scenarios which were crafted to represent the range of issues the grower faces when making these decisions. The DBDN was able to adapt reactively to delays in deliveries, although the model did not have enough states representing delayed delivery statuses. The model adapted proactively to rain forecasts, but only adapted reactively to high wind forecasts. The DBDN is a promising way of modelling such dynamic, adaptive operational decisions.},

It is also clear that IT is contributing to this degradation and depletion, which requires that Green IT practices be an imperative. Since Green IT practices are often not common sense, it is vital that these Green IT practices are taught to others, and teachers typically have the skills and opportunities to teach many people. This demonstrates the relevance and significance of the study. The research problem is the lack of research addressing the theoretical antecedents to teaching Green IT, which are considered vital for understanding how to improve student teachers' intention to teach Green IT and their resultant teaching of Green IT. The study addressed this research problem by surveying student teachers using a quantitative questionnaire at three teacher training institutions in Swaziland, Africa. The resultant data was analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) based on an a priori set of antecedents and their hypothesized relationships from the literature. The findings indicate that the most beneficial allocation of time and resources would be to enhance the student teachers' level of awareness, perceived behavioural control and person-related beliefs to positively influence their intention to teach Green IT, and consequently, their actual behaviour of teaching Green IT.},

Despite the subgraph isomorphism problem being NP-hard, research has been dedicated to proposing new algorithms which are designed to improve the shortcomings of the algorithms that have been previously proposed. However, some of the newly invented solutions do not improve on their predecessors and some are redundant because their algorithmic properties are not different from some existing algorithms. The problem arises because minimal effort has been made towards organising subgraph isomorphism algorithms in terms of their relationships and differences such that new solutions utilise knowledge extracted from the organisation of knowledge about these algorithms. The need to organise information has motivated the current study to show how Formal Concept Analysis can be used to build a conceptlattice based taxonomy of algorithms. There are many subgraph isomorphism algorithms and it is not feasible to list all of them. As a result, the implications between the attributes of the algorithms are used to build a representative taxonomy of the domain of subgraph isomorphism algorithms. The paper focuses on how the tools from Formal Concept Analysis can be used to build a taxonomy. This is illustrated using a small sample subset of algorithms.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a foremost and influential technology driver of business initiatives in recent times. Although, security is the most discussed concern on cloud platforms, other dependability attributes such as reliability, availability, robustness and the likes are also important for successful cloud implementations. So far, existing approaches of dependability requirements elicitation have focused on eliciting individual dependability attributes separately even though dependability attributes are known to be interrelated and interdependent in terms of their potential impact on developed systems. Thus, it is difficult to gain a prompt and holistic understanding of the dependability constraints that a system must satisfy, which has limited the efficiency and effectiveness of the dependability requirements engineering (DRE) process. There is a dearth of approaches that can support an integrated view of a system's dependability attributes under a single requirements elicitation framework. In this paper, we propose new visual notational extensions to the existing misuse case (MUC) model in order to compose an integrated framework that can support the elicitation of various cloud dependability requirements. To do this, we conducted an analytical evaluation of some proposed notational extensions based on the nine principles of constructing visual notations in software engineering as proposed by Moody. Also, by using a case study from the mobile banking domain, a trial experiment was undertaken to assess the capability of the extended MUC framework to support the elicitation of multiple cloud dependability requirements. The result of the pilot experiment shows that the extended misuse case driven technique is credible and viable for the elicitation of cloud dependability requirements.},

The contribution of this paper is to contextualize new smart city solutions for integrated city planning and management within the framework of South African policy tools, with the aim of identifying synergies and gaps for future research. This is achieved by carrying out a literature review of existing and emerging tools for integrated decision-making in South African cities and performing a subsequent gap analysis.},

abstract = {Enterprise architecture (EA)1 is a highly specialized and skilled discipline. Within the organizational context, EA is implemented and applied at strategic, tactical and operational levels. The main role of EA is the alignment of IT and the business to ensure that the business is supported and enabled by IT. Considering the relative newness of enterprise architect role and the specialised nature of the discipline, it is imperative to understand the skills and competencies that enterprise architects should have in order to effectively and efficiently perform their role. The objective of this research study was to understand the competencies and skills of enterprise architects. Using a qualitative research approach, interviews were conducted in a mobile telecommunication firm in South Africa. The findings revealed that the enterprise architect must possess human, business and technical skills to adequately execute their role in the organisation. Essentially, human skills are needed to co-exist and collaborate with other people in the organisation and comprise interpersonal and personal skills needed to operate in this role. The business skills showed that the enterprise architect needs to be a multi-skilled business leader who charts the future of the enterprise and has business domain knowledge. Lastly, technical skills require a talented individual with the ability to solve technical IT problems and apply technical expertise in the business domain. The research contributes to the body of knowledge on EA, specifically on the competencies and skills of enterprise architects.},

Timely detection and mitigation is a key concern for the SANReN Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). This paper presents an analysis on the Memcached reflection DDoS attack which occurred in February 2018. The attack was the largest DDoS attack to date. By analysing the attack and the impact it had on the SANReN network, this paper aims to show how network flow data can be used to detect network attacks, and perform post attack analysis to prevent future network attacks. The attack time-line is divided into three main phases: pre-attack, peek attack period and post attack residue.},

abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have the * potential to empower people living in disadvantaged communities. ICTs are regarded as a powerful agent for a variety forms of empowerment. ICTs are, thus, potent development enablers for the advancement of their development process and for providing individuals with tools for self-empowerment and circumvention of inequalities. This paper reports on a study of the impact of ICTs on empowering people living in disadvantaged communities in Cape Town. The study used qualitative methods and data were gathered by observations, in-depth interviews, and field notes. The study used Choice Framework as a theoretical lens. The findings of the study confirm that ICTs may have positive empowerment outcomes with choice itself being the primary outcome. Individuals' freedoms and capabilities are enhanced and are able to achieve the life they desire. However, ICTs on their own do not provide empowerment; they have to be contextualized. Further, a number of challenges still deter the uptake and impact of ICTs. These include lack of awareness of existing ICTs and their benefits, technological and general illiteracy or lack of adequate skills to exploit ICTs, language limitations, plus discourses and affordability. Consequently, human capacity for ICT consumption has to be enhanced to secure empowerment through ICTs.},

abstract = {WeThinkCode_ is a tuition-free coding academy in Johannesburg that uses peer-to-peer learning methods. Launched in 2015, it positioned itself as a tertiary learning environment for anyone aged 17-35 looking to acquire digital skills. In South Africa, socio-economic circumstances for the majority of the population mean that their access to fees-based graduate training opportunities is limited. This is despite a significant undersupply of skilled software developers and many companies citing a lack of such skills as a strategic challenge. This mixed methods case study uses elementary statistical methods and thematic analysis to review elements of WeThinkCode_. Three transitions in the student journey are used as a high level framework to elicit insights about how the school works; (1) Applicant to Participant, (2) Participant to Learner and (3) Learner to Contributor.Applicant to Participant: The school attracts large numbers of economically disadvantaged individuals, filters them for programming affinity and inducts a manageable sized cohort into campus life. Participant to Learner: There is a well structured and continuously improving framework including life skills as well as core and elective modules over two years which facilitates the individual and collective learning process with strict performance measures. Learner to Contributor: Four month internship programmes in each year of study help students prepare for the workplace and build relationships with the corporates who sponsored their studies. The 2016 cohort has progressed through this student journey at WeThinkCode_ to become the first batch of workplace-ready programmers. Further work is also proposed including a socio-economic study of the contribution of the 2016 cohort and a comparison with relevant traditional tertiary education institutions covering costs, sustainability and student performance.},

Academic activities, such as accessing study material or contacting lecturers and other teaching and learning processes, are difficult to perform at an open distance learning institution without the use of computers and the Internet. This article investigates and reports on usability principles not satisfied based on time taken by students with disabilities to complete certain tasks, using the University of South Africa (Unisa) website and myUnisa, its e-learning website. The findings of the study indicate that not all usability principles for participants or students with disabilities are satisfied by this institution's e-learning websites. The study con-firms that well-developed e-learning platforms must guarantee efficient, effective and satisfactory use by all students, including those with disabilities. The study suggests that it is important for all the relevant stakeholders to be involved in the development of websites to ensure that accessibility and usability are properly adhered to. The aim is to reduce digital and social divides and the marginalisation of students, specifically when the target user groups have disabilities or limited capabilities.},

abstract = {Gesture recognition is a convenient and natural Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technique. Recent advances in bioengineering have seen the use of biosensor technologies in HCI, since various biosensors provide real-time feedback from biological activities. This has enabled User Interface (UI) designers to design more natural UIs, including the use of a Muscle-Computer Interface (MCI). This paper presents an evaluation of an MCI designed to recognize four-finger pinching, fist action and five-hand-fingers spread gestures using Electromyography (EMG) signals from a Myo armband from Thalmic Labs Inc.™. An experimental research strategy was used and a Feedforward Neural Network was implemented to classify the gestures and each of the gestures was trained for 3 seconds.An average 95% success rate for completing gesture-posing tasks among 6 participants was achieved with an average predicting error value of 14.48, expressed by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results illustrate the application of biosensors in gesture recognition as a modern and reliable approach which benefits the HCI. Biosensor-based gesture recognition provided a greater level of accessibility and encumbered the users less when this approach was compared with vision- and sensor-based approaches. The Myo armband showed that it is an economical and standard bio-sensing wearable device that can be successfully used in hand-finger gesture recognition.},

Although personalized information retrieval systems take care of user's topics of interest, but they do not consider if the topics are time periodic. The same ranked list cannot satisfy user search intents every time. This paper proposes a solution to rerank the search results for time sensitive ambiguous queries. An algorithm "HighTime" is presented here to disambiguate the time sensitive ambiguous queries and re-rank the default Google results by using a time sensitive user profile. The algorithm is evaluated by using two comparative measures, MAP and NDCG.Results from user experiments showed that re-ranking of search results based on HighTime is effective in presenting relevant results to the users.},

abstract = {Organisations that manage information systems development projects need to be able to quickly adapt and adjust project requirements. Agile systems development methodologies (SDM) are a family of systems development methodologies that allow organisations to adapt to changing requirements. They have been linked to decreased development time and higher employee and customer satisfaction. However, there have been challenges with the adoption and acceptance of agile SDM in well-established organisations. Traditional decision-making process often conflict with the principles and management practices needed to support agile SDM.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the usage and acceptance of agile methodologies by individuals working within organisations in South Africa. To achieve this, a cross sectional survey was conducted at two large firms in the banking and financial industry. The study was underpinned by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).A sample of 143 observations was collected. The data was tested using the Partial Least Squares path modelling techniques. The findings show that Facilitating Conditions and Behavioural Intention are predictors of agile SDM Usage in the banking sector. Performance Expectancy, Social Influence and Effort Expectancy were not found to have significant effects on Behavioural Intention. Therefore, organisations seeking to use agile SDM need to ensure that they provide support structures and facilitating conditions for their employees.},

Methods to ensure data privacy protection based on both system and organisational reference architectures are therefore required. Based on an analysis of existing reference architectures for IoT and CPS, this paper proposes a consolidated architecture relevant for ensuring data privacy for both IoT and CPS. The proposed architecture is then combined with an enterprise architecture reference framework to propose a data privacy model for IoT and CPS with a focus on both organisational and technological features and positioned to guide compliance with the South African Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPI Act).1},

abstract = {As multicore CPUs become more common, scalable synchronization primitives have wider use and ideas previously used in large-scale computation are worth re-opening for wider use. In this paper I explore one approach to scalable synchronization, a minimal-contention lock (M-lock). The key idea is to avoid spinning on a global variable but instead for each blocked task (process or thread) to spin on a local lock representing the task that immediately preceded it in attempting to acquire the lock. This creates an ordering based on the order in which tasks attempt to acquire the lock, preventing starvation. The only globally shared variable is a pointer to the next local lock to be contended for. Each contending task swaps the value of this pointer for a pointer to its own variable. It spins on the variable previously pointed to by the global pointer. Each waiting task spins on a lock only seen by itself and the owner of that lock variable. While a task is spinning, the lock variable can be held in its local cache until invalidated by the lock owner when it unsets the lock. Consequently, the amount of bus traffic is considerably less than with a spinlock, which has the pernicious feature that the task releasing the lock is delayed by all the other bus traffic arising from contention for the lock. An MCS lock has similar properties but is more complicated and requires more memory contention-causing operations. This paper outlines the design of the M-lock and provides a preliminary performance analysis.},

Resolving the issues of siloes between the development and operations departments in order to allow collaboration between them is the underlying philosophy of the DevOps movement. However, existing evidence indicates that the challenges surrounding the adoption of this collaboration culture by management and organisations may not necessarily translate to acceptance at implantation level by the teams. There is therefore a need for a model to guide the adoption.This study investigated human behavioural models and technology acceptance models that predict the behavioural intent to accept new technology. Based on the identified acceptance predictors, a model for successful acceptance of DevOps collaboration culture was proposed. This proposed model would be useful to software development organisations who have already adopted or are about to adopt DevOps.},

An increase in HLT R&amp;D in South Africa since then, as well as developments in language resource management in the country surfaced the need for an updated audit of HLT resources. Consolidating information on the availability and maturity of HLT resources provides valuable information for both researchers and decision-makers. On the one hand, information on available HLT resources enables researchers to identify new opportunities for multidisciplinary research. On the other, decision-makers can use the information to determine priorities for resource development and where to focus their investments. The paper presents an overview of the main findings of an audit of HLT resources, undertaken in 2017/8, and makes some suggestions for ensuring that the current information is continually updated as new resources are developed.},

abstract = {High reliability organizations (HROs) are those organizations that focus on prevention, not reaction, and that require information systems to operate in nearly error-free conditions. As the consequences of system failure in an HRO are disastrous, system errors are not an option. Systems in an HRO should be examined continuously and pro-actively, and each employee must ensure that their particular operational aspects exclude the potential of disaster. As such, employees are stakeholders in system requirement elicitation which is one of the mechanisms through which operational aspects may be managed. However, traditional system requirements elicitation processes, do not include knowledge capturing as an outcome of the requirements elicitation process. In order to address knowledge capturing during system requirement elicitation, this paper proposes a model for knowledge capturing during system requirements elicitation in an HRO. The model was developed through a single case study conducted at an air navigation service provider organization in South Africa. By considering the ways in which system requirements are elicited and knowledge captured, benefit may be realized across maintaining a zero-failure environment in an HRO.},

abstract = {It is known [4] that both satisfiability and model-checking problems for propositional Linear-time Temporal Logic, LTL, with only a single propositional variable in the language are PSPACE-complete, which coincides with the complexity of these problems for LTL with an arbitrary number of propositional variables [14]. In the present paper, we show that the same result can be obtained by modifying the original proof of PSPACE-hardness for LTL from [14]; i.e., we show how to modify the construction from [14] to model the computations of polynomially-space bound Turing machines using only formulas of one variable. We believe that our alternative proof of the results from [4] gives additional insight into the semantic and computational properties of LTL.},
