abstract = {This paper seeks to contribute to the field of learning management system (LMS) development in tertiary education institutions, in particular, to advance the adoption of LMSes by exploring the incorporation of appropriate socially-motivated discussion forums. This study uses a Web-based application, which implements four different discussion forum models for learning management systems (LMSes), in order to test usability and student preferences. Two non-social discussion forums and two social discussion forums were compared, to determine their appropriateness in terms of attributes or features and general functionality for LMSes. The design processes led to the creation of a Web-based application called 4DFs that includes implementations of all discussion forum models. Two of these models are non-social discussion forums: the chat room unstructured model and the traditional general threaded discussion. The other two types are social discussion forums, where users can choose who they converse with: the Twitter-style short comment feed and the Facebook-style hybrid post and reply. A controlled experiment was conducted with 31 students from the institution. The study found that students preferred that the learning forum includes certain characteristics - they prioritised ease of use, low complexity, less interaction and a user-friendly interface over their familiarity with the forum. For learning, there is a need to use the features for a specific purpose so users do not necessarily want non-essential features like emojis; instead they want systems that help them to learn efficiently.},

abstract = {This study analyses how teacher educators integrate technology into curriculum delivery and hence propose ways of assisting them to use the technologies into their teaching in a constructive manner. The conceptual model to understand the teacher educators’ technology integration was developed by combining constructivist teaching theory with Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) complimented with Substitution Augmentation Modification Redefinition (SAMR) – both technology integration frameworks and the theory of constructivism. The researchers employed a qualitative research approach, gathered data using one-on-one semi-structured interviews and non-participant lecture observations. Eight teacher educators participated in the study. Analysis of the data collected shows that teacher educators in the study were limited in their knowledge of integrating technology into curriculum delivery in a way that enhanced teaching learning outcomes. The teacher educators need to be assisted on how to integrate the technologies following a constructivist approach to teach effectively in the 21st century.},

abstract = { In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students’ risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students’ risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student’s risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions. This work will benefit academic developers and staff who provide support to students who are at academic risk of completing their undergraduate Science programmes.},

abstract = { For radio telescopes, radio frequency interference from terrestrial and other sources is a recognized problem that contaminates the signal (RFI) and must be tracked and ultimately removed. At the MeerKAT/SKA telescope, RFI is recorded with a variety of devices, including telescopes, sensors, and scanners; but the combination of data from these multiple sources to yield a unified view of RFI remains a challenging problem. Previously, we demonstrated that a scalable database model with an implementation based on the Polystore framework is a potential solution for RFI monitoring. Here we extend this work, implementing the database model in an integrated environment and evaluating its performance across a range of workloads with three data stores: SciDB, PSQL, and Accumulo. We find that SciDB and Accumulo scale better than PSQL under multi-user environments. Results show a minimal latency as low as 0.02 seconds, irrespective of the location, and data store type. Further, integrated APIs provide single notation and are 5% faster than third-party APIs. Our findings thus provide a guide to the proposed integrated RFI system at MeerKAT/SKA radio telescope.},

abstract = { Ethereum smart contract exploits have inflicted enormous monetary damage due to vulnerabilities introduced accidentally by the contract authors. Many of these errors can now be detected automatically by a growing number of security analysis tools that specifically target the most common vulnerabilities present in the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem. The aim of this work is to identify state-of-the-art security analysis tools that assist auditors in automatically testing and verifying real-world contracts. We compare two such symbolic executioners, Manticore (which we also extend) and Mythril, and one fuzz tester, Echidna, to evaluate their effectiveness when analysing a set of challenge contracts hosted online, as well as twenty of the most popular ERC-20 tokens found on the main Ethereum network. Our results showed that the tools were able to solve 24 of the 39 challenge contracts and both symbolic tools achieved on average more than 80% code coverage on successful evaluations of the popular ERC-20 token data. Code coverage plateaued after the second symbolic transaction, suggesting a good performance target for continuous integration environments.},

abstract = { This paper provides a review of past approaches to the use of deep-learning frameworks for the analysis of discrete irregular-patterned complex sequential datasets. A typical example of such a dataset is financial data where specific events trigger sudden irregular changes in the sequence of the data. Traditional deep-learning methods perform poorly or even fail when trying to analyse these datasets. The results of a systematic literature review reveal the dominance of frameworks based on recurrent neural networks. The performance of deep-learning frameworks was found to be evaluated mainly using mean absolute error and root mean square error accuracy metrics. Underlying challenges that were identified are: lack of performance robustness, non-transparency of the methodology, internal and external architectural design and configuration issues. These challenges provide an opportunity to improve the framework for complex irregular-patterned sequential datasets. },

Both 2D and 3D minutiae are cast as point clouds that we augment with additional features. Iterative Closest Points (ICP) is immediately applicable to these data structures, yet nonetheless relatively unexplored in the fingerprinting domain. We apply our ICP-based method to conventional 2D minutiae and 3D features extracted from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans of fingertips. We show that ICP is a viable strategy to fingerprint matching using the diverse features in the internal fingerprint skin. Using 3D minutiae alone gave an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.961, and 3D minutiae augmented with mean local OCT intensity gave an AUC of 0.973. Regarding 2D minutiae, our method offers a significant improvement over the baseline NIST Bozorth3 algorithm: an AUC of 0.94 versus 0.86 on an artificial dataset generated with SFinGe. In addition, ICP incurs only nominal computation cost when additional features are added.},

abstract = { Traditional cluster analysis metrics rank clustering structures in terms of compactness and distinctness of clusters. However, in real world applications this is usually insufficient for selecting the optimal clustering structure. Domain experts and visual analysis are often relied on during evaluation, which results in a selection process that tends to be adhoc, subjective and difficult to reproduce. This work proposes the use of competency questions and a cluster scoring matrix to formalise expert knowledge and application requirements for qualitative evaluation of clustering structures. We show how a qualitative ranking of clustering structures can be integrated with traditional metrics to guide cluster evaluation and selection for generating representative energy consumption profiles that characterise residential electricity demand in South Africa. The approach is shown to be highly effective for identifying usable and expressive consumption profiles within this specific application context, and certainly has wider potential for efficient, transparent and repeatable cluster selection in real-world applications.},

abstract = {With Baby Boomers comprising a significant and profitable segment of the South African population, understanding the banking behaviour of seniors becomes an important task for banking institutions. With minimal literature dedicated to the banking behaviour of seniors, this study aimed to outline aspects which influenced Boomer's intention to use branch or digital channels and identify reasons for this. Literature highlighted the significant role of behavioural beliefs, trust, normative beliefs, perceived usefulness, perceived secureness and perceived control in banking intention, with gender, computer literacy, banking institution and banking channel used, being the major differences when choosing to walk into a branch or bank electronically. By applying the Kruskal-Wallis test on data collected from 281 Boomers across Gauteng, it was found that the gender of Boomers did not have any differences across branch and digital channels. By applying banking channel split, differences were found among the branch, digital and both channel groups for all six variables for both branch and DB intention. Reasons for these differences were also outlined within. Based on these findings, recommendations for the banking institutions of SA have been provided. Suggestions on future research initiatives are included, with linking banking intention to banking behaviour and conducting comparisons to other generational groups being notable topics.},

The aim of the pilot project was to develop digital innovations that recognise agency in communities through lived experiences and local knowledge. An urban planning perspective was introduced to contextualise socio-environmental challenges to ground social innovations in reality and encourage a sustainable uptake of digital innovations by communities. The IS student projects emphasised empathy, storytelling and prototyping as part of a design thinking process which both incorporated and influenced the conceptual model presented in this paper. This conceptual model informed by four design principles of - relationality, reflexivity, responsiveness and recognition - is offered as an enrichment for a learning environment. It foregrounds the development of competencies for collaborative problem solving and ultimately transdisciplinary knowledge creation.},

Telework is a well-researched topic which dates as far back as five decades ago. While telework provides many indisputable benefits to organisations, society and individuals, it has not achieved the anticipated widespread adoption. While telework studies have examined multiple aspects, few studies have examined organisational factors which affect telework adoption. This study is an empirical investigation of telework adoption, using a set of factors identified in the literature in organisations in a South African context. These factors in prior studies were found to enable or prevent an organisation from adopting telework. The question thus asked in this study was “Which factors enable or prevent the adoption of telework within South African organisations?” A survey with 104 valid responses was analysed using Statistica. The theoretical contribution of the study is a validated model of factors influencing the adoption of telework.},

abstract = {The current corporate landscape induces numerous novel challenges regarding sustained productivity, creating a committed workforce, and addressing the increasing level of daily user dependence on technology. As employee dependence on technology increases, it becomes vital to not only understand the concept of employee commitment but also the impact and influence that technology has on such commitment. Mobile knowledge workers are highly dependent on technology to complete their tasks. The mobile landscape poses various challenges to a mobile knowledge worker, amongst others, connectivity issues; alienation and isolation from their colleagues; reduced opportunities for relationship building; and a degraded corporate identity. Whilst implementing technology with the aim of addressing the various challenges brought about by the mobile-work landscape is a noble goal, it is important that the technology earmarked for introduction to the workers are appropriate for the end-users of the technology and the tasks the workers need to complete. In this paper we investigate how the task-technology fit model relates to organisational commitment and to what extent it may address the challenges of mobile knowledge workers in South Africa.},

abstract = {TANKS is a tangible coding game that introduces coding to South African learners of ages 10-14yrs. It is aimed to initiate and stimulate learning using facilitators. Facilitators use untraditional teaching methods because they are highly influential on the potential success of the training. Also, facilitators undertook face-to-face contact sessions since TANKS require the use of a smart phone and tokens. Applying the feed-forward learning flow model, a supportive school leadership by principal or teachers creates an academic coding culture, which then will necessitate learners’ competitive behaviour through the adoption of a performance-based appraisal practice, measured by each game level completed, in order to improve coding interest and TANKS performance by learners. A phenomenological qualitative study design approach of 6 facilitators of face-to-face interview using an adapted semi-structured questionnaire was used. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis using an explanation building strategy was applied in this study. Results identified some themes such as: “understanding of tangible game”, “facilitator's lived experience”, “roles of a facilitator”, “learner experience”, “qualities of a facilitator”, “facilitator-learner communication”, “team vs individual work” and “facilitator's challenges”. Each theme is further explained in the study. Limitations included small interviewee numbers as the threat of a nationwide pandemic loomed. By applying the feed-forward learning flow model, we conclude that a supportive school leadership by principal or teachers creates an academic coding culture, which then will necessitate learners’ competitive behaviour through the adoption of a performance-based appraisal practice, in order to improve coding interest and TANKS performance by learners.},

abstract = {Despite advancements in machine translation systems and the development of language-independent frameworks for machine translation, support for African languages is relatively low, while the majority of the supported few are yet to achieve acceptable translation accuracies. Lack of language resources and pre-processing tools have been identified as the major factors limiting the inclusion of most African languages in current translation engines. Yor\`{u}b\'{a}, a Niger-Congo language largely spoken in the South-Western part of Nigeria with an estimated speaker of about 50 million people, is one of the languages currently supported by machine translation engines such as Google Translate. Unfortunately, translation accuracy involving Yor\`{u}b\'{a} language is relatively low in comparison with most European languages. One of the reasons for this is the lack of pre-processing tools such as the Elision resolution tool. Elision in Yor\`{u}b\'{a} is the omission of tone or syllable from a text, often as a result of speech smoothening between adjacent words. This paper presents an Elision resolution framework for the Yor\`{u}b\'{a} language. The proposed framework uses a hybrid approach to elision resolution. It applies a rule-based word-partitioning algorithm at the syllabication phase, while it uses the n-gram language model for resolution-candidate ranking.

abstract = { Diabetes retinopathy (DR) is a disease that afflicts diabetic patients and is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina of the eye. This disease is a leading cause of blindness and is a common complication of diabetes. Regular screening and early detection are crucial to treatment. Automated classification with machine learning techniques has shown promise in this regard. Previous work has not addressed the imbalances in the datasets used. In this paper, we report on the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques for balancing the datasets and thus improving the accuracy of automated diagnosis of DR from fundus images. We achieve state of the art results – an F1 score of 0.8 and an accuracy of 86.96% by using data augmentation to balance the dataset.},

The intent being to improve on existing algorithms, specifically using the existing MeloSee algorithm as a baseline prototype (). This paper presents two new visual-to-auditory sensory substitution prototypes ( and ), which investigate different techniques for gaining depth perception. The primary manner in which the prototypes achieve this is through sound localisation techniques. Comparative studies were conducted against the researcher's implementation of the MeloSee algorithm. For the first study, and were compared. For the second study, and were compared. Each study had 8 unique participants, for a total of 16 participants across the two studies. It was found that the use of the various techniques had a measurable effect on improving the performance of visual-to-auditory sensory substitution for depth perception in certain scenarios. Specifically, performance was improved when identifying the quadrant in which an object was in, and when navigating a narrow corridor.},

This paper presents a novel ES method called, Bootstrapped Neuro-Evolution (BNE), for the evolution of policies for POMDP problems. This method trains a simulator and evolves a population of policies in a concurrent process that was adapted from the Evolutionary Robotics’ algorithm, the Bootstrapped Neuro-Simulator. The findings of this study indicate that BNE can be used to successfully evolve closed-loop control policies and train simulators that can be used to evaluate a partial fitness function of a policy for POMDP. This partial fitness function aids in the evolutionary process without inherently increasing the sample complexity of the algorithm. },

In conceptualizing and instantiating the research artifact, the DSR method was operationalized through the Mullarkey and Hevner elaborated Action Design Research (ADR) process model. The ADR process model was considered an appropriate choice as it caters for an immersive exploration as part of an in-situ context. This study articulated in this paper is considered to have a problem-centered entry point, as it is driven by the researcher-practitioner's desire to understand what a “better artefact would look like”. The ADR process model is adopted, since it's iterative and in-situ nature is in line with the overreaching organizational research aim to develop a process model that can describe and guide the process of testing conformance of health information systems to the eHealth interoperability standards prescribed by the Health Normative Standards Framework in South Africa.},

This paper explores how trust shapes the continuum of use of maternal mHealth, thus determining their adoption and continued use. The study employed the Expectation Disconfirmation Theory and a case study approach. We collected data using interviews, focus group discussions and observations from 32 purposively sampled participants. Our results suggest that the risks and uncertainties of the maternal healthcare-seeking context play a critical role in how trust shapes mHealth continuum of use. Our findings underscore the need to mHealth designers and implementers to consider different factors that will facilitate the development of trust at the different phases of the continuum to ensure continued use.},

abstract = {South Africa (S.A.) is currently facing economic and social challenges that could benefit from the implementation of international smart city guidelines. Crucial to transforming a city into a smart city is the collection and access to reliable data. One of the main problems experienced by S.A. cities is the limited access to data, resulting from a traditionally fragmented approach to data collection, sharing and use. Crime-related data is one of the most commonly collected datasets in smart cities. In S.A., crime data is predominantly collected by the S.A. Police Services (SAPS) and security companies. While the latter are not readily available for public use, SAPS crime data is consolidated and disseminated at the national level. Initial data exploration, however, shows that temporal, spatial and structural inconsistencies in the data limits the usefulness of available crime data. In this study, the inconsistencies in SAPS crime data are summarised, and standard data wrangling techniques are implemented and evaluated to clean the data. The study proposes a data wrangling model for S.A. crime data. Furthermore, this study will further developments that could benefit S.A. cities in general as they transform into smart cities.},

abstract = { Depth cameras provide a natural and intuitive user interaction mechanism in virtual reality environments by using hand gestures as the primary user input. However, building robust VR systems that use depth cameras are challenging. Gesture recognition accuracy is affected by occlusion, variation in hand orientation and misclassification of similar hand gestures. This research explores the limits of the Leap Motion depth camera for static hand pose recognition in virtual reality applications. We propose a system for analysing static hand poses and for systematically identifying a pose set that can achieve a near-perfect recognition accuracy. The system consists of a hand pose taxonomy, a pose notation, a machine learning classifier and an algorithm to identify a reliable pose set that can achieve near perfect accuracy levels. We used this system to construct a benchmark hand pose data set containing 2550 static hand pose instances, and show how the algorithm can be used to systematically derive a set of poses that can produce an accuracy of 99% using a Support Vector Machine classifier.},

abstract = { This paper proposes a static analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in Java programs. Security vulnerabilities are an ever-present concern for developers and researchers alike. Even a large-scale system can be breached or even rendered nonoperational if a security vulnerability is found and exploited by an attacker. As computer systems grow ever larger and more complex, the need for robust and precise tools for finding such vulnerabilities only grows as well. Most security vulnerabilities stem from untrusted input making its way to sensitive portions of the system, which can have serious consequences ranging from exposure of sensitive data to memory corruption and denial of service. The methods described in this paper allow the security analyst to model the program under analysis as a graph structure, which can then be traversed to find specific patterns that correspond to security vulnerabilities in the program. Techniques are described to build this structure and update it incrementally as the program itself changes during development, as well as perform various analyses to expose potential vulnerabilities. The methods are evaluated against a benchmark suite and shown to be effective in finding vulnerabilities arising from unchecked inputs.},

abstract = { Deep facial expression recognition faces two challenges that both stem from the large number of trainable parameters: long training times and a lack of interpretability. We propose a novel method based on evolutionary algorithms, that deals with both challenges by massively reducing the number of trainable parameters, whilst simultaneously retaining classification performance, and in some cases achieving superior performance. We are robustly able to reduce the number of parameters on average by 95% (e.g. from 2M to 100k parameters) with no loss in classification accuracy. The algorithm learns to choose small patches from the image, relative to the nose, which carry the most important information about emotion, and which coincide with typical human choices of important features. Our work implements a novel form attention and shows that evolutionary algorithms are a valuable addition to machine learning in the deep learning era, both for reducing the number of parameters for facial expression recognition and for providing interpretable features that can help reduce bias.},

abstract = {Academic libraries experience a lot of pressure due to rapid changes in technology, budget cuts and increasing demand of information services from their clientele. At the same time, libraries are expected to improve their information services at the global level to meet the increasing demands of libraries’ population. Therefore, an effective collaboration in academic libraries is not an option anymore, but a necessity in order to cope with the rapidly changing technologies and external pressures. Blockchain technology because of its capabilities to record transactions and digital interactions in a transparent, secure, resilient, efficient and traceable way across untrusted parties, offers new opportunities for academic libraries’ collaboration. However, due to its infancy stage of development, literature on blockchain technology adoption behavior is lacking, especially in the context of academic libraries. This therefore opens up the opportunities for further research in this area. Based on the technology innovation theory and technology-organisation-environment framework, a conceptual research model has been developed to investigate the determinant factors of intention to adopt blockchain technology in South African academic libraries’ collaborative business processes. This conceptual paper also gives directions for future research in the form of 11 hypotheses.},

The focus will be to provide this from a South African perspective. The methodology applied in this paper to analyze the literature to determine the minimum list, as well as the studies, is a qualitative descriptive exploratory study. Relevant and recent papers on DSRM were identified that provided various concepts for the minimum design elements requirements and specifically selected South African postgraduate studies (five graduated PhDs from 2017-2020) were analyzed to determine if and how these address the requirements list. It was found that all of the studies did address the identified minimum design element requirements for it to be regarded as a DSRM study. During the findings, some challenges experienced by the students and from the literature support the minimum design elements requirements. New opportunities that emerged are multi- and transdisciplinary implementations of artefacts and allowing students to develop methodological dexterity.},
