abstract = {This paper proposes a new design notation to improve communication between members of teams creating virtual environments (VEs). Commonly, programmers and designers creating VEs do not use the same formalisms or design techniques. Consequently, ambiguity and misunderstandings can bedevil VE design and production processes. After teaching a selection of specification techniques to design students, we realized that we needed to create our own formalism. We used this notation with designers who found it useful and intuitive. More importantly, programmers were able to interpret the formalism more accurately and reduce the time required to create virtual environments than was possible using a design document alone.},

The paper shows how this tool uses FGTs to build composite refactorings from primitive refactorings. It indicates how composite-level and FGT-enabling preconditions can be derived and utilised to avoid the rollback problem. FGT-based composite refactorings therefore retain the advantages of building composite refactorings from primitive ones, but simultaneously offer the additional potential benefits to be derived from a more fine-grained exposition of the refactoring task.},

abstract = {Malaria continues to be one of the most serious global health challenges. The increasing incidence of drug resistant Plasmodium strains has emphasised the need for urgent action in the development of new therapeutic strategies against this disease. Development of new drug targets is of vital importance in this regard. The recent availability of genomic information and the resultant observation that in many instances, protein kinases from parasitic protozoa are phylogenetically distant from those in humans has established this group of enzymes as potential drug targets in the Malaria parasite. In order to rationally design novel inhibitors and chemical tools exclusively targeting CDPKs, reliable molecular structures are needed. Structural Bioinformatics, specifically molecular modelling, can contribute immensely to improving access to structural information for these challenging targets. Here, a three dimensional structure of PfCDPK4 created by homology modelling is reported. Further, a model structure with computationally docked ATP is created. These structures will be used to facilitate the discovery and development of novel inhibitors and chemical proteomics tools for the study of this sub-family of proteins.},

abstract = {Maillogs contain important information about mail which has been sent or received. This information can be used for statistical purposes, to help prevent viruses or to help prevent SPAM. In order to satisfy regulations and follow good security practices, maillogs need to be monitored and archived. Since there is a large quantity of data, some form of data reduction is necessary. Data compression programs such as gzip and bzip2 are commonly used to reduce the quantity of data. Text preprocessing can be used to aid the compression of English text files. This paper evaluates whether text preprocessing, particularly word replacement, can be used to improve the compression of maillogs. It presents an algorithm for constructing a dictionary for word replacement and provides the results of experiments conducted using the ppmd, gzip, bzip2 and 7zip programs. These tests show that text preprocessing improves data compression on maillogs. Improvements of up to 56 percent in compression time and up to 32 percent in compression ratio are achieved. It also shows that a dictionary may be generated and used on other maillogs to yield reductions within half a percent of the results achieved for the maillog used to generate the dictionary.},

The standard Minimax algorithm requires too much processing time to be useful in all but the simplest games. Utilizing a neural network to limit the size of the game tree searched by Minimax greatly reduces the processing time required. A case study of Tic-Tac-Toe on larger boards was implemented to validate the new approach. Experimental evidence is presented that indicates that the suggested algorithm yields an effective player even though the search space is substantial.},

Such an implementation process is a comprehensive course of action that requires focus and commitment through-out the organisation in order to achieve results, yet no universally accepted framework or methodology for such a process exists.This paper analyses and describes enhancements to a 12-step process derived by Calabrese and Orlando [6] to implement a knowledge management system aimed at providing a more comprehensive framework and methodology for knowledge management system implementation. These enhancements are based on findings relating to a knowledge management proof of concept implementation conducted at one of the major mobile telecommunication operators in South Africa.},

With the advent of much faster mobile phone processors and memory we are now seeing a plethora of feature rich software being deployed onto the mobile platform. Since these high powered smart phones are now equipped with cameras, it has become feasible to combine their powerful processors and the camera to support new ways of interacting with the phone. However, it is not clear whether or not these processor intensive visual interactions can in fact be run at an acceptable speed on current mobile handsets. In this paper we look at one of the most popular and widespread mobile smart phone systems; the Symbian s60 and benchmark the speed, accuracy and deployability of the three popular mobile languages. We test a pixel thresholding algorithm in, C++, Python and Java and rank them based on their speed within the context of intensive image based processing.},

Although there are two distinct methods, namely the Glaserian and the Straussian versions, a substantial number of research articles tend to ignore the difference and just claim that they are using grounded theory. To a researcher new to the grounded theory method, the two methods look very similar. Because the Straussian method is more prescriptive, most opt to follow this method, without investigating the Glaserian version. The few who try to use a hybrid of the two methods (not appreciating that the two methods are substantially different), only realize after a significant investment in time that the methods are not reconcilable and that either the one or the other should be followed. To contribute towards eliminating the confusion, this paper investigates the differences between the two methods. This will, hopefully, enable ICT researchers to make a more informed decision on which method to follow.},

This happens especially when dealing with applications such as multimedia streaming that distribute time continuous data with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements like bandwidth, jitter, delay and packet loss. Session handover can solve this problem by ensuring service continuity through minimization of flow interruptions when users are mobile. Building upon a new Bayesian Belief framework, this paper proposes a context-aware handoff decision process that uses a multi-criteria decision making model to support QoS-based mobility in wireless networks. Using the widely deployed "Hugin Expert" Bayesian belief support tool, we illustrate its deployment in a network environment where mobility decisions are taken to roam around Wi-Fi or Bluetooth networks.},

abstract = {The strengths and weaknesses of heuristic evaluation have been well researched. Despite known weaknesses, heuristic evaluation is still widely used since formal usability testing (also referred to as empirical user testing) is more costly and time consuming. What has received less attention is the type of information heuristic evaluation conveys in comparison to empirical user testing supported by eye tracking and user observation. If usability methods are combined, it becomes even more important to distinguish the information contribution by each method. This paper investigates the application of two usability evaluation methods, namely heuristic evaluation and empirical user testing supported by eye tracking, to the website of a learning management system with the intent of discovering the difference in the usability information yielded. Heuristic evaluation as an inspection method is accepted to be fundamentally different from empirical user testing. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the nature of the differences by identifying the kind of usability problems identified through each method. The findings should be of interest to researchers, designers and usability practitioners involved in website design and evaluation.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an alternative to the office metaphor for African users unfamiliar with the office environment. The objective of the research was to identify users for whom the African Village metaphor is better than the office metaphor. Five widely used African cultural objects were identified for the design of user interface icons for the African Village metaphor. Computer Science and Information Technology staff members from four universities in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire requested participants to identify icons from the current office metaphor, identify the five African objects, to indicate their traditional use, associate these objects with computer actions, and indicate their level of support for the African Village metaphor. Participants were grouped according to age and culture. The data were analysed using proportions, means and correlation analysis. Results indicate that in all age groups a larger proportion of African users support the African Village metaphor compared to users from other cultural groups, and that support is almost null among young users from other cultural groups. On the ability to associate African objects with computer actions, older African users performed better than younger Africans, but younger users from other cultural groups performed better than their peers. On the knowledge of African cultural objects, young African participants performed worse compared to young participants from other cultures. A significant correlation was found between knowledge of cultural objects and ability to associate computer actions with cultural objects. The research results show the African Village metaphor is more suitable for older African users than the office metaphor. The paper assesses the effectiveness of a possible alternative to the office metaphor, capable of improving usability especially for African users and contribute towards improving computer literacy for this group of users.},

This study investigates whether there is a difference in the plagiarism behaviour of students committing plagiarism for "acceptable" reasons as compared to "unacceptable" reasons so that an automated support tool for novice programmers might be viable. It was found that the reasons for committing plagiarism are most likely due to a lack of knowledge and that students commit plagiarism as a last resort in many cases. It was also found that there were differences between the behaviour of students plagiarising for "acceptable" and "unacceptable" reasons. Below average students plagiarising multiple lines of source code up to a complete method most likely do so for "acceptable" reasons. It was not possible to distinguish between "acceptable" and "unacceptable" plagiarising behaviour for above average subjects, but the plagiarising of multiple classes or files was almost always for "unacceptable" reasons.},

abstract = {Object Relational Mapping (ORM or also known as O-R) tools provide a mapping between the object model and the relational model, acting as an intermediary between an object oriented code base, and a relational database. Over the last few years the use of object relational mapping tools have grown. Today their exist many ORM tools for programming languages, like C++ (LiteSQL), Java (Hibernate, Apache OJB), Python (SQLAlchemy), Ruby, PHP, .Net (iBATIS) and Perl to name a few. ORM tools provide an extra layer between the business logic layer and the data layer. It is important that this layer is not a bottleneck. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of this extra layer against the use of object databases that remove the need for this extra mapping layer. During this investigation the impact of certain optimisation techniques on performance was investigated. In this paper we only report on how vendor-recommended optimisation techniques influenced the performance of Hibernate. The OO7 benchmark, tailored to investigate Java based object persistence, was used to create a database; to traverse it; to query it; and to delete and update data. An initial experiment used "out of the box" Hibernate settings with regard to the use of indexes, lazy and eager loading, and caching. The times taken were submitted to Hibernate for comment. The experiment was then re-run, using optimised settings as recommended by the vendor. The extent of improvement is reported.},

abstract = {Packet analysis is an important aspect of network security, which typically relies on a flexible packet filtering system to extrapolate important packet information from each processed packet. Packet analysis is a computationally intensive, highly parallelisable task, and as such, classification of large packet sets, such as those collected by a network telescope, can require significant processing time. We wish to improve upon this, through parallel classification on a GPU. In this paper, we first consider the OpenCL architecture and its applicability to packet analysis. We then introduce a number of packet demultiplexing and routing algorithms, and finally present a discussion on how some of these techniques may be leveraged within a GPGPU context to improve packet classification speeds.},

Consequently, the potential for the use of an ANN in this regard has been investigated in this paper. This simulator Neural Network (NN) was trained to predict changes in the position and orientation resulting from arbitrary motor commands sent to a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot moving in a two-dimensional plane. The proposed NN simulator was employed as an alternative to conventional physics-engine based simulators to evolve simple navigation behaviour in said robot and encouraging results were obtained.},

In this article a critical interpretive analysis of the international discourse about women in IT is performed. The aim is to understand why women experience such a low level of career satisfaction in IT by taking their experiences and the context of the IT industry into consideration. The authors will critically analyse the results from the interpretive analysis and challenge the reasons identified as the cause for the under-representation of women in the IT industry. This study can be used to gain more insight into and understanding (reflection) of the current situation, but it can also contribute to communities such as feminists or governments in the creation of an emancipation theory or a series of interventions to improve the situation for women in IT.},

Previous work applying this approach to the uncapacitated examination timetabling problem revealed areas for improvement. These included the need for a soft constraint measure in the heuristic used to assess the difficulties of allocating examinations and an investigation into the effectiveness of different application rates of cell migration and cell interaction. The study presented in this paper addresses these areas. The performance of the revised system is compared to the previous version and other biologically-inspired methodologies applied to the same problem set, as well as that of methods cited as producing one or more best results for the benchmarks.},

abstract = {E-Government has increasingly become an alternative for enabling public governance at various. The situation is especially poignant in developing countries where there are increasing calls to improve governance for improved national development. This study sought to investigate managerial processes in the alignment of e-government within Local Authorities in Kenya. A case study research design underpinned by critical realism assumptions was used. The analysis was grounded on empirical results of the study, and employed theoretical thematic analysis. Under the alienating conditions of social exclusion, the alignment of the e-government artifact espoused strong managerialist orientations of augmenting and reinforcing central governments control over its polity. A consequence of this alignment is a tendency towards technocratic evolution of the public service delivery system in local authorities in Kenya. However, it was also recognised that the form of e-government projects are constantly in flux, and that relying on a single case was therefore a limitation of the study.
