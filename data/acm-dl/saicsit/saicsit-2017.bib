abstract = {Media freedom encourages development of society, leading to growing and sustainable democracies and healthy social, political, and economic engagement Mobile news services (MNSs) are one means to reach out to citizens to share news and provide citizens with a forum to critique and voice opinion. Current findings suggest that there is minimal research and understanding of the adoption of these mobile news services. The purpose of this study was to propose and validate a theoretical framework that articulates factors influencing the adoption of mobile news services in South Africa. A review of the literature on mobile news services and technology adoption helped to identify potential factors. Multiple interpretive case studies were conducted to understand the adoption of mobile news services within the local context. Thematic analysis supported the identification of key influencing factors of MNS adoption. The resultant MNS adoption model offers new insight in the adoption of mobile news services in terms of social factors, attributes of adopters and attributes of innovation. The results are also useful to mobile news service providers, designers, and developers, in their endeavour to satisfy distinct news consumer's needs.},

abstract = {Structured Query Language (SQL) is popular with relational databases. Despite the simple and highly structured nature of SQL, end users often find it difficult to comprehend written queries and/or write new queries. Hence, a number of tools have been proposed to aid the comprehension of SQL queries via visualisation. In this paper, we present a different comprehension aid called narrations. Narrations are non-technical, textual descriptions of SQL queries. Using a representation of regular languages, regular expressions, we have designed a tool, called S-NAR (or Sql-NARrator), that reads queries and generates a narration of these queries using pre-defined templates. S-NAR was tested with 5,000 queries and narrated 96% of the queries. The generated narrations should find applications in aiding comprehension in the teaching of database courses at higher institutions of learning, and assisting the comprehension of legacy queries in data-centered industries.},

abstract = {The evaluation of M-Commerce applications is becoming a must for both business and usability professionals. Heuristics evaluation of M-Commerce application seems to be a way out, but traditional heuristics were developed without any consideration for mobile computing. Therefore, the need to have domain specific heuristics is gradually gaining popularity, which have led to the development of domain specific heuristics for M-Health, M-Games and M-Museums, among others. In the light of this, there is a literature gap for the development of domain specific heuristics for M-Commerce applications, which this study seeks to address. The study presents the set of heuristics for M-Commerce applications in a pattern that is similar to traditional heuristics, but with much emphasis on the context of use. The study serves as initial work on the development of domain specific heuristics for the evaluation of M-Commerce applications. The proposed heuristics could be of benefit to usability professionals, significantly reducing the cost and enhancing the outcome of usability evaluations in the context of},

abstract = {Hackathons and similar innovation contests can accelerate the development of software prototypes to help large corporates such as banks experiment with new technology. These companies may also be adopting Agile in their existing software development practices and it is worth exploring the usage of Agile principles at such events and whether hackathons can assist overall Agile adoption. FNB is one of the largest and most innovative banks in South Africa and runs an internal hackathon called Codefest to enhance IT innovation in product design and internal operations. The event attracts over 200 internal developers who compete in teams during a 48-hour coding marathon. South African banks, including FNB, are also adopting Agile practices to improve speed and quality in their software development lifecycle. Codefest was not intended to help drive FNB's Agile journey, however some of its principles and practices were observed as having naturally occurred during the event.This article explores the emergence of Agile practices at FNB Codefest as observed during publicly broadcast interviews with various participants and stakeholders. The spoken words of the interviewees were analysed for dominant concepts using the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto as a coding framework. The interviews provided practical observations of the environment at Codefest which was found to encourage certain Agile principles and practices. Adoption of Agile by teams also correlated with their level of success in the Codefest competition however more research would be needed to determine whether Codefest accelerated the bank's overall Agile journey.Three main Agile concepts were found to be naturally cultivated by the environment of Codefest; collaboration, motivation and elements of technical excellence. Collaboration was observed between IT teams, between business and IT teams and between business teams, while also creating a model of conditions for how teams could operate during business as usual. Intrinsic motivators such as autonomy, mastery and purpose were also observed at codefest, supporting the notion of knowledge worker motivation as being crucial in setting up successful software development teams. Elements of technical excellence correlated to Agile through methodologies such as Extreme Programming or Scrum while quality practices were enabled by team practices such as communication and planning. Codefest was also mapped to a proposed model of Agile environments while considerations for such contests and suggestions for next steps are also presented. These include (1) using Codefest to raise awareness of Agile, (2) understanding how extrinsic motivators affect Codefest and Agile, (3) using Codefest participants to share and drive technical excellence and (4) Agile training before Codefest.},

abstract = {Detecting and localizing facial regions in images is a fundamental building block of many applications in the field of affective computing and human-computer interaction. This allows systems to do a variety of higher level analysis such as facial expression recognition. Facial expression recognition is based on the effective extraction of relevant facial features. Many techniques have been proposed to deal with the robust extraction of these features under a wide variety of poses and occlusion conditions. These techniques include Deformable Part Models (DPM's), and more recently deep Convolutional neural networks (CNN's). Recently, hybrid models based on DPMs and CNNs have been proposed considering the generalization properties of CNNs and DPMs. In this work we propose a combined system, using CNN's as features for a DPM with a focus on dealing with occlusion.We also propose a method of face detection allowing occluded regions to be detected and explicitly ignored during the detection step. The resulting system is quite robust to a wide variety of occlusions achieving accuracies comparable to that of other state of the art systems.},

abstract = {Unsupervised morphological segmentation is attractive for low density languages that have little linguistic description, such as many of the Bantu languages. However, techniques that cluster morphologically related words use string similarity metrics that are more suited for languages that have simple morphological systems. This paper proposes a weighted similarity measure that uses normal distribution for calculating Ordered Weighted Aggregator (OWA) operator weights. The weighting favours shared character sequences that are likely to be part of stems in highly agglutinative languages. The approach is evaluated on text for Chichewa and Citumbuka, both belonging to group N of the Guthrie Bantu languages classification. Cluster analysis results show that the proposed weighted word similarity metric produces better clusters than the Dice Coefficient. Morpheme segmentation results on clusters generated using the OWA weights metric are comparable to the state-of-the-art morphological analysis tools.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) presents a dynamic global revolution in the Internet where physical and virtual "things" communicate and share information. There arises a need to allow heterogeneous "things" to seamlessly interoperate, interact and exchange information and subsequently share services. Services are represented as functionalities that are offered by the "things". In IoT context, service orchestration refers to identifying which devices or software components are required to formulate the requested service. IoT devices can offer different services based on the context and semantics. Service orchestration provides an approach to integration and interoperability which decouples applications from each other, and enhances capabilities to centrally manage and monitor components. This paper investigates requirements for semantic interoperability and exposes current challenges in IoT interoperability as a means of facilitating services orchestration in IoT. The paper proposes a semantic platform that allows heterogeneous devices to collaborate thereby enabling dynamic service orchestration. The proposed platform provides a common ontology-based framework for representing semantics allowing for a consistent information exchange format. The approach used combines domain-specific ontologies to obtain device and service abstraction for the purposes of process mining and analysis of service orchestration in heterogonous IoT environments. This approach was evaluated using a prototype IoT environment and mining techniques developed in the Process Mining Framework (ProM). The results revealed that semantically enriching service annotation and device descriptions through ontologies can successfully enable interoperability in heterogeneous IoT environments. Semantically enriched descriptions enable multiple perspectives of analysis on service orchestration processes and expose the steps involved in service request and provision in an a typical IoT setup.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of mobile devices, provision of M-health care services has become feasible even in the remotest villages of Africa. Research however shows that many M-health initiatives have not been adopted and used effectively especially in rural communities. Some of the factors contributing to this range from a lack of knowledge with regard the use of technology, literacy challenges, possible fear of technology, to a lack of information regarding these interventions.In this paper, we demonstrate that an initiative designed to recognize usability as its core function plays a critical role in the use and adoption of M-health interventions in rural communities. Two versions of an M-health intervention were developed and two interface design principles that may have an impact on users' emotions applied, namely affective design and anthropomorphism.Using the Sethakeng rural community in the Northern Cape (South Africa) as the case study, we were able to determine the extent to which both anthropomorphism and affective design influence the adoption of an M-Health application. Further, the research revealed that because of its ability to include human-like qualities to non-living objects, anthropomorphism is a more effective method for designing M-Health applications targeting rural communities.},

BI has been successfully applied to promote good decision making in a variety of environments, and has high potential to make a significant impact in the domain of population health. The promotion of population health is a key concern of government authorities and various health institutions and officials making decisions about interventions that may impact on population health would benefit from the use of information on population health. BI could clearly be a facilitator in this regard, but evidence of its current application and impact in this field is not easily accessible to policy makers. This systematic literature review explored the literature and provided a synthesis of information available on the current use of BI in this area, and evidence of the impact of its use on population health. An array of applications of BI for population health were found, including data warehouses, analytics, reports, data warehouse browsers, OLAP, GIS, Dashboards and Alerts. Evidence of the impact of these applications on population health was mainly anecdotal, with only one empirical study found. Issues and challenges encountered in the development and use of BI are Privacy and Security, Data Quality and Development and Maintenance of BI infrastructure},

The overall accuracy, accuracy across facial expression classes, robustness to test subjects, and the ability to generalise of each feature descriptor within the context of automatic facial expression recognition are analysed as part of the comparison procedure. Overall, HOG proved to be a more robust feature descriptor to the LBP and CLBP. Furthermore, the CLBP can generally be considered to be superior to the LBP, but the LBP has greater potential in terms of its ability to generalise.},

abstract = {The ability to identify sentiment in text, referred to as sentiment analysis, is one which is natural to adult humans. This task is, however, not one which a computer can perform by default. Identifying sentiments in an automated, algorithmic manner will be a useful capability for business and research in their search to understand what consumers think about their products or services and to understand human sociology. Here we propose two new Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for the task of automated text sentiment analysis. The GAs learn whether words occurring in a text corpus are either sentiment or amplifier words, and their corresponding magnitude. Sentiment words, such as 'horrible', add linearly to the final sentiment. Amplifier words in contrast, which are typically adjectives/adverbs like 'very', multiply the sentiment of the following word. This increases, decreases or negates the sentiment of the following word. The sentiment of the full text is then the sum of these terms. This approach grows both a sentiment and amplifier dictionary which can be reused for other purposes and fed into other machine learning algorithms. We report the results of multiple experiments conducted on large Amazon data sets. The results reveal that our proposed approach was able to outperform several public and/or commercial sentiment analysis algorithms.},

abstract = {Regression or classification? This is perhaps the most basic question faced when tackling a new supervised learning problem. We present an Evolutionary Deep Learning (EDL) algorithm that automatically solves this by identifying the question type with high accuracy, along with a proposed deep architecture. Typically, a significant amount of human insight and preparation is required prior to executing machine learning algorithms. For example, when creating deep neural networks, the number of parameters must be selected in advance and furthermore, a lot of these choices are made based upon pre-existing knowledge of the data such as the use of a categorical cross entropy loss function. Humans are able to study a dataset and decide whether it represents a classification or a regression problem, and consequently make decisions which will be applied to the execution of the neural network. We propose the Automated Problem Identification (API) algorithm, which uses an evolutionary algorithm interface to TensorFlow to manipulate a deep neural network to decide if a dataset represents a classification or a regression problem. We test API on 16 different classification, regression and sentiment analysis datasets with up to 10,000 features and up to 17,000 unique target values. API achieves an average accuracy of 96.3% in identifying the problem type without hard-coding any insights about the general characteristics of regression or classification problems. For example, API successfully identifies classification problems even with 1000 target values. Furthermore, the algorithm recommends which loss function to use and also recommends a neural network architecture. Our work is therefore a step towards fully automated machine learning.},

A shooting genre game was developed, and a task was included during development to simulate gaming actions with moving targets. Data for four efficiency metrics was gathered during two phases of user testing. The low sensitivity setting resulted in the fastest gameplay for users without disabilities, which contradicted research results from studies focusing on individuals with disabilities. It was also found that the amount of neck fatigue decreased after several sessions for users without disabilities. The efficient use of the head mouse by individuals without disabilities showed significant improvement over time for certain elements, indicating that learning took place. The level of user satisfaction also increased with extended use of the head mouse by individuals without disabilities. Although some findings can be generalized to both types of users, this study shows that new knowledge was gained in terms of able bodied use of a head mouse.},

Various optimization flags are enabled at compile-time and the output of the binary executable's EM signatures are captured at run-time. It is demonstrated that GNU and clang compilers produced different EM signature on program execution. The results indicated while utilizing the O3 optimization flag, the EM signature of the program changes. Additionally, the g++ compiler demonstrated fewer instructions were required to run the executable; this related to fewer EM emissions leaked. The EM data from the various compilers under different optimization levels was used as input data for a correlation power analysis attack. The results indicated that partial AES-128 encryption keys was possible. In addition, the fewest subkeys recovered was when the clang compiler was used with level O2 optimization. Finally, the research was able to recover 15 of 16 AES-128 cryptographic algorithm's subkeys, from the the Pi.},

abstract = {The literature shows a growth in the number of publications on e-Government in some African countries, but little is known on e-Government in Namibia. Furthermore, few studies evaluated e-Government from the citizens' perspective in an African context. The study argues that the focus on e-Government has to shift to the citizens' viewpoint and determine the impact on different segments of the population. Accordingly, this study investigates factors contributing to social exclusion in Namibia. Namibia has an e-Government framework for the years 2014 to 2018 and hence there is a need to evaluate the progress on e-Government implementation. The study is an exploratory case study in a governmental Ministry using questionnaires and interviews. Participants included citizens seeking services and government officials providing the services. The findings include the need for e-government services to be interactive, accessible and available on mobile phones.},

abstract = {While there are clear efforts towards managing veld fires, it comes as a concern that in Southern Africa, the role of local communities in fire control has weakened and veld fires have grown to be a major threat. Current systems and technologies to share veld fire information have several challenges. These include; being unable to detect burning fires in the forests, poor to almost missing veld fire local alerting systems, and malfunctioning local veld firefighting communities. Against this background, a mobile veld fire detection and sharing application prototype was developed using a qualitative data approach and experimental design. Weather data and scientific models of different areas were used to create fire-danger indices based on forecasted weather data and weather station information on the ground. These were programmed into the system to trigger alerts for the veld fire prediction component. For the identification of already burning fires, this was linked to the MODIS system of firefighting stakeholders (EMA Zimbabwe). Results revealed that conditions that promote veld fires can be predicted and local residents can thus be warned instantly to avoid activities that cause fires. For already burning fires, the mobile application was able to instantly communicate to users registered to the system.},

abstract = {Health organizations are increasingly investing in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for benefits related to work-process-optimization. One of these benefits is the efficient management of patient records through the use of Electronic Health Records (EHR). An EHR can be referred to as electronic Patient Records Management (PRM). With electronic PRM the process of creation, retrieval, storage and even billing of patients and patient information are aided and automated by ICT. Impact assessment studies on ICT, in particular electronic PRM, are necessary to support investment efforts. An impact assessment would gauge the change brought about by the use of technologies such as electronic PRM systems. In the healthcare setting, nurses are primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations and monitoring of the health progress and care-giving of patients. As such, they could be considered primary aid to patients. The Ministry of Health and Social Services (MOHSS) in Namibia has not conducted impact assessment on electronic PRM specifically from nurses perceptions, as no such framework exists. The lack of such a framework for impact assessment purposes could be a challenge in supporting investment decisions towards ICT in the public healthcare sector. The aim of this research paper was to design an electronic PRM impact assessment framework from a perception of nurses. The Windhoek Central Hospital was used as a case study. An interpretive approach was selected for the research paradigm in this study. Qualitative data gathering from participants of the public healthcare was possible because of this approach. The modes of data collection consisted of semi structured interviews and questionnaires. A total of 36 questionnaires were distributed to nurses as the primary users of the electronic PRM system in Windhoek Central Hospital. Additionally, two interviews were conducted. A thematic analysis of data was conducted on the information from the interviews and questionnaires. The result of the study was a framework consisting of key players namely nurses and the electronic PRM system with factors linking the key players. The factors are efficiency and key values of the electronic PRM system.},

abstract = {Modularity has been proposed as a solution to deal with large ontologies. This requires, various module management tasks, such as swapping an outdated module for a new one or a computationally costly one for a leaner fragment. No mechanism exists to exchange an arbitrary module automatically. To solve this manual task, we modify the SUGOI algorithm into SUGOI-Gen; with SUGOI-Gen, one can swap any module within a modular system, implemented it, and wrapped a GUI around it. We carried out an experimental evaluation with six ontologies covering three different use-cases to determine whether arbitrary interchangeability is practically doable, and to what extent such changes affect the quality of the module and automated reasoning over it. The results are positive, with the success rate varying between 22--100% depending on the number of mappings between the source and target module. The evaluation also revealed that the interchangeability does indeed have an impact on a module's metrics. Regarding reasoning, when comparing an original ontology to one where a module has been swapped, the processing time is greatly improved for all except one of the swapped modules in the set.},

abstract = {Location based services (LBS) targeted at the smartphone market are increasing in prevalence and have given rise to a plethora of location-aware applications for both indoor and outdoor contexts. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used extensively in many of these applications for location mapping, however GPS is known to have serious limitations indoors due to signal blocking. In this work, Wi-Fi Positioning Systems (WPS) are explored with the aim of identifying a suitable alternative that works well indoors. This paper details the design of a WPS whose positioning component includes the use of trilateration and variants of the k-nearest neighbour algorithm. The resulting positioning component was tested indoors in two separate environments of different sizes, yielding an accuracy of within 1.6 m in the best-case scenario, which greatly outperforms GPS under similar conditions. Arguably, the positioning component can form the basis for any number of LBS, however in this paper; its use in supporting Augmented Reality (AR) is explored. The AR component incorporates context and preference features and permits the exploration of indoor physical spaces while layering graphical content onto the standby camera display. The resulting application was coined ARrowhead. ARrowhead was tested qualitatively and verified to perform as expected. The prototype provides a foundation for further development.},

abstract = {Human detection on static images remains a challenging research problem. This work evaluates the significance of using infrared imaging (IIR) over several human detection systems. Larger complexities arise when detecting people in colour images due to the possibility of random colour patterns on the image backgrounds and clothes of pedestrians. In most cases, the colour clutter contributes negatively to image representation methods that solely rely on edge information. The basis of our supposition is that the choice of information has a large impact on the robustness of statistical learning systems. To test this supposition, we created and published a new infrared-based pedestrian dataset called "SIGNI" [9].Several datasets of the same size were prepared and tested on three different classifiers. The classifiers are first trained with popular colour datasets to determine the optimal parameters that obtain high classification rates on unseen samples. Once satisfactory results are obtained, the same parameters are used for training the classifiers with infrared samples. The conventional use of support vector machines (SVM) on HOG features is tested against extreme learning machines (ELM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The results obtained show that the reduction of noise clutter improves the quality of acquired HOG features. As slight performance gains were observed during the classification of infrared samples over the use of visual samples.},

abstract = {Video on Demand (VoD) is a challenging area requiring complex server and distributed systems architectures. In this paper I describe an alternative implementation of VoD that exploits the growing affordability of fibre bandwidth to remove the latency problems of scaling up VoD. I call the general principle Information Mass Transit (IMT). By analogy with regular mass transit, making all traffic move in bulk without individual service variation makes for a much more efficient system. The core idea is to broadcast the same movie repeatedly at short intervals. To explicate the design, I set this interval at 1 minute, implying a latency of up to a minute to start a movie. However, this latency can be disguised if a user has a catalogue of movies that includes the first minute of each. Provided the number of users is much higher than the number of movies, this approach is affordable in terms of bandwidth and totally removes any need for servers or network infrastructure, beyond new connections for new users, to scale with the number of users. I call this approach Scalable Architecture for Video on Demand or SAVoD.},

abstract = {Social media has been gaining popularity among university students who use social media at higher rates than the general population. Students consequently spend a significant amount of time on social media, which may inevitably have an effect on their academic engagement. Subsequently, scholars have been intrigued to examine the impact of social media on students' academic engagement. Research that has directly explored the use of social media and its impact on students in tertiary institutions has revealed limited and mixed findings, particularly within a South African context; thus leaving a window of opportunity to further investigate the impact that social media has on students' academic engagement. This study therefore aims to investigate the use of social media in tertiary institutions, the impact that the use thereof has on students' academic engagement and to suggest effective ways of using social media in tertiary institutions to improve students' academic engagement from students' perspectives. This study used an interpretivist (inductive) approach in order to determine and comprehend student's perspectives and experiences towards the use of social media and the effects thereof on their academic engagement. A single case study design at Rhodes University was used to determine students' perceptions and data was collected using an online survey. The findings reveal that students use social media for both social and academic purposes. Students further perceived that social media has a positive impact on their academic engagement and suggest that using social media at tertiary level could be advantageous and could enhance students' academic engagement.},

abstract = {Actor-network theory (ANT) has been gaining popularity as a guiding theoretical apparatus in Information Systems (IS) research, notably research involving IS projects as such projects are seen as assemblages of people, technologies, project documents, methodologies, and other actors. A key tenet of ANT is generalized symmetry, which advocates that human and material actors be viewed on the same analytic plane. A persistent critique of ANT-based IS research is that researchers employing ANT routinely fail to uphold the ideal of generalized symmetry. Critics often point out that many ANT-based IS research accounts (whether consciously or unconsciously) privilege humans as the dominant actors in actor-networks, while paying lip-service to the idea of generalized symmetry for all actors. This paper contributes toward understanding the underlying issues of this critique by assessing the current level of compliance to ANT's principle of generalized symmetry in ANT-based IS research. Using a hermeneutic literature review approach, we investigate how the main constructs, principles, practices and techniques of the full apparatus of ANT have been identified, applied and documented in recent ANT-based IS research studies as reported in the extant literature. This review provides an updated and refreshed understanding of the current level to which ANT's principle of generalized symmetry is upheld in ANT-based IS research.},

The region has a number of institutions, enterprises and initiatives in place to realise this goal. A study---taking into account the information technology practitioner's perspective---was undertaken within the Cape Town region to determine the promotion of software development within the Western Cape and the role which universities can play in the support thereof. A grounded theory research approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods was used. This study found that the main stakeholders do not promote the software industry enough. Key initiatives that should be considered include: universities need to configure their curriculum appropriately for industry needs; more awareness around software development should be created particularly at school level in order to attract more students; and universities should build partnerships with industry. At the macro level, government, through policies and funding mechanisms for education and innovation in general, should create an enabling environment to foster these initiatives. Potential hindrances to achieving these initiatives are poor management of academic programmes, underfunding of the sector and a shortage of staff.},

abstract = {A functional and efficient health information system has the potential to improve a nation's health system. Consequently, hospitals in developing countries are recognising the need for implementing electronic hospital information systems (HIS). However, implementation efforts have been fraught with sustainability challenges related to system use. As such, understanding the factors associated with HIS acceptance is crucial to researchers and management stakeholders alike. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to ascertain the influence of locus of control and computer self-efficacy on user acceptance of HIS. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was the theoretical framework underpinning the study. A cross-sectional study was conducted in five Nigerian tertiary hospitals. Data were collected from 442 health information management (HIM) personnel who were the primary users of the HIM. Collected data were analysed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique (PLS-SEM). Findings show that locus of control significantly influences perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Computer self-efficacy had a significant influence on perceived ease of use and behavioural intention to use. Also, findings from the study upheld TAM as a valid model for assessing user acceptance of HIS from a developing country perspective. It was concluded that locus of control and computer self-efficacy as personality variables when integrated into TAM could provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.},

The building blocks for factorisation should already have been established in Grades 4, 5 and 6. Knowing the divisibility rules, will assist learners to simplify mathematical calculations such as factorisation of numbers, manipulating fractions and determining if a given number is a prime number. When a learner has to indicate, by only giving the answer, if a dividend is divisible by a certain single digit divisor, the teacher has no insight in the learner's reasoning. If the answer is correct, the teacher does not know if the learner guessed the answer or applied the divisibility rule correctly or incorrectly.A pre-post experiment design was used to investigate the effect of revision on the difference in gaze behaviour of learners before and after revision of divisibility rules. The gaze behaviour was analysed before they respond to a question on divisibility.It is suggested that if teachers have access to learners' answers, motivations and gaze behaviour, they can identify if learners (i) guessed the answers, (ii) applied the divisibility rules correctly, (iii) applied the divisibility rules correctly but made mental calculation errors, or (iv) applied the divisibility rules wrongly.},

We captured this essence in the form of a comprehensive definition as well as a list of essential criteria exhibited by effective knowledge visualisations. Using these, we moved on to address the lack of guidance by producing a set of knowledge visualisation guidelines. We report on how we derived and evaluated these guidelines.The guidelines, despite the rigorous derivation process, did not help the evaluators to produce effective visualisations. We reflect on the reasons for this and report on a number of lessons learned during the process. We conclude by suggesting a direction for future research.},

User resistance is a complex phenomenon often cited as a barrier to successful implementations. It is often taken at face value and is perceived as a negative factorng which most managers strive to overcome. Many HEIs have implemented ICTs but the uptake, is low. Gaining insights on user resistance could inform implementation strategies, aimed to improve uptake of ICTs. This study employs a model of resistance as a theoretical lens to investigate user resistance in HEIs. We examine resistance behaviours during the implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS). We identify objects, initial conditions, triggers and forms of resistance. Findings show that disinterest, minimal use, refusal to use, pessimism, withdrawal, avoidance, and prioritization are key forms of resistance behaviours. We also identify delegation of duties as a unique form of resistance that falsifies acceptance. Practical implications of the study could inform implementers to develop change management strategies that take into account specific resistance behaviours.},

abstract = {Persons with certain disabilities face barriers to information access and interpersonal communication. Assistive technologies provide workaround solutions to these problems. Augmentative and alternative communication systems aid the person with little or no functional speech to speak out loud. Screen readers and accessible e-books allow a print-disabled (visually-impaired, partially-sighted or dyslexic) individual to read text material by listening to audio versions. Text-to-speech synthesis converts electronic text into artificial speech and is used as the vocalisation component in the assistive technologies. For these three use cases, we report on an initial round of system integration and user engagement of the Qfrency text-to-speech voices that provide access to synthetic speech in the South African languages.},

abstract = {Simulation from formal specification is an important topic in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) research. Classical Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) are often used to write these specifications, but their concurrency operators are either too restrictive, or too lenient, to directly describe real-world WSN scenarios. In this paper we introduce a new optional parallel operator, based on previous work, that allows a process to 'opt out' of the all-synchronisation, as it would happen in real WSN scenarios where some node may run out of resources whilst other nodes continue to function. For its formal semantics, a translation of optional parallelism into classical CSP has been defined. This work also resulted in a notion of directional multi-way synchronisation, enabling various interesting broadcasting properties. Our evaluation of various WSN topology scenarios showed success in terms of deadlock freedom and trace refinement.},

abstract = {South African mining companies are required by law to keep record of all incidences, whether minor or major that occurred underground during the extraction of mineral resources. Reports on mine incidents must be provided to the Department of Mineral Resources as and when required. The process of compiling and producing incident reports is often laborious and error-prone, primarily because it is often done manually. This paper reports on a study that investigates end-users' acceptance and usage of an incident reporting system at a South African mine. The results showed discrepancies between participants' perceived usefulness and ease of use of the system, and their attitude toward, intention to use and perception of the system's relevance to their work.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a probabilistic programming environment for Java that is based on symbolic execution and model counting. The novelty of the framework is that the probability distributions in the program can themselves be symbolic, which allows parametric probabilistic programming. The framework handles typical probabilistic programming features, such as observe statements, and can be used for the encoding and analysis of Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC), Bayesian Networks, etc. We show two examples of using the system: (1) analysis of bubble sort when using an unreliable comparison operation, and, (2) analysis of a simulation model of autonomous aircraft towing vehicles, to show whether plans generated for these vehicles are robust when probability distributions are changed from the ones used to generate the plans.},

abstract = {South Africa is a linguistically diverse country: it is a home to 11 official languages of which nine, excluding English and Afrikaans, are Resource Scarce Languages (RSLs). Accordingly, many South Africans struggle to access information written in their native languages on the Web. Unfortunately, lack of access to information hinders social economic growth. This paper proposes a Web based digital library to act as a central repository for content written in these languages that is crawled from the Web, and generated or contributed by a community of users. Gamification features have been incorporated into the digital library to motivate users to contribute content to strengthen the collection of resources and to increase community participation. Specifically, the paper: (i) proposes a ranking algorithm, smart interleaving, to aggregate and rank multilingual search results effectively from collections of varying size; and (ii) investigates which gamification features, among leaderboard, notifications, virtual points and level, motivate users to contribute content in the context of South African RSLs. The results show that users were motivated to contribute more content to reach the next level than improving their leaderboard ranking or virtual points. Further, the overall results on merging and ranking multilingual search results show no significant improvement in using smart interleaving.},

abstract = {Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementations are increasing in most countries in the African continent and in Kenya in particular. Large, medium and small businesses in the country are making significant investments in these enterprise system (ES) implementations. This has given rise to the need for new roles within ES environments, most notably the Business Process Analyst (BPA). The BPA plays a critical role in understanding business processes of the organization. This is a critical requirement for any ES implementation. In this regard, the BPA competence requirements to implement and manage these ES implementations are not clear yet. More so, there is a lack of clarity regarding the interventions and interactions required to build critical competencies in entry level BPAs enabling them to move towards becoming fully fledged and experienced BPAs. To address this gap, this qualitative study focusing on the Kenyan context, utilizes the 4I framework of organizational learning to describe interventions and interactions that organizations use to build the required BPA competencies.},

abstract = {A number of current mobile prototyping tools exist that support designing prototypes for mobile platforms. Most of these tools do not support the use of mobile user interface (UI) design pattern collections or languages, such as Google's Material Design Pattern Library. Support is only provided for low-level physical widgets, such as butons and lists, and their behaviours. These prototypes are designed to be code-free, throwaway prototypes, and functionality cannot be added to them. The only functionality supported is the ability to link screens for simulation purposes. An existing feature of the mobile prototyping tool, Proto.io, was extended to support the use of selected Material Design Pattern Library patterns to generate prototype templates. A parser was written to convert these prototype templates, exported from Proto.io in HTML format, into Android-compatible XML that could be imported into the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), for further development. A user study was conducted to compare the two different approaches for creating a mobile application: creating the mobile application entirely in Android Studio, or using the extended version of Proto.io for designing the mobile UI, and importing the generated XML into Android Studio for further development. These two approaches were compared in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction, as evaluated by several designers. The mobile UI patterns-based approach was found to be superior to the development-centred approach.},
