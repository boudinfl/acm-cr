abstract = {Many types of user would find it valuable to search collections
of music via queries representing music fragments, but such
searching requires a reliable technique for identifying whether a
provided fragment occurs within a piece of music. The problem of
matching fragments to music is made difficult by the psychology of
music perception, because literal matching may have litile relation
to perceived melodic similarity, and by the interactions between
the multiple parts of typical pieces of music. In this paper we
analyse the propeties of music, music perception, and music
database users, and use the analysis to propose alternative
techniques for extracting monophonic melodies from polyphonic
music; we believe that such melodies can subsequently be used for
matching of queries to data. We report on experiments with music
listeners, which rank our proposed techniques for extracting
melodies.},
