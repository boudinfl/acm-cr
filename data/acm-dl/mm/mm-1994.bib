abstract = {In an on-demand video server environment, clients make requests for movies to a centralized video server. Due to the stringent response time requirements, continuous delivery of a video stream to the client has to be guaranteed by reserving sufficient resources required to deliver a stream. Hence there is a hard limit on the number of streams that can be simultaneously delivered by a server. The server can satisfy multiple requests for the same movie using a single disk I/O stream by sending the same data pages to multiple clients (using the multicast facility if present in the system). This can be achieved by batching requests for the same movie that arrive within a short duration of time. In this paper, we consider various policies for selecting the movie to be multicast. The choice of a policy depends very much on the customer waiting time tolerance before reneging. We show that an FCFS policy that schedules the movie with the longest outstanding request can perform better than the MQL policy that chooses the movie with the maximum number of outstanding requests. Additionally, if the user behavior can be influenced by guaranteeing maximum waiting time then it may be beneficial to pre-allocate a fixed number of streams for popular movies. Finally, we demonstrate using empirical distribution for movie requests, that a substantial reduction (of the order of 60%) in required server capacity can be achieved by batching.},

abstract = {Providing smooth playback capabilities for video servers, which must support potentially thousands of on-demand users, has been an area of active research. From a user's perspective, VCR functions of fast-forward and rewind (FF/Rew), are desirable features in video-on-demand. But FF/Rew at n times the regular playback rate requires n times the regular playback bandwidth from architectural components of the video server. Thus, guaranteeing sufficient bandwidth to enable users to perform FF/Rew reduces the number of supportable users by a factor of n. In this paper we propose an alternative, effective FF/Rew service, which provides FF/Rew capabilities with an associated statistical quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee. This service provides immediate access to full-resolution FF/Rew bandwidth with high probability. When bandwidth is not available, service is either delayed or provided immediately but with a loss in resolution. In addition, we specify several QoS metrics to characterize the delay or loss experienced by a FF/Rew request. We show that using effective FF/Rew with statistical guarantees on these QoS metrics results in a significant increase in the number of supportable users, when compared to systems in which FF/Rew bandwidth is statistically reserved for each user. Moreover, a playback-only video server can be extended to provide FF/Rew service by reserving only a small portion of its total bandwidth, which is dynamically shared among FF/Rew requests.},

abstract = {A large-scale multimedia server, in practice, has to service a large number of clients simultaneously. Given the real-time requirements of each client and the fixed data transfer bandwidth of disks, a multimedia server must employ admission control algorithms to decide whether a new client can be admitted for service without violating the requirements of the clients already being serviced. In this paper, we present an admission control algorithm for multimedia servers which: (1) exploits the variation in access times of media blocks from disk as well as the variation in client load induced by variable rate compression schemes, and (2) provides statistical service guarantees to each client. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through trace-driven simulations.},

In this study, multimedia presentations are considered as hierarchical compositions of time objects that define serial or parallel synchronization of the inserted media objects. Media composition hierarchies support automatic temporal layout mechanisms. They are integrated into an object-oriented application framework called MET++. It provides direct manipulation interaction on temporal structures in a composition view that displays temporal and compositional relations, allows time transformations on composites, supports the definition of time-dynamic behavior of media objects through time functions, and has a flexible graphical layout in order to visualize context information.},

This paper is a companion to another paper in this proceedings: “The Personal Presence System—A Wide Area Network Service Resource for the Real Time Composition of Multipoint Multimedia Communications” which contains a detailed service description.This paper describes the architecture of the Advanced Video Bridge (AVB) (Fig. 1) experimental prototype that is central to PPS. This bridge is a shared resource designed for deployment in proximity to other switching and transcoding resources. It provides a single point of contact for each user so that only one combined video stream is received. This solves the N squared transmission problem of multipoint video conferencing and allows customer premises terminal equipment to be much simpler and less expensive to promote universal video teleconferencing.The AVB is made of a multitude of atomic modules called Video Composing Modules (VCMs) (Fig. 5) which are linked together on an as needed basis to form Video Composing Chains (VCCs) (Fig. 4) of variable length. Each conference participant uses one VCC to customize his or her view of the other participants and conference video objects. Each user has complete and individual control over the appearance and associative connectivity of their video display.The unprecedented degree of control given to each user by the PPS-AVB is due to the nature of the VCM which utilizes the mechanism of pel rate priority multiplexing to give the customer the now familiar paradigm of many overlapping windows that they can move, grow, and shrink at will. The VCM also provides the abilities to temporally subsample or freeze video frames, and to cut out portions of a video scene from the background using rectangular frames and/or keying based upon the color and brightness of objects. The AVB will also be a universal converter of standards and coding schemes so that people with different terminal equipment, having different scan rates and formats and codings can talk to each other without barriers.},

Performance is improved over traditional methods by processing video data in compressed form, avoiding compression and decompression and reducing the amount of data processed. An approximation technique called condensation is developed that further reduces the complexity of the operation. The class of operations that are computable using the techniques developed in this paper are called linear, global digital specials effects (LGDSEs), and represent those effects where a pixel in the output image is a linear combination of pixels in the input image. Many important video processing problems, including convolution, scaling, rotation, translation, and transcoding can be expressed as LGDSEs.},

Many potential users of networked multimedia protocols will continue to have low bandwidth network connections for some time: copper wire ISDN, infra-red, cellular modems, etc.. Compression provides potential relief for users of slow networks by increasing effective bandwidth. Higher Bandwidth X (HBX) introduces a new technique, based on arithmetic coding and statistical modeling, for compressing structured data. Applied to the X networked graphics protocol, this technique yields 6.3:1 compression across a representative set of traces, performing twice as well as the popular LZW-based Xremote compression protocol. HBX's coding techniques are generally applicable to the graphics and imaging subset of multimedia protocols. Future work will determine whether HBX's coding techniques can be applied to audio and video streams as well.},

This system, referred to as content-based browsing, forms an abstraction to represent each shot of the sequence by using a representative frame, or an Rframe, and it includes management techniques to allow the user to easily navigate the Rframes. This methodology is superior to the current techniques of fast forward and rewind because rather than using every frame to view and judge the contents, only a few abstractions are used. Therefore, the need to retrieve the video from a storage system and to transmit every frame over the network in its entirety no longer exists, saving time, expenses, and bandwidth.},

This paper presents some initial guidelines for the design of usable multimedia systems. These guidelines are based on empirical findings regarding the nature of human attention derived from the field of experimental psychology. We believe that the provision of such guidelines for multimedia interface design will support designers in achieving the dual goals of maximising a user's flexibility in controlling the presentation of multiple concurrent media, while keeping cognitive load to an acceptable level.},

Within this general framework, the paper aims at defining a new multimedia synchronization mechanism, the so-called conditional delivery mechanism, which appears particularly useful for achieving both intra- and inter-stream synchronization. Main motivations behind this synchronization mechanism are first discussed on a simple example, namely a distributed application in the area of distance and interactive training, and then the details of the mechanism are presented. This presentation starts with an informal discussion on simple examples, which is followed by a formal specification of the mechanism based on the use of a temporal extension of the Formal Description Technique LOTOS.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach to authoring multimedia documents based on the walk-through paradigm. Using this approach, multimedia authoring tasks can be performed in the context of the multimedia presentation under construction. It greatly simplifies the authoring process by hiding the use of composition constructs and eliminating the turn-around time from the editing and testing parts of the development cycle. End user multimedia authoring and fast prototyping can therefore be realized.},

abstract = {Emerging distributed multimedia applications have stringent performance requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, delay-jitter, and loss rate. The Tenet real-time protocol suite provides the services and mechanisms for delivering such performance guarantees, even during periods of high network load and congestion. The protocols achieve this by using resource management, connection admission control, and appropriate packet service disciplines inside the network. The Sequoia 2000 network employs the Tenet Protocol Suite at each of its hosts and routers making it one of the first wide area packet-switched networks to provide end-to-end per-connection performance guarantees. This paper presents experiments with the Tenet protocols on the Sequoia 2000 network including measurements of the performance of the protocols, the service recieved by real multimedia applications using the protocols, and comparisons with the service received by applications that use the Internet protocols (UDP/IP). We conclude that the Tenet protocols successfully protect the real-time channels from other traffic in the network, including other real-time channels, and allow channels to continue to meet their performance guarantees, even when the network is highly loaded.},

For users with low-end equipment or slow network connections, these protocols provide a degraded but still useful service. We also provide “better than being there” features such as variable playback rates with intelligible audio, and synchronization and linkage of multiple media.Our first prototype gives access to a multimedia database containing talks given at AT&amp;T, with hypermedia links between video, audio and accompanying documents and viewgraphs. Nemesis provides for on-line archival storage and remote viewing of these presentations by members of AT&amp;T R&amp;D community throughout the world. It is integrated with the NCSA Mosaic navigation system as well as the AT&amp;T LINUS information retrieval system. Our goal is to drive the technology and infrastructure to allow communities and large institutions access to multimedia information anytime and anywhere.},

abstract = {Most general content-based image retrieval techniques use colour and texture as main retrieval indices. A recent technique uses colour pairs to model distinct object boundaries for retrieval. These techniques have been applied to overall image contents without taking into account the characteristics of individual objects. While the techniques work well for the retrieval of images with similar overall contents (including backgrounds), their accuracies are limited because they are unable to take advantage of individual object's visual characteristics, and to perform object-level retrieval. This paper looks specifically at the use of colour-pair technique for fuzzy object-level image retrieval. Three extensions are applied to the basic colour-pair technique: (a) the development of a similarity-based ranking formula for colour-pairs matching; (b) the use of segmented objects for object-level retrieval; and (c) the inclusion of perceptually similar colours for fuzzy retrieval. A computer-aided segmentation technique is developed to segment the images' contents. Experimental results indicate that the extensions have led to substantial improvements in the retrieval performance. These extensions are sufficiently general and can be applied to other content-based image retrieval techniques.},

abstract = {The most prominent difference between still images and moving pictures stems from movements and variations. Thus to go from the realm of still image repositories to video databases, we must be able to deal with motion. Particularly, we need the ability to classify objects appearing in a video sequence based on the movements of each object, as well as their other characteristics and features such as shape or color.By describing motion derived from motion analysis, we introduce a dual hierarchy consisting of spatial and temporal parts for video sequence representation. This gives us the flexibility to examine arbitrary frames at various levels of abstraction, and to retrieve the associated temporal information (say, object trajectories) in addition to the spatial representation. Our algorithm for motion detection uses the motion compensation component of the MPEG video encoding scheme. The algorithm then computes trajectories for objects of interest. The specification of a language for retrieval of video based on the spatial as well as motion characteristics is presented.},

This system consists of distributed database servers which store and retrieve data objects of different types of media and in different coding formats. The multimedia document is transmitted over the network as streams through different connections and presented to the user simultaneously. A set of stream synchronization control schemes is designed to control the multiple data streams (either in coded or uncoded format) to achieve multimedia synchronization during progressive presentation. A centralized scheduler derives a stream delivery schedule to compensate variable network delay. The synchronization controller at a user's workstation performs synchronization error recovery by adjusting the presentation schedule according to the temporal requirements in the scenario. Skew tolerance parameters are employed as one of the synchronization requirements. In particular, MPEG-2 coded stream synchronization control is investigated.},

We empirically demonstrate the validity of adapting both packet and bit-rate using a simple feedback mechanism and simple adaptation heuristics to deliver audio and video streams suitable for low-latency, high-fidelity playout.},

abstract = {A serious fairness problem occurs whenever homogeneous, variable bit-rate, video traffic streams are multiplexed at a finite buffer statistical multiplexer. Namely, the cell loss ratio performance varies widely across individual traffic streams. The cause of the problem is the particular random relation of the periodic frame transmission epochs of the video sources that feed the multiplexer. In this paper a protocol is presented which controls the frame transmission epochs, in order to achieve fair distribution of losses among the admitted connections. The protocol operates with the participation of the sources by imposing an additional per-source delay on the traffic entering the network. These additional delays are calculated whenever a connection is accepted or terminated. The overall additional delay imposed by the protocol is guaranteed to be minimal through the use of an appropriate optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed protocol, operating in conjunction with the optimization algorithm, is simulated and evaluated. A basic framework is given for its implementation on an ATM network. Finally, the issues of buffer overhead and the impact of the protocol on the delay experienced at the multiplexer are also discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a technique for segmenting images by texture content with application to indexing images in a large image database. Using quad-tree decomposition, texture features are extracted from spatial blocks at a hierarchy of scales in each image. The quad-tree is grown by iteratively testing conditions for splitting parent blocks based on texture content of children blocks. While this approach does not achieve smooth identification of texture region borders, homogeneous blocks of texture are extracted which can be used in a database index. Furthermore, this technique performs the segmentation directly using image spatial-frequency data. In the segmentation reported here, texture features are extracted from the wavelet representation of the image. This method however, can use other subband decompositions including Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which has been adopted by the JPEG standard for image coding. This makes our segmentation method extremely applicable to databases containing compressed image data. We show application of the texture segmentation towards providing a new method for searching for images in large image databases using “Query-by-texture.”},

abstract = {There is a widespread assumption that the addition of still images, animation and sound to text will enhance any information product. The research reported in this paper is investigating such claims for multimedia in an educational context and for a specific user group: grade-six primary school students. The role of text complexity and text type (descriptive or procedural) in influencing the impact of animation was explored. Design criteria such as the level of semantic integration between text and animation, and the importance of including captions with animations, was also investigated. The initial stages of the research used a commercial CD-ROM multimedia product—Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia—while the later stages have employed multimedia sequences generated for the purposes of the experiments. The findings to date suggest that the impact of multimedia is subtle. Multimedia produced the greatest relative improvement in recall and inference levels in the case of the simple procedural article, but this was also the article which exhibited the greatest integration of text and animation. Experimentation is continuing to establish whether similarly good results can be obtained with a descriptive article when animation integration is improved. Students who have seen only the text are the most successful at recalling what they have read. The addition of animation to a text produces more impact on inference than on recall, and the multimedia group of students scored more highly than the others on inferencing. At a still higher level of comprehension—the ability to identify the main themes in an article or to enact a procedure described in an article—multimedia demonstrated a clear advantage over text alone.},

The project presented concerns the development of a hypermedia system as a teaching aid for colour concepts in the fine arts, although its possible extension to other areas of this subject or even other subjects has been foreseen.This paper describes both an individual software development and an easy-to-use pedagogical methodology based on imaging, digitized video, interactivity, etc., supported by technologically advanced elements, such as the computer, and engineered using object-oriented and knowledge storage technologies, such as hypertext and hypermedia. The project's objectives were to stimulate perception, acquire expertise and skills, promote the application of innovative or creative thought by encouraging fluency, flexibility, originality, inventiveness, production, etc., and to offer an overall view of the importance of colour in art.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new, efficient and practical way to extract lens zoom, camera pan and camera tilt information using modified motion analysis. The proposed method is called the Video Tomography Method (VTM), in which tomographic techniques are introduced into a motion estimation algorithm. By using the VTM, one is able to visualize motion as a spatiotemporal flow for motion analysis. The VTM is an extremely robust [resistant to noise] method for estimating camera operation due to its tomographic nature. The practicality of this type of motion estimation and analysis is confirmed by the results of our simulations and experiments in testing the prototype platform with a low quality video source. Other possible applications that might use extracted motion data are discussed. This method is targeted towards video handling applications that attribute extracted motion data into a video index. It will enhance the process of editing and browsing structured video, and will allow the visualization of scenes spatiotemporally so that video may be accessed intuitively and spatially in relation to its temporal location. This type of access is a new interface for structured video. Scene reconstruction techniques can be extended to apply to the problem of reconstructing occluded images and resolution enhancement.},

Musical beat tracking is needed by various multimedia applications such as video editing, audio editing, and stage lighting control. Previous systems were not able to deal with acoustic signals that contained sounds of various instruments, especially drums. They dealt with either MIDI signals or acoustic signals played on a few instruments, and in the latter case, did not work in real time. Our system deals with popular music in which drums maintain the beat. Because our system examines multiple hypotheses in parallel, it can follow beats without losing track of them, even if some hypotheses become wrong. Our system has been implemented on a parallel computer, the Fujitsu AP1000. In our experiment, the system correctly tracked beats in 27 out of 30 commercially distributed popular songs.},

abstract = {In professional audio, the transition from analog to digital technology is nearly complete. The more recent shift towards systems based on general-purpose computers has been gradual, because such computers lack the processing and I/O performance needed for professional audio applications. The SonicSystem, a professional digital audio system, solves these problems using DSPs and a specialized file system. We describe the uses and implementation of the SonicSystem.A distributed version of the SonicSystem, using FDDI networking, was released in 1992. It provides transparent real-time access to remote sound files, and can handle 100 or more CD-rate channels simultaneously. The system provides guaranteed performance: an activity (such as playing a sound file) is permitted to start only if it can be assured of completing with no dropouts. These properties are achieved by the use of a special-purpose transport protocol, real-time scheduling, and resource reservation.},

abstract = {In a video-on-demand (VOD) system, it is desirable to provide the user with interactive browsing functions such as “fast forward” and “fast backward.” However, these functions usually require a significant amount of additional resources from the VOD system in terms of storage space, retrieval throughput, network bandwidth, etc. Moreover, prevalent video compression techniques such as MPEG impose additional constraints on the process since they introduce inter-frame dependencies. In this paper, we devise methods to support variable rate browsing for MPEG-like video steams and minimize the additional resources required. Specifically, we consider retrieval for a disk-array-based video server and address the problem of distributing the retrieval requests across the disks.Our overall approach for interactive browsing comprises (1) a storage method, (2) placement and sampling methods, and (3) a playout method, where the placement and sampling methods are two alternatives for video segment selection. The segment sampling scheme supports browsing at any desired speed, while minimizing the variation on the number of video segments skipped between samplings. On the other hand, the segment placement scheme supports completely uniform segment sampling across the disk array for some specific speedup rates. Experiments for the visual effect of the proposed segment skipping approach have been conducted on MPEG data. It is shown that the proposed method is a viable approach to video browsing.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of personal computers at homes, businesses, classrooms, libraries, etc. Most often, these systems are used to disseminate information. Recently, multimedia repositories have added to the excitement of this information age by allowing a user to retrieve and manipulate continuous media data types (audio and video objects). The design and implementation of these systems is challenging due to both the large size of objects that constitute this media type and their continuous bandwidth requirement. Compression in combination with the availability of fast CPUs (for real-time decompression) provide effective support for a continuous display of those objects with high bandwidth requirement. Hierarchical storage structures (consisting of RAM, disk and tertiary storage devices) provide a cost-effective solution for the large size of their repositories. The focus of this study is on personal computers (single user, single display) that employ fast CPUs, compression and hierarchical storage structures to support multimedia applications. Its goals are to ensure a continuous display of audio and video objects while minimizing the latency time observed by the user. Its contributions include a novel pipelining mechanism and PIRATE as a technique to manage the disk resident objects.},

Conversation in a realtime collaborative session is recorded linked with a participant's handwritten scripts so that the relevant portion of the conversation can be selectively played back in the subsequent individual session. A participant can preserve informal artifacts and structure the decision-making process by playing back the conversation after the collaboration. The important feature is that a participant can insert meaningful cues in any portion of the conversation without disturbing the current way of collaboration. Through the use of a prototype, we have found the effectiveness and the further improvement of this method.},

abstract = {The goal of the Argo system is to allow medium-sized groups of users to collaborate remotely from their desktops in a way that approaches as closely as possible the effectiveness of face-to-face meetings. In support of this goal, Argo combines high quality multi-party digital video and full-duplex audio with telepointers, shared applications, and whiteboards in a uniform and familiar environment. The shared applications can be unmodified X programs shared via a proxy server, unmodified groupware applications, and applications written using our toolkit. Workers can contact each other as easily as making a phone call, and can easily bring into a conference any material they are working on. They do so by interacting with an object-oriented, client/server conference control system. The same conference control system is used to support teleporting, i.e. moving the desktop environment from one workstation's display to another (for example, from office to home). This paper describes the system we have built to test the hypothesis that the effectiveness of remote collaboration can be substantially impacted by the responsiveness of the interaction media.},

Grammatical rules provide the mechanism for mapping from a representation of the content of a presentation to forms that specify the media objects to be realized. These realization forms include sets of spatial and temporal constraints between elements of the presentation. Individual grammars encapsulate the “look and feel” of a presentation and can be used as generators of that style. By making the grammars sensitive to the requirements of the output medium, parsing can introduce flexibility into the information realization process.},

abstract = {The Personal Presence System (PPS) is an experimental prototype platform to support advanced Broadband applications including multimedia conferencing and distance learning. The PPS supports user presentation control of advanced network elements (multimedia bridges). The multimedia bridges are shared network resources which are designed for deployment in proximity to other switching and transcoding resources. The multimedia bridge provides for a single point of contact for each user so that only one combined video stream is received, thereby minimizing access bandwidth. This architecture solves the N squared transmission problem of multipoint video conferencing and allows customer premises terminal equipment to be much simpler and less expensive than high end desktop workstations. A conventional television with a set-top box may also be used as the terminal equipment for a multiparty multimedia teleconference, enabling universal video teleconferencing.The PPS provides each user with flexible presentation control of a feature-rich video bridge. Each user is able to control and customize the position, magnification and size of the video objects that they choose to receive. During the life time of a PPS session, a user can choose to receive new video objects and change how the objects are presented. In addition to supporting these basic video display capabilities, the PPS also supports advanced features such as object extraction from it's background and multimedia object associations. Multimedia associations allow a user to group together video objects into a meta-object for operations such as scaling, panning, and moving. A user can also control which other users in a session can receive the information that they are providing.This paper is a companion to another paper in this proceedings: “The Personal Presence System—Hardware Architecture” which describes the advanced video bridge experimental prototype hardware that enables this service.},

The installation explores interface issues of 3-D sound and the mapping of conceptual abstractions to physical space.},
