abstract = {In both academia and industry, peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have attracted great attention. Peer-to-peer file sharing applications, such as Napster, Gnutella, Kazaa, BitTorrent, Skype and PPLive, have witnessed tremendous success among end users. And the uses of peer-to-peer network for multimedia streaming, conferencing, gaming, file backup, information retrieval is on the rise. Recent statistics suggests that P2P traffic accounts for as much as 70% of Internet traffic. Unlike a client-server based system, peers bring with them serving capacity. Therefore, as the demand of a peer-to-peer system grows, the capacity of the network grows, too. This enables a peer-to-peer multimedia application to be cheap to build and superb in scalability.The purpose of the tutorial is to examine issues associated with the successful building and deployment of a P2P multimedia application. The technologies discussed can be applied to P2P file sharing, P2P conference, P2P media streaming, P2P VoIP, and P2P storage applications. We start by examining two popular P2P applications, BitTorrent and Skype. The study of the two P2P applications helps us to understand the design principles of P2P applications in general. We then investigate a number of tools for building P2P multimedia applications, such as the overlay network, the scheduling algorithm, the erasure resilient coding, and NAT/firewall traversal. Finally, we move on to critical deployment decisions that make or break the P2P applications, such as P2P economy, security issues in P2P application, peer selection, monitoring and debugging utilities in P2P application.},

abstract = {Real-time multimedia applications today represent the predominant workload in embedded devices ranging from set-top boxes to mobile phones and PDAs. However, implementing and performance tuning of such applications on embedded architectures is a challenging problem. On one hand, such architectures are increasingly becoming complex, with multiple processors, different kinds of memory subsystems and diverse on-chip communication architectures. On the other hand, designers of embedded devices, as well as application developers targeting such devices are faced with stringent performance constraints and time-to-market pressures. This has led to a lot of interest in (i) generic System-on-Chip (SoC) platform or template architectures which can be easily tuned for the application at hand, (ii) techniques for rapidly mapping/developing applications for such architectures, (iii) models and tools for analyzing and performance debugging of such implementations. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this area. It will be helpful to students, researchers, application developers and engineers who have a background in traditional real-time multimedia applications and would like to get an overview of the important issues and solutions pertaining to developing and performance debugging of multimedia applications for embedded SoC platforms.},

abstract = {Contemporary art and engineering research are both at their best when things don't turn out as planned. I'll present selected examples based on artworks developed with students and other collaborators involving robots and networks over the past 20 years. These projects set out to investigate intersections of technology and nature, such as the Telegarden, a robot installation that allowed online participants to remotely tend a living garden; Ballet Mori, a classical dance performed to sounds triggered by live seismic data; and Demonstrate, where an ultra high-resolution video camera raised eyebrows at the 40th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement. Every project led to unexpected twists and complications...I'll also argue that the languages of contemporary art and engineering research are complex, dynamic, and often frustratingly impenetrable to outsiders. In art, a blue disk can be a cliche, or, in the right place at the right time, profound. In engineering, analogous contexts determine the beauty of a coordinate frame or mathematical equation. In both spheres, aesthetic interpretation is based on knowledge of prior art and contemporary dialogues. Being so similar, it is not surprising that unexpected forces arise when these two spheres are brought together.},

abstract = {We present a novel, innovative user interface to music repositories. Given an arbitrary collection of digital music files, our system creates a virtual landscape which allows the user to freely navigate in this collection. This is accomplished by automatically extracting features from the audio signal and training a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) on them to form clusters of similar sounding pieces of music. Subsequently, a Smoothed Data Histogram (SDH) is calculated on the SOM and interpreted as a three-dimensional height profile. This height profile is visualized as a three-dimensional island landscape containing the pieces of music. While moving through the terrain, the closest sounds with respect to the listener's current position can be heard. This is realized by anisotropic auralization using a 5.1 surround sound model. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge extracted automatically from the web to enrich the landscape with semantic information. More precisely, we display words and related images that describe the heard music on the landscape to support the exploration.},

In contrast to the conventional photo slideshow, multiple photos that have similar characteristics are well arranged and displayed at the same layout. Motivated by the concepts of technical writing, each displaying layout is composed of a larger topic photo and several small-size supportive photos. Based on this idea, the proposed tiling slideshow system consists of three major components: image clustering, music analyzer, and layout organizer. Given the limited displaying space, we consider the context and relationship between photos and model the layout organization as a constrainted optimization problem. Experiments on real consumer photograph collections show that the novel displaying method gives users more pleasant browsing experience than the methods that focus only on single photograph display.},

abstract = {We propose a novel and generic video/image reranking algorithm, IB reranking, which reorders results from text-only searches by discovering the salient visual patterns of relevant and irrelevant shots from the approximate relevance provided by text results. The IB reranking method, based on a rigorous Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, finds the optimal clustering of images that preserves the maximal mutual information between the search relevance and the high-dimensional low-level visual features of the images in the text search results. Evaluating the approach on the TRECVID 2003-2005 data sets shows significant improvement upon the text search baseline, with relative increases in average performance of up to 23%. The method requires no image search examples from the user, but is competitive with other state-of-the-art example-based approaches. The method is also highly generic and performs comparably with sophisticated models which are highly tuned for specific classes of queries, such as named-persons. Our experimental analysis has also confirmed the proposed reranking method works well when there exist sufficient recurrent visual patterns in the search results, as often the case in multi-source news videos.},

First, the image manifold is embedded onto a low-dimensional feature space with dual objectives, i.e., maximizing the distances of faraway sample pairs meanwhile preserving the local manifold structure, which essentially results in a Trace Ratio optimization problem. Then an efficient iterative procedure is proposed to directly optimize the trace ratio and finally the clustering process is implemented on the derived low-dimensional embedding. Moreover, the linear approximation is also presented for handling the out-of-sample data. Experimental results show that our algorithm, referred to as Maximum Unfolded Embedding, brings an encouraging improvement in clustering accuracy over the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as K-Means, PCA-Kmeans, normalized cut cite shi00normalized, and Locality Preserving Clustering [13].},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe Fourth Frame Forums, an application that combines traditional four-frame comic strips with online web-based discussion forums. In this application, users are presented with a four-frame comic strip where the last dialogue balloon of the fourth frame is left blank. By typing a statement into this dialogue balloon, the user creates a new discussion thread in the forum, where the user's dialogue choice can be critiqued and discussed by other users of the forum. We argue that Fourth Frame Forums provide an elegant and cost-effective solution for online education and training environments for communities of learners. We provide examples from the domain of US Army leadership development, and compare Fourth Frame Forums to alternative methods of story-directed simulation and training.},

abstract = {This paper investigates two methods of improving the user experience of camera-based interaction. First, problems that arise when avatars are designed to mimic a user's physical actions are presented. Second, a solution is proposed: adding a layer of separation between user and avatar while retaining intuitive user control. Two methods are proposed for this separation: spatially and temporally. Implementations of these methods are then presented in the context of a simple game and evaluate their effect on performance and satisfaction. Results of a human subject experiment are presented, showing that reducing the amount of user control can maintain, and even improve, user satisfaction if the design of such a reduction is appropriate. This is followed by a discussion of how the findings inform camera-based game design.},

In this paper, we consider a different approach to music emotion classification. For each music segment, the approach determines how likely the song segment belongs to an emotion class. Two fuzzy classifiers are adopted to provide the measurement of the emotion strength. The measurement is also found useful for tracking the variation of music emotions in a song.

This paper proposes an approach based on image regularities such as connectivity, parallelism, and orthogonality possessed by the objects with simple user interactions. It is assumed that the objects are piecewise planar. By representing the 3D objects as a shape vector consisting of the normals of the faces of the objects, we impose geometric constraints on this shape vector using the regularities of the objects. We derive a system of equations in terms of the shape vector and the focal length, which we can solve for the shape vector optimally. Experimental results on real images are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},

abstract = {This paper exploits the criteria to optimize the training set construction for video annotation. Most existing learning-based semantic annotation approaches require a large training set to achieve good generalization capacity, in which a considerable amount of labor-intensively manual labeling is desirable. However, it is observed that the generalization capacity of a classifier highly depends on the geometrical distribution rather than the size of the training data. We argue that a training set which includes most temporal and spatial distribution of the whole data will achieve a satisfying performance even in the case of limited size of training set. In order to capture the geometrical distribution characteristics of a given video collection, we propose the following four metrics for constructing an optimal training set, including Salience Time Dispersiveness Spatial Dispersiveness and Diversity. Moreover, based on these metrics, we propose a set of optimization rules to capture the most distribution information of the whole data for a training set with a given size. Experimental results demonstrate that these rules are effective for training set construction for video annotation, and significantly outperform random training set selection as well.},

We review three popular frameworks for salient object detection, i.e., segmentation-based method, grid-based method and part-based method and discuss their advantages and limitations. We argue that using these frameworks individually is generally not enough to handle a large number of salient object classes accurately because of the intrinsic diversity of salient object features. Motivated by this observation, we have proposed a new system which combines the merits of these frameworks into one single hybrid system. The system automatically selects the appropriate modeling method for each individual object class using J measure and shape variance. We conduct comparison experiments on two popular image dataset -- Corel and LabelMe. Empirical results have shown that the proposed hybrid method is more general and can handle much more salient object classes in a robust manner.},

In previous 3D retrieval systems, the user mainly uses two methods to input a query: providing an existing 3D objects, or providing partial shape information of desired objects such as text and 2D shapes. The first method fails when the user does not have a similar 3D object in hand, and the second method cannot sufficiently describe 3D shapes of objects. We believe that the best way is to have a good interface that can convert a 2D sketch drawn by the user into a 3D object as the query. A 2D line drawing is easy to be drawn and is the simplest and most direct way of illustrating a 3D object. In this paper, we develop an interface of 3D object reconstruction from line drawings, which allows the user to draw line drawings of objects with both planar and curved surfaces. In addition, in order to refine the retrieved results, we develop a relevance feedback algorithm based on a novel graph discriminant analysis. Compared with recently published relevance feedback algorithms, our algorithm achieves better retrieval performance.},

For each language of interest, a pair of vector templates is first constructed through a training process. Orientation and category of the query image are then determined based on distances between the query document vector and the constructed vector templates.

This work proposes to use the perceptual importance of the carried video samples to determine which packets shall be transferred with pipeline forwarding - thus receiving deterministic service - and which with a traditional, e.g., best effort or differentiated, service.

Additionally, front projection suffers from shadows and occlusions, making it ill-suited for interactive displays. The GVU-PROCAMS system allows programmers to deploy projectors and displays easily in arbitrary locations by enabling enhanced keystone correction via warping on 3D hardware. In addition, it handles the calibration of multiple projectors using computer vision to produce a redundantly illuminated surface. Redundant illumination offers robustness in the face of occlusions, providing a user with the experience of a rear-projected surface. This paper presents a stand-alone application (WinPVRP) and a programming system (GVU-PROCAMS) that easily allows others to create projected displays with enhanced warping and redundant illumination.},

In the implemented model cluster membership is assigned based on feature vectors extracted from salient ROIs. This paper focuses on the experimental evaluation of the proposed approach for several combinations of feature extraction techniques and unsupervised clustering algorithms. The results reported here show that this is a valid approach and encourage further research.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new color watermarking algorithm that uses the quaternion fourier transform (QFT) to mark the La*b* components of color images is presented. First, we propose an interpretation of the QFT coefficients using the Spatio-Chromatic Fourier analysis, so the effects of any changes to the coefficients can be predicted. Next, watermark casting is performed by modifying the positive and negative coefficients together. The idea is twofold: Robustness is achieved by embedding a color watermark in the coefficient with positive frequency, which spreads it to all components in the spatial domain. On the other hand, invisibility is satisfied by modifying the coefficient with negative frequency, such that the combined effects of the two are insensitive to human eyes.},

abstract = {As wireless connectivity is integrated into many handheld devices, streaming multimedia content among mobile ad-hoc peers is becoming a popular application. In this paper, we introduce a new QoS criterion called path-availability-based service coverage to mobile streaming applications. Based on this QoS criterion, we propose a dynamic service replication strategy for providing guaranteed continuous streaming service to all nodes in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Unlike previous approaches that rely on remaining link duration to determine when service replication should be invoked, in our strategy, a client requests service replication when the path availability between the client and a server instance drops below a certain threshold. This strategy is based on our previous work on continuous link availability, which proves to be helpful in achieving smooth streaming performance in MANETs. Simulation results show that our service replication algorithm can quickly increase the service coverage to 100% while reducing the chance of link breakdowns during service replication.},

In these studies the brushwork is modeled indirectly as part of the annotation of high-level artistic concepts such as the artist name using low-level texture. In this paper, we develop a serial multi-expert framework for explicit annotation of paintings with brushwork classes. In the proposed framework, each individual expert implements transductive inference by exploiting both labeled and unlabelled data. To minimize the problem of noise in the feature space, the experts select appropriate features based on their relevance to the brushwork classes. The selected features are utilized to generate several models to annotate the unlabelled patterns. The experts select the best performing model based on Vapnik combined bound. The transductive annotation using multiple experts out-performs the conventional baseline method in annotating patterns with brushwork classes.},

The threshold between flat and edge is decided empirically and watermark blocks are embedded repeatedly into the image. In the detection process, we show how to estimate the threshold value by ACF(Auto-Correlation Function).

abstract = {As the digital cable TV broadcasting technique is developed, various applications on a digital cable receiver have been required. Particularly, OpenCableTM specifications for digital cable TV broadcasting have presented a cable receiver with multi-tuner for serving a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) application, a Picture-In-Picture (PIP) application, a Picture-Out-Picture (POP) application and etc. But there are some problems for supporting such applications because the existing CableCARDTM device processes conditional access for only one channel at once. Therefore OpenCableTM specifications have introduced the Multi-Stream CableCARDTM device in order to solve the above problems. The Multi-Stream CableCARDTM device can support conditional access processing for 2 or more channels simultaneously. In this paper, we have designed hardware architecture of the Multi-Stream CableCARDTM device. The designed Multi-Stream CableCARDTM device is implemented based on a FPGA which processes multi-channel filtering, MPEG-2 TS filtering, and DVB-Common descrambling and a microprocessor which manages conditional access applications. Especially we have proposed a descrambler design for the high-speed processing in order to support the 200 Mbps input data bandwidth.},

abstract = {Precise automated video search is gaining in importance as the amount of multimedia information is increasing at exponential rates. One of the drawbacks that make video retrieval difficult is the lack of available semantics. In this paper, we propose to supplement the semantic knowledge for retrieval by providing useful semantic clusters derived from event entities present in the news video. These entities include the output from keywords derived from the automated speech recognition (ASR) and event-related High-level Features (HLF) extracted from the news video at the pseudo story level. Fuzzy clustering is then carried out to group similar stories together to form semantic clusters. The retrieval system utilizes these clusters to refine the re-ranking process in the Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) step. Initial experiments performed on video search task using the TRECVID 2005 dataset show that the proposed approach can improve the search performance significantly.},

However, no commercial Web image search engines support RF because of scalability, efficiency and effectiveness issues. In this paper we proposed a scalable relevance feedback mechanism using click-through data for web image retrieval. The proposed mechanism regards users' click-through data as implicit feedback which could be collected at lower cost, in larger quantities and without extra burden on the user. During RF process, both textual feature and visual feature are used in a sequential way. To seamlessly combine textual feature-based RF and visual feature-based RF, a query concept-dependent fusion strategy is automatically learned. Experimental results on a database consisting of nearly three million Web images show that the proposed mechanism is wieldy, scalable and effective.},

Finally we show how the 'glogger program and server architecture create sousveillance communities. Cyborglogger implements features that are ideal for sousveillance such as including continuous capture and real-time upload aimed at communicating personal day-to-day narratives of everyday experiences. The server architecture includes a custom-built community web site that allows a sousveillance community to interact, in real time, with 'glogs from various users of the system. Participants can use their camera phones to display output from other camera phones, resulting in peer-to-peer sharing of visual narratives. This real-time live monitoring creates a social commentary and discourse that runs parallel to the widespread surveillance already present in the world around us. Unlike surveillance, which often happens in secrecy, our tools for sousveillance are freely available and moves personal experience capture into the realm of the everyday, with an open forum for public discourse. We thus explore how users engaging in sousveillance with the 'glogger application provide a balance to existing well-established surveillance practices by examining the philosophical questions that arise from the new artistic practice of sousveillance.},

abstract = {I present a new way of teaching musical tempo and rhythm by writing out the music on a timeline along the ground, with, for example, chalk, in a form in which each beat of the music corresponds to one footstep. In some setups I use computer vision to track participants so that the music is actually generated by their footsteps moving through the space. In other embodiments I installed patio stones, leading to a musical garden, and outfitted each stone with a pressure sensor. I connected the pressure sensors to a central computer, which I programmed to step through a song, as people walk to the garden. Each footstep activates the next note in the song, so that there is perfect synchronization between the music and the speed of your walking (i.e. if you walk faster the song plays faster, if you stop walking the song stops, etc.). In one embodiment the computer controls an outdoor pipe-organ sculpture that I made from PVC pipes. Another provides a MIDI output to control a piano or other sound-producing device. Some versions of the sculpture are human-powered, either electrically, or wholly acoustically without the use of a computer.I also arranged various musical compositions suitable to this new form of art.This teaching method, together with various sculptural embodiments of it were found to break down social barriers and create cross-cultural and cross-generational ties. For example, children and their grand parents enjoyed walking through the gardens at Pine Hill Estates where a version of my sculpture is permanently installed.Other variations of the sculpture include arrays of hydraulophonic fountain jets that play a song in a water park when a person walks on the water. Each note or beat is triggered by a water pressure increase when one of the water jets is blocked by the foot of a user stepping on it.},

abstract = {TV advertising is ubiquitous, perseverant, and economically vital. Millions of people's living and working habits are affected by TV commercials. In this paper, we present a multimodal ("visual + audio + text") commercial video digest scheme to segment individual commercials and carry out semantic content analysis within a detected commercial segment from TV streams.Two challenging issues are addressed. Firstly, we propose a multimodal approach to robustly detect the boundaries of individual commercials. Secondly, we attempt to classify a commercial with respect to advertised products/services. For the first, the boundary detection of individual commercials is reduced to the problem of binary classification of shot boundaries via the mid-level features derived from two concepts: Image Frames Marked with Product Information (FMPI) and Audio Scene Change Indicator (ASCI). Moreover, the accurate individual boundary enables us to perform commercial identification by clip matching via a spatial-temporal signature. For the second, commercial classification is formulated as the task of text categorization by expanding sparse texts from ASR/OCR with external knowledge. Our boundary detection has achieved a good result of F1 = 93.7% on the dataset comprising 499 individual commercials from TRECVID'05 video corpus. Commercial classification has obtained a promising accuracy of 80.9% on 141 distinct ones. Based on these achievements, various applications such as an intelligent digital TV set-top box can be accomplished to enhance the TV viewer's capabilities in monitoring and managing commercials from TV streams.},

Specific to each image category, a text concept is first learned from a set of labeled texts in images of the target category using Multiple Instance Learning [1]. For an image under classification which contains multiple detected text lines, we calculate a weighted Euclidian distance between each text line and the learned text concept of the target category. Subsequently, the minimum distance, along with low-level visual cues, are jointly used as the features for SVM-based classification. Experiments on a challenging image database demonstrate that the proposed fusion framework achieves a higher accuracy than the state-of-art methods for image classification.},

abstract = {Event detection is essential for sports video summarization, indexing and retrieval and extensive research efforts have been devoted to this area. However, the previous approaches are heavily relying on video content itself and require the whole video content for event detection. Due to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level events, it is difficult to come up with a generic framework to achieve a high accuracy of event detection. In addition, the dynamic structures from different sports domains further complicate the analysis and impede the implementation of live event detection systems. In this paper, we present a novel approach for event detection from the live sports game using web-casting text and broadcast video. Web-casting text is a text broadcast source for sports game and can be live captured from the web. Incorporating web-casting text into sports video analysis significantly improves the event detection accuracy. Compared with previous approaches, the proposed approach is able to: (1) detect live event only based on the partial content captured from the web and TV; (2) extract detailed event semantics and detect exact event boundary, which are very difficult or impossible to be handled by previous approaches; and (3) create personalized summary related to certain event, player or team according to user's preference. We present the framework of our approach and details of text analysis, video analysis and text/video alignment. We conducted experiments on both live games and recorded games. The results are encouraging and comparable to the manually detected events. We also give scenarios to illustrate how to apply the proposed solution to professional and consumer services.},

abstract = {As small portable devices are becoming standard personal equipments, there is a great need for the adaptation of information content to small displays. Currently, no good solutions exist for viewing formatted documents, such as pdf documents, on these devices. Adapting content of web pages to small displays is usually achieved by complete redesign of a page or automatically reflowing text for small displays. Such techniques may not be applicable to documents whose format needs to be preserved. To address this problem, we propose a new document representation called Multimedia Thumbnail. Multimedia Thumbnail uses the visual and audio channels of small portable devices to communicate document information in form of a multimedia clip, which can be seen as a movie trailer for a document. Generation of such a clip includes a document analysis step, where salient document information is extracted, an optimization step, where the document information to be included in the thumbnail is determined based on display and time constraints, and a synthesis step, where visual and audible information are formed into a playable Multimedia Thumbnail. We also present user study results that evaluate an initial system design and point to further modification on analysis, optimization, and user interface components.},

abstract = {When a video is displayed on a smaller display than originally intended, some of the information in the video is necessarily lost. In this paper, we introduce Video Retargeting that adapts video to better suit the target display, minimizing the important information lost. We define a framework that measures the preservation of the source material, and methods for estimating the important information in the video. Video retargeting crops each frame and scales it to fit the target display. An optimization process minimizes information loss by balancing the loss of detail due to scaling with the loss of content and composition due to cropping. The cropping window can be moved during a shot to introduce virtual pans and cuts, subject to constraints that ensure cinematic plausibility. We demonstrate results of adapting a variety of source videos to small display sizes.},

abstract = {Recently, interactive image cutout technique becomes prevalent for image segmentation problem due to its easy-to-use nature. However, most existing stroke-based interactive object cutout system did not consider the user intention inherent in the user interaction process. Strokes in sequential steps are treated as a collection rather than a process, and only the color information of the additional stroke is used to update the color model in the graph cut framework. Accordingly, unexpected fluctuation effect may occur during the process of interactive object cutout. In fact, each step of user interaction reflects the user's evaluation of previous result and his/her intention. By analyzing the user's intention behind the interaction, we propose a progressive cut algorithm, which explicitly models the user's intention into a graph cut framework for the object cutout task. Three aspects of user intention are utilized: 1) the color of the stroke indicates the kind of change s/he expects, 2) the location of the stroke indicates the region of interest, 3) the relative position between the stroke and the previous result indicates the segmentation error. By incorporating such information into the cutout system, the new algorithm removes the unexpected fluctuation effect of existing stroke-based graph-cut methods, and thus provides the user a more controllable result with fewer strokes and faster visual feedback. Experiments and user study show the strength of progressive cut in accuracy, speed, controllability, and user experience.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of technology and the processing aspects of some contemporary art forms make maintenance and re-fruition of a number of past masterpieces a difficult task. This is especially true of multimedia installations, with multiple audio and video sources coordinated through some control device, which also accounts for user interaction issues. So, it is not inappropriate to speak of "archeology of multimedia" in the case of the remise-en-oeuvre of an installation. This paper describes a complete example of archeology of multimedia. In particular, the art exhibit is the reprise of the first truly multimedia show of the electronic era: Le Corbusier's Po\^{e}me \'{e}lectronique, displayed at the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958. The show, conceived for the Philips Pavilion and consisting of a black&amp;white video, color light ambiances, music moving over sound routes, visual special effects, has never been reprised after the end of the exhibition. The Po\^{e}me \'{e}lectronique has been entirely reconstructed after a philological investigation through image archives, project sketches and technical documentation from Philips and then delivered in two virtual reality settings. Moreover, two aspects of the project are worth being abstracted from the design and realization of this specific reconstruction and contribute to the design, pre-visualization and fruition of novel contemporary artworks: a language for the description of the control score and an architecture design for the integration of several media sources. The language and the architecture, with a sketch of a friendly interface, are illustrated at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {Salient points are locations in an image where there is a significant variation with respect to a chosen image feature. Since the set of salient points in an image capture important local characteristics of that image, they can form the basis of a good image representation for content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The features for a salient point should represent the local characteristic of that point so that the similarity between features indicates the similarity between the salient points. Traditional uses of salient points for CBIR assign features to a salient point based on the image features of all pixels in a window around that point. However, since salient points are often on the boundary of objects, the features assigned to a salient point often involve pixels from different objects. In this paper, we propose a CBIR system that uses a novel salient point method that both reduces the number of salient points using a segmentation as a filter, and also improves the representation so that it is a more faithful representation of a single object (or portion of an object) that includes information about its surroundings. We also introduce an improved Expectation Maximization-Diverse Density (EM-DD) based multiple-instance learning algorithm. Experimental results show that our CBIR techniques improve retrieval performance by 5%-11% as compared with current methods.},

abstract = {Age Specific Human-Computer Interaction (ASHCI) has vast potential applications in daily life. However, automatic age estimation technique is still underdeveloped. One of the main reasons is that the aging effects on human faces present several unique characteristics which make age estimation a challenging task that requires non-standard classification approaches. According to the speciality of the facial aging effects, this paper proposes the AGES (AGing pattErn Subspace) method for automatic age estimation. The basic idea is to model the aging pattern, which is defined as a sequence of personal aging face images, by learning a representative subspace. The proper aging pattern for an unseen face image is then determined by the projection in the subspace that can best reconstruct the face image, while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will indicate its age. The AGES method has shown encouraging performance in the comparative experiments either as an age estimator or as an age range estimator.},

In this paper, we address the twin problems of efficient retrieval of the approximate set of instances (a) farthest from and (b) nearest to a query hyperplane. Retrieval of instances for this hyperplane-based query scenario is mapped to the range-query problem allowing for the reuse of existing index structures. Empirical evaluation on large image datasets confirms the effectiveness of our approach.},

Most previous periodic broadcast protocols, however, assume that all clients can receive at the same rate, and also assume that available bandwidth is not time-varying. In this paper, we first develop a new periodic broadcast protocol, Optimized Heterogeneous Periodic Broadcast (OHPB), that can be optimized for a given population of clients with heterogeneous reception bandwidths and quality-of-service requirements. The OHPB protocol utilizes an optimized segment size progression determined by solving a linear optimization model that takes as input the client population characteristics and an objective function such as mean client startup delay. We then propose complementary client protocols employing work-ahead buffering of data during playback, so as to enable more uniform playback quality when the available bandwidth is time-varying.},

The first solution simply combines existing resource sharing techniques and deals with clients as two bandwidth classes. The other two solutions, however, classify clients into multiple bandwidth classes and service them accordingly by capturing the proposed ideas of Adaptive Stream Merging or Enhanced Adaptive Stream Merging, respectively. We also discuss how scheduling policies can be adapted to the heterogeneous environment so as to exploit the variations in client bandwidth.

abstract = {Streaming of linear media objects, such as audio and video, has become ubiquitous on today's Internet. Large groups of users regularly tune in to a wide variety of online programming, including radio shows, sports events, and news coverage. However, non-linear media objects, such as large 3D computer graphics models and visualization databases, have proven more difficult to stream due to their interactive nature. This paper presents Channel Set Adaptation (CSA), a framework that allows for the efficient streaming of non-linear datasets to large user groups. CSA allows individual clients to request custom data flows for interactive applications using standard broadcast or multicast join and leave operations. CSA scales to support very large user groups while continuing to provide interactive data access to independently operating clients. We discuss a motivating sample application for digital museums and present results from an experimental evaluation of CSA's performance.},

To solve the ranking problem when aggregating multiple photo forums, we propose a novel rank fusion algorithm that uses duplicate photos to normalize rating scores. To further improve user experiences in enjoying photos, we design an in-place image browsing interface, and compare it with several other interfaces in a user study. With rich metadata and rating information, more attractive user interfaces are enabled, including slideshow authoring and photo recommendations. We conducted experiments and user studies on a 2.5-million image database to evaluate the proposed rank fusion algorithm, investigate the rationale behind building a vertical image search engine, and study user interfaces and preferences for the purpose of enjoying high-quality photos. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking algorithm. The results also show that the 2.5-million high-quality image database in EnjoyPhoto performs comparably with Google's 1- billion image database for queries related to location, nature, and daily life categories. Finally, our results show that the in-place browsing interface-called Force-Transfer view-is much more convenient for users than traditional interfaces.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose, IGroup, an efficient and effective algorithm that organizes Web image search results into clusters. IGroup is different from all existing Web image search results clustering algorithms that only cluster the top few images using visual or textual features. Our proposed algorithm first identifies several query-related semantic clusters based on a key phrases extraction algorithm originally proposed for clustering general Web search results. Then, all the resulting images are separated and assigned to corresponding clusters. As a result, all the resulting images are organized into a clustering structure with semantic level. To make the best use of the clustering results, a new user interface (UI) is proposed. Different from existing Web image search interfaces, which show only a limited number of suggested query terms or representative image thumbnails of some clusters, the proposed interface displays both representative thumbnails and appropriate titles of semantically coherent image clusters. Comprehensive user studies have been completed to evaluate both the clustering algorithm and the new UI.},

The system exploits the human capability for rapidly scanning imagery augmenting it with an active learning loop, which attempts to always present the most relevant material based on the current information. Two versions of the human interface were evaluated, one with variable page sizes and manual paging, the other with a fixed page size and automatic paging. Both require absolute attention and focus of the user for optimal performance. In either case, as users search and find relevant results, the system can invisibly re-rank its previous best guesses using a number of knowledge sources, such as image similarity, text similarity, and temporal proximity. Experimental evidence shows a significant improvement using the combined extremes of human and machine power over either approach alone.},

abstract = {Newly emerging game--based application systems such as Second Life1 provide 3D virtual environments where multiple users interact with each other in real--time. They are filled with autonomous, mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users. To make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible, they are usually built on a client--server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub--worlds. In each sub--world, the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint, rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium. In such systems, the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user's viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability. Specifically, performing real--time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub-millions of active users are moving and interacting. We recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi-dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query. Unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments.The main goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable real--time visibility determination. We then uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality, system throughput, and resource utilization. We expect our approach to lay the groundwork for next--generation virtual frameworks that may merge into existing web--based services in the near future.},

abstract = {Music similarity query based on acoustic content is becoming important with the ever-increasing growth of the music information from emerging applications such as digital libraries and WWW. However, relative techniques are still in their infancy and much less than satisfactory. In this paper, we present a novel index structure, called Composite Feature tree, CF-tree, to facilitate efficient content-based music search adopting multiple musical features. Before constructing the tree structure, we use PCA to transform the extracted features into a new space sorted by the importance of acoustic features. The CF-tree is a balanced multi-way tree structure where each level represents the data space at different dimensionalities. The PCA transformed data and reduced dimensions in the upper levels can alleviate suffering from dimensionality curse. To accurately mimic human perception, an extension, named CF+-tree, is proposed, which further applies multivariable regression to determine the weight of each individual feature. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed structures against state-of-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of our technique.},

abstract = {We introduce the challenge problem for generic video indexing to gain insight in intermediate steps that affect performance of multimedia analysis methods, while at the same time fostering repeatability of experiments. To arrive at a challenge problem, we provide a general scheme for the systematic examination of automated concept detection methods, by decomposing the generic video indexing problem into 2 unimodal analysis experiments, 2 multimodal analysis experiments, and 1 combined analysis experiment. For each experiment, we evaluate generic video indexing performance on 85 hours of international broadcast news data, from the TRECVID 2005/2006 benchmark, using a lexicon of 101 semantic concepts. By establishing a minimum performance on each experiment, the challenge problem allows for component-based optimization of the generic indexing issue, while simultaneously offering other researchers a reference for comparison during indexing methodology development. To stimulate further investigations in intermediate analysis steps that inuence video indexing performance, the challenge offers to the research community a manually annotated concept lexicon, pre-computed low-level multimedia features, trained classifier models, and five experiments together with baseline performance, which are all available at http://www.mediamill.nl/challenge/.},

In this paper, we present a novel method to recognize the basic player actions in broadcast tennis video. Different from the existing appearance-based approaches, our method is based on motion analysis and considers the relationship between the movements of different body parts and the regions in the image plane. A novel motion descriptor is proposed and supervised learning is employed to train the action classifier. We also propose a novel framework by combining the player action recognition with other multimodal features for semantic and tactic analysis of the broadcast tennis video. Incorporating action recognition into the framework not only improves the semantic indexing and retrieval performance of the video content, but also conducts highlights ranking and tactics analysis in tennis matches, which is the first solution to our knowledge for tennis game. The experimental results demonstrate that our player action recognition method outperforms existing appearance-based approaches and the multimodal framework is effective for broadcast tennis video analysis.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to learn concepts from large scale imbalanced data sets. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the effects of large scale and imbalance on SVMs. We highlight the role of linear non-separability in this problem. Secondly, we develop a both practical and theoretical guaranteed meta-algorithm to handle the trouble of scale and imbalance. The approach is named Support Cluster Machines (SCMs). It incorporates the informative and the representative under-sampling mechanisms to speedup the training procedure. The SCMs differs from the previous similar ideas in two ways, (a) the theoretical foundation has been provided, and (b) the clustering is performed in the feature space rather than in the input space. The theoretical analysis not only provides justification, but also guides the technical choices of the proposed approach. Finally, experiments on both the synthetic and the TRECVID data are carried out. The results support the previous analysis and show that the SCMs are efficient and effective while dealing with large scale imbalanced data sets.},

abstract = {We used human movement as the basis for designing a collaborative aesthetic design environment. Our intention was to promote social interaction and creative expression. We employed off-the-shelf computer vision technology. Movement became the basis for the choreography of gestures, the development of gesture recognition, and the development of imagery and visualization. We discovered that the design of clear affordances is no less important in movement-based than in mouse-based systems. Through an integrated and iterative design process, we developed a new type of affordance, the choreographic button, which integrates choreography, gesture recognition, and visual feedback. Jumping, a quick movement, and crouching, a sustained gesture, were choreographed to form a vocabulary that is personally expressive, and which also facilitates automatic recognition.How can we evaluate socially motivated interactive systems? To create a context for evaluation, we held an integrated exhibition, party, and user study event. This mixing of events produced an engaging environment in which participants could choose to interact with each other, as well as with the design environment. We prepared a mouse-based version of the design environment, and compared how people experienced it with the movementbased system. Our study demonstrates that movement-based affordances promote social interaction.},

Video systems are an attractive mechanism to provide interaction with artwork. However, public spaces are complex environments for video analysis systems. Interaction becomes even more difficult when the art is viewed by large groups of people. We describe a video system for interaction with art in public spaces and with large audiences using a model-free, appearance-based approach. Our system extracts parameters that describe the field of motion seen by a camera, and then imposes structure on the scene by introducing a swarm of particles that moves in reaction to the motion field. Constraints placed on the particle movement impose further structure on the motion field. The artistic display reacts to the particles in a manner that is interesting and predictable for participants. We demonstrate our video interaction system with a series of interactive art installations tested with the assistance of a volunteer audience.},

abstract = {The "Tools for Automatic Generation of Learning Object Metadata" project addresses the requirement of developing advanced distributed learning delivery architecture and services for a large US government agency. We have developed a Webbased system called MAGIC (Metadata Automated Generation for Instructional Content) to assist content authors and course developers in generating metadata for learning objects and information assets to enable wider reuse of these objects across departments and organizations. Using the MAGIC system, content authors review and edit automatically-generated metadata sufficient to register and describe their assets for use and discovery in current and future distributed learning applications complying with the ADL SCORM standard. Course developers can use the system to assist in the conversion of existing courses to SCORM format or in developing new SCORM courses. The MAGIC system includes software tools to analyze and extract descriptive metadata from instructional videos, training documents, and other information assets. The tools generate some of the most critical SCORM metadata completely automatically. Benefits of MAGIC include easier reuse and repurposing, improved interoperability, and more timely registration of content for use by course developers. In this paper, we describe the system architecture, analysis tools developed, and services supported. A live demonstration of the system illustrating several use cases of the system will be presented at the conference, with a discussion of results from user studies and evaluation of the system.},

abstract = {We present a musical keyboard that is not only velocity-sensitive, but in fact responds to absement (presement), displacement (placement), velocity, acceleration, jerk, jounce, etc. (i.e. to all the derivatives, as well as the integral, of displacement).Moreover, unlike a piano keyboard in which the keys reach a point of maximal displacement, our keys are essentially infinite in length, and thus never reach an end to their key travel. Our infinite length keys are achieved by using water jet streams that continue to flow past the fingers of a person playing the instrument. The instrument takes the form of a pipe with a row of holes, in which water flows out of each hole, while a user is invited to play the instrument by interfering with the flow of water coming out of the holes. The instrument resembles a large flute, but, unlike a flute, there is no complicated fingering pattern. Instead, each hole (each water jet) corresponds to one note (as with a piano or pipe organ). Therefore, unlike a flute, chords can be played by blocking more than one water jet hole at the same time. Because each note corresponds to only one hole, different fingers of the musician can be inserted into, onto, around, or near several of the instrument's many water jet holes, in a variety of different ways, resulting in an ability to independently control the way in which each note in a chord sounds.Thus the hydraulophone combines the intricate embouchure control of woodwind instruments with the polyphony of keyboard instruments.Various forms of our instrument include totally acoustic, totally electronic, as well as hybrid instruments that are acoustic but also include an interface to a multimedia computer to produce a mixture of sounds that are produced by the acoustic properties of water screeching through orific plates, as well as synthesized sounds.},

abstract = {Many recent studies perform annotation of paintings based on brushwork. They model the brushwork indirectly as part of annotation of high-level artistic concepts such as artist name using low-level texture features and supervised inference methods. In this paper, we develop a framework for explicit annotation of paintings with brushwork classes. Brushwork classes serve as meta-level semantic concepts for artist names, paintings styles and periods of art and facilitate the incorporation of domain-specific ontologies. In particular, we employ the serial multi-expert framework with semi-supervised clustering methods to perform the annotation of brushwork patterns. Serial combination of multiple experts facilitates step-wise refinement of decisions based on the preferences of individual experts. Each individual expert performs focused subtasks using relevant feature set, which decreases the 'curse of dimensionality' and noise in the feature space. Each expert focuses on the annotation of the currently available samples from its unlabeled pool using semi-supervised agglomerative clustering. This approach is more appropriate as compared to the traditional classification methods since each brushwork class includes a variety of patterns and cannot be represented as a single distribution in the feature space. The experts exploit the distribution of unlabelled patterns and further minimize the annotation error. The multi-expert semi-supervised framework out-performs the conventional methods in annotation of patterns with brushwork classes. This framework will further be adopted to facilitate ontology-based annotation with higher-level semantic concepts such as the artist names, painting styles and periods of art.},

abstract = {It is well-known that live multimedia streaming applications operate more efficiently when organized in peer-to-peer (P2P) topologies, since peer upload capacities are utilized to support other peers, and to alleviate the load and operating costs on the streaming servers. To date, there have been a number of existing experimental proposals with respect to how such peer-to-peer topologies are organized to support live streaming sessions. However, most of the existing proposals resort to intuition and heuristics when it comes to the design of such topology construction (i.e., neighbor selection) protocols. In this paper, we investigate the scaling laws of live P2P multimedia streaming, by quantitatively studying the asymptotic effects and tradeoffs among three key parameters in P2P streaming: server bandwidth cost, the maximum number of peers that can be supported, and the maximum number of streaming hops experienced by a peer. To further generalize our studies, we do not make restrictive assumptions in our theoretical analysis of such scaling laws: both peer upload capacities and peer lifetimes in a session may come from arbitrary distributions. With the theoretical insights we have developed, we propose Affinity, a simple and realistic heuristic to demonstrate the key benefits of our theoretical analysis in dynamic P2P networks, as compared to the topology construction algorithms in existing work.},

abstract = {Fundamental challenges in designing environments with media-rich ambient services involves not only the development of appropriate sensing technologies, but as importantly, the implementation of a distributed media processing system which can process, integrate, and leverage the sensed data in real time to provide the various services. In recent years, a great deal of progress has been made in media service workflow processing systems. In most existing solutions, however, the workflow nodes, which operate on the data, are selected out of a centrally assigned candidate pool. These candidate organizations cause either extensive resource provisioning or poor-quality operator mapping between logical workflow nodes and the available physical resources nodes. Consequently, instantiating a media processing workflow to the underlying hardware before the workflow execution begins does not lends itself to adaptive and autonomous operation of the workflow, scalable to resources and demand.In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized multimedia workflow processing system, DANS, in which operators defined in workflows are mapped into (distributed) physical nodes through Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based overlay substrate in a purely decentralized and adaptive manner. The redundancy in the system, in terms of availability of multiple nodes able to perform the same task, enables the system to scale with demand. Furthermore, physical workflow nodes (operator instances) are able to locate and select the next filter or fusion operator instance autonomously, while ensuring the correct execution of the workflow.},

abstract = {Many emerging applications such as video sensor monitoring can benefit from an on-line video correlation system, which can be used to discover linkages between different video streams in realtime. However, on-line video correlations are often resource-intensive where a single host can be easily overloaded. We present a novel adaptive distributed on-line video correlation system called ViCo. Unlike single stream processing, correlations between different video streams require a distributed execution system to observe a new correlation constraint that any two correlated data must be distributed to the same host. ViCo achieves three unique features: (1) correlation-awareness that ViCo can guarantee the correlation accuracy while spreading excessive workload on multiple hosts; (2) adaptability that the system can adjust algorithm behaviors and switch between different algorithms to adapt to dynamic stream environments; and (3) fine-granularity that the workload of one resource-intensive correlation request can be divided and distributed among multiple hosts. We have implemented and deployed a prototype of ViCo on a commercial cluster system. Our experiment results using both real videos and synthetic workloads show that ViCo outperforms existing techniques for scaling-up the performance of video correlations.},

abstract = {While content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is an expanding field, and new approaches to ever more effective retrieval are frequently proposed, relatively little attention has so far been paid to the process of evaluating the effectiveness of CBIR methods. Most of the reported evaluations use standard IR evaluation methodologies, with little consideration of their statistical significance or appropriateness for CBIR, which makes it difficult to assess the precise impact of individual methods. In this paper, we present a new approach for evaluating CBIR systems which provides both efficient and statistically-sound performance evaluation. The approach is based on stratified sampling, and provides a significant improvement over existing evaluation approaches. Comprehensive experiments using our approach to evaluate a range of CBIR methods have shown that the approach reduces not only the estimation error, but also reduces the size of the test data set required to achieve specific estimation error levels.},

abstract = {Conventional wide-area video surveillance systems use a network of fixed cameras positioned close to locations of interest. We describe an alternative and flexible approach to wide area surveillance based on observation streams collected from mobile cameras mounted on buses. We allow a "virtual observer" to be placed anywhere within the space covered by the sensor network, and reconstruct the scene at these arbitrary points. Use of such imagery is challenging because mobile cameras have variable position and orientation, and sample a large spatial area but at low temporal resolution. Additionally, the views of any particular place are distributed across many different video streams. Addressing this problem, we present a system in which views from an arbitrary perspective can be constructed by indexing, organising, and transforming images collected from multiple streams acquired from a network of mobile cameras. Our system supports retrieval of raw images based on constraints of space, time, and geometry (eg. visibility of landmarks). It also allows the synthesis of wide-angle panoramic views in situations where the camera motion produces suitable sampling of the scene and metaphors for query and presentation that overcome the complexity of the data.},

abstract = {Computer vision researchers have recently proposed several local descriptor schemes. Due to lack of database support, however, these descriptors have only been evaluated using small image collections. Recently, we have developed the PvS-framework, which allows efficient querying of large local descriptor collections. In this paper, we use the PvSframework to study the scalability of local image descriptors. We propose a new local descriptor scheme and compare it to three other well known schemes. Using a collection of almost thirty thousand images, we show that the new scheme gives the best results in almost all cases. We then give two stop rules to reduce query processing time and show that in many cases only a few query descriptors must be processed to find matching images. Finally, we test our descriptors on a collection of over three hundred thousand images, resulting in over 200 million local descriptors, and show that even at such a large scale the results are still of high quality, with no change in query processing time.},

Instead of using frame-based or salient-based features to measure the acoustical similarity of audio clips, segment-based similarity is proposed. The novelty of our approach lies in two aspects: segment-based representation, and the similarity measure and ranking based on four kinds of similarity factors. In segmentbased representation, segments not only capture the change property of audio clip, but also keep and present the change relation and temporal order of audio features. In the similarity measure and ranking, four kinds of similarity factors: acoustical, granularity, temporal order and interference are progressively and jointly measured by optimal matching and dynamic programming, which guarantee the comprehensive and sufficient similarity measure between two audio clips. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach is better than some existing methods in terms of retrieval and ranking capabilities.},

abstract = {Image annotation has been an active research topic in recent years due to its potentially large impact on both image understanding and Web image search. In this paper, we target at solving the automatic image annotation problem in a novel search and mining framework. Given an uncaptioned image, first in the search stage, we perform content-based image retrieval (CBIR) facilitated by high-dimensional indexing to find a set of visually similar images from a large-scale image database. The database consists of images crawled from the World Wide Web with rich annotations, e.g. titles and surrounding text. Then in the mining stage, a search result clustering technique is utilized to find most representative keywords from the annotations of the retrieved image subset. These keywords, after salience ranking, are finally used to annotate the uncaptioned image. Based on search technologies, this framework does not impose an explicit training stage, but efficiently leverages large-scale and well-annotated images, and is potentially capable of dealing with unlimited vocabulary. Based on 2.4 million real Web images, comprehensive evaluation of image annotation on Corel and U. Washington image databases show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

We divide all the camera parameters determining a camera matrix into two categories: clip-varying and frame-varying. For the clip-varying ones, we use a clip-wise data analysis procedure to achieve their accuracy. For the framevarying ones, we use a Hough-like search to tune them for each frame. Preliminary experiments results show that we can seamlessly insert projected virtual content into each frame.},

A novel manifold-ranking based scheme is proposed, which consists of three major components: feature pool construction, pre-filtering, and manifold-ranking. First, as there are large variations in the effective features for different concepts, a large feature pool is constructed, from which the most effective features can be selected automatically or semi-automatically. Second, to tackle the issue of large computation cost for successive manifold-ranking process when large video database is incorporated, we employ a pre-filtering process to filter out the majority of irrelevant samples while retaining the most relevant ones. And last, the manifold-ranking algorithm is used to explore the relationship among all of the rest samples based on the selected features. This scheme is extensible and flexible in terms of adding new features into the feature pool, introducing human interactions on selecting features, and defining new concepts.},

abstract = {Most existing web video search engines index videos by file names, URLs, and surrounding texts. These types of video metadata roughly describe the whole video in an abstract level without taking the rich content, such as semantic content descriptions and speech within the video, into consideration. Therefore the relevance ranking of the video search results is not satisfactory as the details of video contents are ignored. In this paper we propose a novel relevance ranking approach for Web-based video search using both video metadata and the rich content contained in the videos. To leverage real content into ranking, the videos are segmented into shots, which are smaller and more semantic-meaningful retrievable units, and then more detailed information of video content such as semantic descriptions and speech of each shots are used to improve the retrieval and ranking performance. With video metadata and content information of shots, we developed an integrated ranking approach, which achieves improved ranking performance. We also introduce machine learning into the ranking system, and compare them with IR-model (information retrieval model) based method. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for the automatic generation of animation movie trailers. First, the movie is divided into shots, by detecting the video transitions (cuts, fades and dissolves) and an animation movie specific color effect named short color change or SCC (i.e. explosions, thunders). The movie action content is further highlighted by analyzing the movie at two different granularity levels. First, an inter-shot analysis is performed by measuring the video transition temporal distribution. As repetitive shot changes are related to action, we define as an action shot, a movie segment containing a high shot change ratio. On the other hand, an inter-frame analysis is performed: for each shot within an action shot, an histogram of cumulative inter-frame distances is computed to serve as a measure of the frame spatial activity. Repetitive color changes are also related to action. Since movie trailers only show some of the most attractive movie scenes, the proposed trailer is a moving-image abstract computed on the retained action shots. It provides the user with a compact and efficient representation of the movie action content. The proposed approach was tested on several animation movies.},

Our approach has three contributions: firstly, we build the statistical representation of normal behaviors in the database using nonparametric kernel density estimation; secondly, local feature descriptors are highly compressed using PCA and stored in a K-D tree structure, making the search for behavior-based similarity fast and effective; thirdly, the K-D trees are used to generate multiple hypotheses which compete for the optimal classification. The approach requires no tracking, no explicit motion estimation, and no predefined class-based templates. Experimental results have validated our approach in many real-world video sequences.},

abstract = {Image annotation plays an important role in image retrieval and management. However, the results of the state-of-the-art image annotation methods are often unsatisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to refine the imprecise annotations obtained by existing annotation methods. In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the original annotations of images is proposed. On the one hand, for Web images, textual information, e.g. file name and surrounding text, is used to retrieve a set of candidate annotations. On the other hand, for non-Web images that are lack of textual information, a relevance model-based algorithm using visual information is used to decide the candidate annotations. Then, candidate annotations are re-ranked and only the top ones are reserved as the final annotations. To re-rank the annotations, an algorithm using Random Walk with Restarts (RWR) is proposed to leverage both the corpus information and the original confidence information of the annotations. Experimental results on both non-Web images of Corel dataset and Web images of photo forum sites demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Navigation through large multimedia collections that include videos and images still remains cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to visualize and navigate through the collection by creating a mosaic image that visually represents the compilation. This image is generated by a labeling-based layout algorithm using various sizes of sample tile images from the collection. Each tile represents both the photographs and video files representing scenes selected by matching algorithms. This generated mosaic image provides a new way for thematic video and visually summarizes the videos. Users can generate these mosaics with some predefined themes and layouts, or base it on the results of their queries. Our approach supports automatic generation of these layouts by using meta-information such as color, time-line and existence of faces or manually generated annotated information from existing systems (e.g., the Family Video Archive).},

abstract = {In soccer videos, most significant actions are usually followed by close--up shots of players that take part in the action itself. Automatically annotating the identity of the players present in these shots would be considerably valuable for indexing and retrieval applications. Due to high variations in pose and illumination across shots however, current face recognition methods are not suitable for this task. We show how the inherent multiple media structure of soccer videos can be exploited to understand the players' identity without relying on direct face recognition. The proposed method is based on a combination of interest point detector to "read" textual cues that allow to label a player with its name, such as the number depicted on its jersey, or the superimposed text caption showing its name. Players not identified by this process are then assigned to one of the labeled faces by means of a face similarity measure, again based on the appearance of local salient patches. We present results obtained from soccer videos taken from various recent games between national teams.},

The generation and management of sub-pixels are a very serious problem in high-definition H.264 video encoding. Since the amount of sub-pixels in H.264 encoding is about 16 times larger than that of integer pixels, H.264 encoder needs very high speed memory access for realtime encoding of high-definition video. In order to avoid the sub-pixel problem, we estimate the distortion value for a motion estimation of sub-pixel resolution by using the nonlinear combination of the distortion value derived from a motion estimation of related integer pixel, based on the proposed differential structure. Simulation results show that the proposed mathematical properties are valid by the sub-pixel motion estimation based on the proposed mathematical analysis. It also shows that the proposed sub-pixel motion estimation is so effective that the encoding speed is dramatically increased without a considerable depression of video quality.},

Then, machine learning of SVR (Support Vector Regression) is carried out to learn the mapping model in principal component space. With the mapping model, in application phase, users just need to input a frontal facial photograph for the caricature generation. The caricature is exaggerated based on the original face while reserving essential similar features. Experiments proved comparatively that our approach could generate more harmonious caricatures.},

abstract = {Providing mobile devices with virtual environment walkthrough and real-time streaming movie playback capability is expected to have a profound impact to the entertainment-based applications, such as virtual guides, online gaming, and e-learning, just to name a few. However, it is well known that it is extremely difficult to render complex 3D scenes at interactive frame rates on thin mobile devices known for their lack of proper resources needed to process large volume of 3D virtual environment data. In order to provide virtual environment navigation on thin mobile clients, we propose a hybrid technique which combines both remote geometry rendering and streaming of warped images. In our approach, the server renders a partial panoramic view, which is based on the user's viewpoint and last movements. The server then warps the image's coordinates into cylindrical coordinates, and streams the images to the client device, which will progressively build the panoramic representation of the scene. Furthermore, in order to enhance streaming performance and quality of the interaction, we propose to use a rate control mechanism as well as a prediction of the user's movements within the virtual scene. In this paper we discuss our scheme for remote rendering and streaming of progressive panoramas for mobile devices, and present our experimental results we have obtained in order to validate our proposed technique. Our results indicate clearly that the proposed solution is able to achieve stable frame rates and throughput in error-prone wireless channels.},

abstract = {Digital video is sequential in nature. When video data is used in a semantic concept classification task, the episodes are usually summarized with shots. The shots are annotated as containing, or not containing, a certain concept resulting in a labeled dataset. These labeled shots can subsequently be used by supervised learning methods (classifiers) where they are trained to predict the absence or presence of the concept in unseen shots and episodes. The performance of such automatic classification systems is usually estimated with cross-validation. By taking random samples from the dataset for training and testing as such, part of the shots from an episode are in the training set and another part from the same episode is in the test set. Accordingly, data dependence between training and test set is introduced, resulting in too optimistic performance estimates. In this paper, we experimentally show this bias, and propose how this bias can be prevented using episode-constrained crossvalidation. Moreover, we show that a 17% higher classifier performance can be achieved by using episode constrained cross-validation for classifier parameter tuning.},

Relevance feedback methods are introduced to the CBIR area as a tool to help the user to guide the retrieval system during the search process. Search history of the retrieval system, which is the accumulated feedbacks from past retrievals, has been recently used as a prior knowledge to improve the image retrieval performance. In this paper, we introduce an image retrieval model based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) that utilizes the system's search history to find hidden image semantics of the database. Image features are integrated to the model as well. The model is capable of detecting images and image features that efficiently represent semantic classes in the database.

abstract = {In the area of image retrieval, post-retrieval processing is often used to refine the retrieval results to better satisfy users' requirements. Previous methods mainly focus on presenting users with relevant results. However, in most cases, users cannot clearly present their requirements by several query words. Therefore, relevant results with rich topic coverage are more likely to meet users' ambiguous needs. In this paper, a re-ranking method based on topic richness analysis is proposed to enrich topic coverage in retrieval results. Furthermore, a quantitative criterion called diversity scores (DS) is proposed to evaluate the improvement. Given a set of images, topics that are rarely included in the set are scarce topics, as oppose to rich topics that are widely distributed among the set. Scarce topics contribute more than rich topics do to the DS of images. Five researchers are invited to evaluate the re-ranked results both in topic coverage and relevance. Experimental results on over 20,000 images demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in improving the topic coverage of retrieval results without loss of relevance.},

We first identify the underlying topological structure of an image dataset containing different views of the objects and represent it as a neighborhood graph. The graph is then refined by identifying redundant images and removing them using morphing. This gives a smaller dataset leading to reduced space requirements and faster matching. Finally we exploit motion continuity in video and extend our algorithm to perform matching based on video input and demonstrate that the results obtained using a video sequence are much robust than using a single image. Our approach is novel in that we do not require any knowledge of camera calibration or viewpoint while generating the model. We also do not assume any constraint on motion of object in test video other than following a smooth trajectory.},

Kinematic analysis was used to segment gestures from a continuous motion stream. Human anatomy driven Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are adopted for gesture recognition and expertise identification.

The results showed that a simulated separate delivery of a news ticker and other textual information significantly increased the perceived video quality of the entire screen for native speakers. In addition, some automatable changes to the layout of news content resulted in substantial increases in perceived video quality.

The participant is situated in front of a screen reflecting their own image, and by manipulating a series of light sources, marks can be left onscreen such as drawings, messages, traces of physical objects such as faces, hands and bodies.It is the argument of the author that by allowing the user an optimum level of creative authorship within an interactive work, the user can be successfully engaged with the experience of the interaction and in turn produce and create themselves.},

abstract = {Beginning in the middle of the twentieth century, composers of experimental music developed a number of new notational representations, most often falling under the category of graphical scores. John Cage's Variations II is a prime example, utilizing only dots and lines as its basis. I describe an interactive version of Cage's piece, called here Variations 10b, where a performer can change the score and receive immediate auditory feedback as to the results of the manipulation. This stands in contrast to the process of working through the analog score, where the aural output was not coincident with movement of the dots or lines. I suggest that creating and using digital versions of these early experimental music works radically changes the process of interacting with the pieces.},

Computational frameworks can aid in revealing non-salient compositional structures in modern dance. The computational extraction of such features allows for the creation of interactive works where the movement and the digital feedback (graphics, sound etc) are integrally connected at deep level of structures. It also facilitates a better understanding of the choreographic process. There are two key contributions in this paper: (a) a systematic analysis of the observable and non-salient aspects of solo dance form, (b) computational analysis of temporal phrasing structures guided by critical understanding of observable form. Our analysis results are excellent indicating the presence of rich, latent temporal organization in specific semi-improvisatory modern dance works that may provide rich structural material for interactivity.},

abstract = {The Internet, digital television, and similar technologies have accelerated the speed of digitalization. Nevertheless, paper media forms, such as newspapers and magazines, still have large market shares, and the authors believe that these two worlds, digital and analog, will coexist even in the future, with their own market areas. However, the demands to connect between these two worlds are increasing, and barcodes and watermarking are examples of technologies used to connect them. However, a barcode occupies space and disrupts the layout of an article, and watermarking has limited capacity for embedding data.In this paper, we propose an "electronic clipping system with invisible barcodes", which connects the analog and digital worlds, addressing these problems. In this system, we overprint invisible 2D barcodes on printed articles using invisible ink, then take pictures of them using a camera equipped with a special LED (Light Emitting Diode)that the invisible ink responds to, decode the encoded data of the 2D barcode after the image is processed, and extract the information. We developed a code extraction system which can extract the information from invisible 2D barcodes even if the barcodes are overprinted on the articles in media such as newspapers, and even if the article is in color. We also made a prototype cell phone which includes both the barcode extraction code and the LED, and confirmed that we can correctly extract the information from the pictures taken by the phone.},

The problem is important as traditional mechanisms of rehabilitation are monotonous, and do not incorporate detailed quantitative assessment of recovery in addition to traditional clinical schemes. We have been working on developing an experiential media system that integrates task dependent physical therapy and cognitive stimuli within an interactive, multimodal environment. The environment provides a purposeful, engaging, visual and auditory scene in which patients can practice functional therapeutic reaching tasks, while receiving different types of simultaneous feedback indicating measures of both performance and results. There are three contributions of this paper - (a) identification of features and goals for the functional task (b) The development of sophisticated feedback (auditory and visual) mechanisms that match the semantics of action of the task. We additionally develop novel action-feedback coupling mechanisms. (c) New metrics to validate the ability of the system to promote learnability, stylization and engagement. We have validated the system for nine subjects with excellent results.},

abstract = {Segmentation of video foreground objects from background has many important applications, such as human computer interaction, video compression, multimedia content editing and manipulation. Most existing methods work on image pixels or color segments which are computationally expensive. Some methods require extensive manual inputs, static cameras, and/or rigid scenes. In this paper we propose a fully automatic foreground segmentation method based on sequential clustering of sparse image features. The sparseness makes the method computationally efficient. We use both edge and corner points extracted from each video frame. A joint spatio-temporal linear regression method is developed to compute sparse motion layers of M consecutive frames jointly under the temporal consistency constraint. Once the sparse motion layers have been identified for each frame, the corresponding dense motion layers are created using the Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The MRF model assigns the rest of the image pixels to the motion layers by considering both the color attributes and the spatial relations between each pixel and its surrounding edge/corner points. Experimental evaluations on videos taken by webcams show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

If text is presented visually, the user can skim and scroll through the content to locate relevant information. Audio output is usually presented sequentially with media player controls. For synthesized text a much more precise control is required. Actually the ability to skim and scroll through speech or auditory output will be crucial to the deployment speech output. Speakr is a speech synthesis system which permits different levels of skimming in speech outputs produced using speech synthesis. Speakr exploits the availability of the underlying text representation. Different aspects of the text representation - typographic conventions, markups, syntax, semantics, etc. - are used to achieve skim and scroll effects.},

abstract = {There is an explosion of multimedia content, especially image, on the Internet. Images as pixel arrays suffer from two deficiencies: semantic gap and geometric gap. There have been several attempts like object detection for closing the semantic gap. Recently the notion of community tagging of objects in an image has attracted a lot of attention. There has been lot of research in closing the geometric gap by 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present 3D Buddy (3dB) -a system for geometrically tagging images for 3D reconstruction.},

abstract = {Human vision system actively seeks interesting regions in images to reduce the search effort in tasks, such as object detection and recognition. Similarly, prominent actions in video sequences are more likely to attract our first sight than their surrounding neighbors. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal video attention detection technique for detecting the attended regions that correspond to both interesting objects and actions in video sequences. Both spatial and temporal saliency maps are constructed and further fused in a dynamic fashion to produce the overall spatiotemporal attention model. In the temporal attention model, motion contrast is computed based on the planar motions (homography) between images, which is estimated by applying RANSAC on point correspondences in the scene. To compensate the non-uniformity of spatial distribution of interest-points, spanning areas of motion segments are incorporated in the motion contrast computation. In the spatial attention model, a fast method for computing pixel-level saliency maps has been developed using color histograms of images. A hierarchical spatial attention representation is established to reveal the interesting points in images as well as the interesting regions. Finally, a dynamic fusion technique is applied to combine both the temporal and spatial saliency maps, where temporal attention is dominant over the spatial model when large motion contrast exists, and vice versa. The proposed spatiotemporal attention framework has been applied on over 20 testing video sequences, and attended regions are detected to highlight interesting objects and motions present in the sequences with very high user satisfaction rate.},

abstract = {Natural semantic sound clusters in an audio document, also referred to as audio elements, can be seen as an analogy to words in a text document. Based on the obtained set of audio elements, the key audio elements, or audio "keywords", can be detected, which are most prominent in characterizing the content of audio data. As such, they can be of great use for automatic audio content analysis and discovery. Motivated by the limitations of the existing methods for key audio element detection, we propose in this paper a novel unsupervised approach to audio elements weighting using multiple audio documents, analog to word weighting in text document analysis. In our approach, dominant feature vectors (DFV) are first extracted from each audio element, and used to measure the audio elements similarity, based on which the occurrence probability of one audio element in different audio documents can be estimated. Then, four factors, including expected term frequency, expected inverse document frequency, expected term duration, and expected inverse document duration, are calculated and combined to give the importance weight of each audio element. Evaluation of the obtained audio "keywords" and their usability for auditory scene segmentation and audio document clustering, performed on 5 hours of diverse audio data, shows highly promising results.},

abstract = {This paper presents an efficient approach for copies detection in a large videos archive consisting of several hundred of hours. The video content indexing method consists of extracting the dynamic behavior on the local description of interest points and further on the estimation of their trajectories along the video sequence. Analyzing the low-level description obtained allows to highlight trends of behaviors and then to assign a label of behavior to each local descriptor. Such an indexing approach has several interesting properties: it provides a rich, compact and generic description, while labels of behavior provide a high-level description of the video content. Here, we focus on video Content Based Copy Detection (CBCD). Copy detection is problematic as similarity search problem but with prominent differences. To be efficient, it requires a dedicated on-line retrieval method based on a specific voting function. This voting function must be robust to signal transformations and discriminating versus high similarities which are not copies. The method we propose in this paper is a dedicated on-line retrieval method based on a combination of the different dynamic contexts computed during the off-line indexing. A spatio-temporal registration based on the relevant combination of detected labels is then applied. This approach is evaluated using a huge video database of 300 hours with different video tests. The method is compared to a state-of-the art technique in the same conditions. We illustrate that taking labels into account in the specific voting process reduces false alarms significantly and drastically improves the precision.},

abstract = {The identification of near-duplicate keyframe (NDK) pairs is a useful task for a variety of applications such as news story threading and content-based video search. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the discovery and tracking of NDK pairs and threads in the broadcast domain. The detection of NDKs in a large data set is a challenging task due to the fact that when the data set increases linearly, the computational cost increases in a quadratic speed, and so does the number of false alarms. This paper explores the symmetric and transitive nature of near-duplicate for the effective detection and fast tracking of NDK pairs based upon the matching of local keypoints in frames. In the detection phase, we propose a robust measure, namely pattern entropy (PE), to measure the coherency of symmetric keypoint matching across the space of two keyframes. This measure is shown to be effective in discovering the NDK identity of a frame. In the tracking phase, the NDK pairs and threads are rapidly propagated and linked with sitivity without the need of detection. This step ends up a significant boost in speed efficiency. We evaluate proposed approach against a month of the 2004 broadcast videos. The experimental results indicate our approach outperforms other techniques in terms of recall and precision with a large margin. In addition, by considering the transitivity and the underlying distribution of NDK pairs along time span, a speed up of 3 to 5 times is achieved when keeping the performance close enough to the optimal one obtained by exhaustive evaluation.},

In this paper, we illustrate different user-centered design principles and specific strategies, as well as their advantages and the manner in which they enhance users' performance. We also summarize recent research findings from our lab comparing the performance characteristics of different educational interfaces that were based on user-centered design principles. One theme throughout our discussion is human-centered design that minimizes users' cognitive load, which effectively frees up mental resources for performing better while also remaining more attuned to the world around them.},

abstract = {Labeling objects in images is an essential prerequisite for many visual learning and recognition applications that depend on training data, such as image retrieval, object detection and recognition. Manually creating labels in images is not only time-consuming but also subject to human labeling errors, and eventually, becomes impossible for a large scale image database. Semi-supervised learning (SSL)algorithms such as Gaussian random field (GRF)can be applied to labeling objects in images since they have the ability to include a large amount of unlabeled data while requiring only a small amount of labeled data. However, the one-shot property of GRF prevents it from achieving good labeling performance. In this paper, we presents a novel object labeling tool, SmartLabel, to semi-automatically label objects in images. The algorithm of SmartLabel has four innovations over GRF:1)soft labeling,2)graph construction with spatial constraints, 3)iterated harmonic energy minimization, and 4)using relevance feedback to incorporate human interaction in the loop. As demonstrated in datasets of six object categories, the proposed SmartLabel not only works effectively even with a very small amount of user input (e.g., 1 .5%of image size)but also achieves significant improvement over GRF.},

abstract = {The performance of image classifiers largely depends on two inter-related issues:(1)suitable frameworks for image content representation and automatic feature extraction;(2) effective algorithms for image classifier training and feature subset selection. To address the first issue, a multiresolution grid-based framework is proposed for image content representation and feature extraction to bypass the time-consuming and erroneous process for image segmentation. To address the second issue, a hierarchical boosting algorithm is proposed by incorporating feature hierarchy and boosting to scale up SVM image classifier training in high-dimensional feature space. The high-dimensional multi-modal heterogeneous visual features are partitioned into multiple low-dimensional single-modal homogeneous feature subsets and each of them characterizes certain visual property of images. For each homogeneous feature subset, principal component analysis (PCA)is performed to exploit the feature correlations and a weak classifier is learned simultaneously. After the weak classifiers for different feature subsets and grid sizes are available, they are combined to boost an optimal classifier for the given object class or image concept, and the most representative feature subsets and grid sizes are selected. Our experiments on a specific domain of natural images have obtained very positive results.},

The capability of annotating pictures by computers can lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of applications including Web image search, online picture-sharing communities, and scientific experiments. In our work, by advancing statistical modeling and optimization techniques, we can train computers about hundreds of semantic concepts using example pictures from each concept. The ALIPR (Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures -Real Time)system of fully automatic and high speed annotation for online pictures has been constructed. Thousands of pictures from an Internet photo-sharing site, unrelated to the source of those pictures used in the training process, have been tested.

abstract = {In this paper, we present an event-on-demand (EoD)video adaptation system. The proposed system supports users in deciding their events of interest and considers network conditions to adapt video source by event selection and frame dropping.Firstly, events are detected by audio/video analysis and annotated by the description schemes (DSs)provided by MPEG-7 Multimedia Description Schemes (MDSs). And then, to achieve a generic adaptation solution, the adaptation is developed following MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA)framework. We look at early release of the MPEG-21 Reference Software on XML generation and develop our own system for EoD video adaptation in three steps:1) the event information is parsed from MPEG-7 annotation XML file together with bitstream to generate generic Bitstream Syntax Description (gBSD). 2) Users' preference, Network Characteristic and Adaptation QoS (AQoS) are considered for making adaptation decision. 3) adaptation engine automatically parses adaptation decisions and gBSD to achieve adaptation.Unlike most existing adaptation work, the system adapts video of events with interest according to users' preference. Implementation following MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 standards provides a generic video adaptation solution. gBSD based adaptation avoids complex video computation. 30 students from various departments were invited to test the system and their responses has been positive.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel macroblock mode decision algorithm for inter-frame prediction based on machine learning techniques to be used as part of a very low complexity MPEG-2 to H.264 video transcoder. Since coding mode decisions take up the most resources in video transcoding, a fast macro block (MB) mode estimation would lead to reduced complexity. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis that MB coding mode decisions in H.264 video have a correlation with the distribution of the motion compensated residual in MPEG-2 video. We use machine learning tools to exploit the correlation and derive decision trees to classify the incoming MPEG-2 MBs into one of the 11 coding modes in H.264. The proposed approach reduces the H.264 MB mode computation process into a decision tree lookup with very low complexity. The proposed transcoder is compared with a reference transcoder comprised of a MPEG-2 decoder and an H.264 encoder. Our results show that the proposed transcoder reduces the H.264 encoding time by over 95% with negligible loss in quality and bitrate.},

In this paper we present a format-independent dependency model aimed at specifying, validating and reasoning about structural dependency in multimedia streams. Based on this model, we developed a universal dependency description language and a dependency validation service to serve as an infrastructure for content-aware transport layers. Driven by application knowledge, this special form of a cross-layer design enables lower layers to reason about the impact of data loss and drops during transmission while being unaware of the real data format.We outline, how this infrastructure can be used to build content-aware error protection policies and explain how applications need to specify dependency and prepare media streams in order to gain benefits from those policies. While costs and benefits of a dependency model are only quantifiable in conjunction with special policies, we report on the general worst-case costs of our model here.},

abstract = {Insufficiency of labeled training data is a major obstacle for automatically annotating large-scale video databases with semantic concepts. Existing semi-supervised learning algorithms based on parametric models try to tackle this issue by incorporating the information in a large amount of unlabeled data. However, they are based on a "model assumption" that the assumed generative model is correct, which usually cannot be satisfied in automatic video annotation due to the large variations of video semantic concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm, named Semi Supervised Learning by Kernel Density Estimation (SSLKDE), which is based on a non-parametric method, and therefore the "model assumption" is avoided. While only labeled data are utilized in the classical Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approach, in SSLKDE both labeled and unlabeled data are leveraged to estimate class conditional probability densities based on an extended form of KDE. We also investigate the connection between SSLKDE and existing graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms. Experiments prove that SSLKDE significantly outperforms existing supervised methods for video annotation.},

abstract = {While automatic image annotation remains an actively pursued research topic, enhancement of image search through its use has not been extensively explored. We propose an annotation-driven image retrieval approach and argue that under a number of different scenarios, this is very effective for semantically meaningful image search. In particular, our system is demonstrated to effectively handle cases of partially tagged and completely untagged image databases, multiple keyword queries, and example based queries with or without tags, all in near-realtime. Because our approach utilizes extra knowledge from a training dataset, it outperforms state-of-the-art visual similarity based retrieval techniques. For this purpose, a novel structure-composition model constructed from Beta distributions is developed to capture the spatial relationship among segmented regions of images. This model combined with the Gaussian mixture model produces scalable categorization of generic images. The categorization results are found to surpass previously reported results in speed and accuracy. Our novel annotation framework utilizes the categorization results to select tags based on term frequency, term saliency, and a WordNet-based measure of congruity, to boost salient tags while penalizing potentially unrelated ones. A bag of words distance measure based on WordNet is used to compute semantic similarity. The effectiveness of our approach is shown through extensive experiments.},

Comparative user studies of a multimedia browser designed to demonstrate the utility of social metadata indicate the usefulness of a simple interface allowing navigation and filtering in these terms.

abstract = {Healthcare is a data-rich but information-poor domain. Terabytes of multimedia medical data are being generated on a monthly basis in a typical healthcare organization in order to document patients' health status and care process. Government and health-related organizations are pushing for fully electronic, cross-institution, integrated Electronic Health Records to provide a better, cost effective and more complete access to this data. However, provision of efficient access to the content of such records for timely and decision-enabling information extraction will not be available. Such a capability is essential for providing efficient decision support and objective evidence to clinicians. In addition researchers, medical students, patients, and payers could also benefit from it. We present the idea of concept-based multimedia health records, which aims at organizing the health records at the information level. We will explore the opportunities and possibilities that such an organization will provide, what role the field of multimedia content management could play to materialize this type of health record organization, and what the challenges will be in the quest for realizing the idea.We believe that the field of multimedia can play a very active role in taking healthcare information systems to the next level by facilitating the access to decision-enabling information for different types of users in healthcare. Our goal is to share with the community our thoughts on where the field of multimedia content management research should be focusing its attention to have a fundamental impact on the practice of medicine.},

abstract = {While there have been great advances in quantification of the genotype of organisms, including full genomes for many species, the quantification of phenotype is at a comparatively primitive stage. Part of the reason is technical difficulty: the phenotype covers a wide range of characteristics, ranging from static morphological features, to dynamic behavior. The latter poses challenges that are in the area of multimedia signal processing. Automated analysis of video and audio recordings of animal and human behavior is a growing area of research, ranging from the behavioral phenotyping of genetically modified mice or drosophila to the study of song learning in birds and speech acquisition in human infants. This paper reviews recent advances and identifies key problems for a range of behavior experiments that use audio and video recording. This research area offers both research challenges and an application domain for advanced multimedia signal processing. There are a number of MMSP tools that now exist which are directly relevant for behavioral quantification, such as speech recognition, video analysis and more recently, wired and wireless sensor networks for surveillance. The research challenge is to adapt these tools and to develop new ones required for studying human and animal behavior in a high throughput manner while minimizing human intervention. In contrast with consumer applications, in the research arena there is less of a penalty for computational complexity, so that algorithmic quality can be maximized through the utilization of larger computational resources that are available to the biomedical researcher.},

During recent years, the research of the border zones of science and art have once again become the central theme of theoretical literature. Smalltalk is also interpretable within this relational system, as it consciously, and in an ironic format, employs a scientific approach.},

Typical situations that foster Social Interactions include gathering around a table. Therefore, we think it is possible to visualize larger communities through obtaining and processing Social Interaction data via table-like interfaces.As one part of group research project, here we introduce an art piece, named "Tabletop Community", that enables the visualization of Social Interactions around the table. Through this artwork system, users/participants easily record the state and atmosphere of each Interaction. The system visualizes the state of the entire community as an interactive network visualization. Here we introduce past results along with the current progress of the system.},

Working in precarious unison, the shadows of the puppets are synchronized with the animation, creating a unique live action performance. Animation and sound are composited with shadows in real time; rather than relying on a series of pre-rendered animation sequences, the artist produces "motion pictures" via a combination of seasonal sounds, live shadow puppet manipulation, and the projection of shadow-like animation sequences.},
