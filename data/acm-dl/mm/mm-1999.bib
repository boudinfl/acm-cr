abstract = {Mixed reality (MR) systems which integrate the virtual world and the real world have become a major topic in the research area of multimedia. As a practical application of these MR systems, we propose an efficient method for making a 3D map from real-world video data. The proposed method is an automatic organization method focusing on video objects to describe video data in an efficient way, i.e., by collating the real-world video data with map information using DP matching. To demonstrate the reliability of this method, we describe successful experiments that we performed using 3D information obtained from the real-world video data.},

After extracting a reference text block, we use an image matching technique to find the corresponding text blocks in consecutive frames. We register these text blocks to subpixel levels by using image interpolation techniques to improve both correspondence and text resolution. The registered text blocks are averaged to obtain a new text block with a clean background and a higher resolution. Experiments conducted on several video sequences show that our enhancement scheme can improve the accuracy of commercial off-the-shelf OCR considerably.},

In the proposed scheme, the type of each macroblock in a B-frame is compared with the type of corresponding macroblock (i.e. the macroblock in the same position) of the previous B-frame. The results of comparisons are accumulated and compared to a threshold in order to decide if a shot change occurs. Since the proposed scheme uses not only information about the type of each macroblock but also its location, it can provide more robust detection capability. Moreover, since the proposed scheme can also detect shot changes in both I- and P-frames based on the information in B-frame, it can detect a changing point more precisely, that is, the granularity of detection is the frame in the proposed scheme.},

For most sites it is a crucial matter to keep a close tie between the users and the site.More and more Web sites build close relationships with their users by adapting to their needs and therefore providing a personal experience. One aspect of personalization is the recommendation and presentation of information and products so that users can access the site more efficiently. However, powerful filtering technology is required in order to identify relevant items for each user.In this paper we describe how collaborative filtering and content-based filtering can be combined to provide better performance for filtering information. Filtering techniques of various nature are integrated in a weighed mix to achieve more robust results and to profit from automatic multimedia indexing technologies. The combined approach is evaluated in a prototype user-adapting Web site, the Active WebMuseum.},

abstract = {Adaptation techniques for multimedia presentations are mainly concerned with switching between different qualities of single media elements to reduce the data volume and by this to adapt to limited presentation resources. This kind of adaptation, however, is limited to an inherent lower bound, i.e., the lowest acceptable technical quality of the respective media type. To overcome this limitation, we propose cross-media adaptation in which the presentation alternatives can be media elements of different media type, even different fragments. Thereby, the alternatives can extremely vary in media type and data volume and this enormously widens the possibilities to efficiently adapt to the current presentation resources. However, the adapted presentation must still convey the same content as the original one, hence, the substitution of media elements and fragments must preserve the presentation semantics. Therefore, our cross-media adaptation strategy provides models for the automatic augmentation of multimedia documents by semantically equivalent presentation alternatives. Additionally, during presentation, substitution models enforce a semantically correct information flow in case of dynamic adaptation to varying presentation resources. The cross-media adaptation strategy allows for flexible reuse of multimedia content in many different environments and, at the same time, maintains a semantically correct information flow of the presentation.},

abstract = {Two problems in the design and deployment of multimedia applications are the lack of design-time and run-time flexibility. In this paper we discuss a general methodology for tackling these issues. The work presented here is an extension of the AlphaOmega framework of [4]. In that framework we showed how the intuitive notion of an object representing its properties and capabilities to other objects differentially could be exploited to provide a powerful but easy way to change the behavior and interfaces of an application, dynamically if desired. In this paper, we develop a formal approach to the basic principles of the AlphaOmega framework. This leads to the definition of a formal system called the αω-calculus. The αω-calculus identifies a set of programming language abstractions that can be consistently added to any object-oriented language. While the calculus captures the intuitive notions underlying the AlphaOmega framework, it also goes beyond the original framework in power and flexibility. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by working with an example that shows how it provides unifying abstractions for such seemingly diverse domains as interactive distance learning and various issues in the area of multimedia documents.},

abstract = {With the growth in digital representations of music, and of music stored in these representations, it is increasingly attractive to search collections of music. One mode of search is by similarity, but, for music, similarity search presents several difficulties: in particular, for melodic query support, deciding what part of the music is likely to be perceived as the theme by a listener, and deciding whether two pieces of music with different sequences of notes represent the same theme. In this paper we propose a three-stage framework for matching pieces of music. We use the framework to compare a range of techniques for determining whether two pieces of music are similar, by experimentally testing their ability to retrieve different transcriptions of the same piece of music from a large collection of MIDI files. These experiments show that different comparison techniques differ widely in their effectiveness; and that, by instantiating the framework with appropriate music manipulation and comparison techniques, pieces of music that match a query can be identified in a large collection.},

abstract = {A real-time audio segmentation and indexing scheme is presented in this paper. Audio recordings are segmented and classified into basic audio types such as silence, speech, music, song, environmental sound, speech with the music background, environmental sound with the music background, etc. Simple audio features such as the energy function, the average zero-crossing rate, the fundamental frequency, and the spectral peak track are adopted in this system to ensure on-line processing. Morphological and statistical analysis for temporal curves of these features are performed to show differences among different types of audio. A heuristic rule-based procedure is then developed to segment and classify audio signals by using these features. The proposed approach is generic and model free. It can be applied to almost any content-based audio management system. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves an accuracy rate of more than 90% for audio classification. Examples for segmentation and indexing of accompanying audio signals in movies and video programs are also provided.},

The SHLL framework consists of three major modules: (1) SHLL Recorder- for recording the temporal information of the AV lecture and the HTML-based lecture notes navigation processes. (2) SHLL Event Server- for receiving, depositing, and multicasting SHLL events. (3) SHLL Browser- for presentation of the synchronized AV lecture and HTML-based lecture notes navigation.To manage the synchronization presentation of different media, we have proposed an RTP-based Multi-Sync synchronization model, which account for the human perception factors. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SHLL framework and synchronization model, a RealSystem-based prototype Synchronized HTML-AV Distance Lecture System has been implemented using Java/JavaScript and C. The prototype system certifies the feasibility of the proposed framework for synchronized hypermedia live multicasting.},

This paper reports results from interviews with 24 Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) attendees whose presentations or contributions to IETF sessions were transmitted on the multicast backbone (Mbone). Due to a high level of trust in the organization, these users had few initial concerns about the privacy implications of this technology. However, interviewees' trust relied on inaccurate assumptions, since the interviews revealed a number of potential and actual invasions of privacy in transmission, recording and editing of multicast data. Previous research found that users who experience an unexpected invasion of their privacy are not only likely to reject the technology that afforded the invasion, but lose trust in the organization that introduced it [2,3]. We discuss a number of mechanisms and policies for protecting users' privacy in this particular application, and propose a strategy for introducing networked multimedia technology in general.},

abstract = {NoteLook is a client-server system designed and built to support multimedia note taking in meetings with digital video and ink. It is integrated into a conference room equipped with computer controllable video cameras, video conference camera, and a large display rear video projector. The NoteLook client application runs on wireless pen-based notebook computers. Video channels containing images of the room activity and presentation material are transmitted by the NoteLook servers to the clients, and the images can be interactively and automatically incorporated into the note pages. Users can select channels, snap in large background images and sequences of thumbnails, and write freeform ink notes. A smart video source management component enables the capture of high quality images of the presentation material from a variety of sources. For accessing and browsing the notes and recorded video, NoteLook generates Web pages with links from the images and ink strokes correlated to the video.},

Identification of meeting participants is essential for creating such a multimedia meeting record. Moreover, knowing who is speaking can enhance the performance of speech recognition and indexing meeting transcription. In this paper, we present an approach that identifies meeting participants by fusing multimodal inputs. We use face ID, speaker ID, color appearance ID, and sound source directional ID to identify and track meeting. After describing the different modules in detail, we will discuss a framework for combining the information sources.

In the immersive teleconference paradigm, one frame of the teleconference is a panorama that is constructed from a compound-image sensing device. These frames are rendered at the remote site on a projection surface that surrounds the user, creating an immersive feeling of presence and participation in the teleconference. Our algorithm efficiently creates panoramic frames for a teleconference session that are both geometrically registered and intensity blended. We demonstrate a prototype that is able to capture images from a compound-image sensor, register them into a seamless panoramic frame, and render those panoramic frames on a projection surface at 30 frames per second.},

abstract = {Current camera-monitor teleconferencing applications produce unrealistic imagery and break any sense of presence for the participants. Other capture/display technologies can be used to provide more compelling teleconferencing. However, complex geometries in capture/display systems make producing geometrically correct imagery difficult. It is usually impractical to detect, model and compensate for all effects introduced by the capture/display system. Most applications simply ignore these issues and rely on the user acceptance of the camera-monitor paradigm.This paper presents a new and simple technique for producing geometrically correct imagery for teleconferencing environments. The necessary image transformations are derived by finding a mapping between a capture and display device for a fixed viewer location. The capture/display relationship is computed directly in device coordinates and completely avoids the need for any intermediate, complex representations of screen geometry, capture and display distortions, and viewer location. We describe our approach and demonstrate it via several prototype implementations that operate in real-time and provide a substantially more compelling sense of presence than the standard teleconferencing paradigm.},

Nearly all broadcasting protocols assume that the client set-top box has enough storage to store between 48 and 60 minutes of video. We propose to use this storage to anticipate the customer requests and to preload, say, the first 3 minutes of the top 16 to 20 videos. This would provide instantaneous access to these videos and also eliminate the extra bandwidth required to handle compressed video signal.We present two broadcasting protocols using partial preloading to eliminate this extra bandwidth. The first of these protocols, Polyharmonic Broadcasting with Partial Preloading (PHB-PP), partitions each video into between 20 and 160 segments of equal duration and allocates a separate data stream to each individual segment. Our second protocol, the Mayan Temple Broadcasting protocol, uses fewer data streams but requires more overall bandwidth.},

By combining this technique for delivery of “hot” video objects with controlled multicast [4] for delivery of “cold” video objects, we design an efficient video delivery scheme referred to as selective catching. Through empirical studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed video delivery schemes.},

Request architectures experience a limit in the number of clients that can be adequately serviced. Broadcast architectures require large, often unavailable, bandwidth. In addition, it is difficult to limit viewing to a target audience. In this paper, we present a new architecture for a metropolitan VOD service that we name requestcasting. Our architecture combines the two general approaches of request and broadcast, but not their respective limitations. With the requestcast architecture, we implement an improved pyramid broadcasting protocol. Our synchronized method of employing pyramid broadcasting is key to providing robust VOD service.},

abstract = {Patching is a cost efficient channel-sharing technique for video-on-demand systems. However, its performance is limited due to the fact that a video stream cannot be shared unless it delivers the video in its entirety. As a result, larger and larger patches are required to serve new requests as the temporal distance increases. To avoid the overwhelming accumulation of patching cost, the entire video must be delivered frequently. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a new technique called Transition Patching. Our performance study shows that the new scheme outperforms the existing approach under all scenarios. In particular, the performance gain is more significant when the request rate is higher. We note that such improvement is achieved without extra download bandwidth required at the client site. The implementation cost, therefore, is the same as the original Patching scheme.},

We show how such representation is able to capture video data semantics, from very low level semantics such as scene change and object movements to higher level semantics involving high-level textual description of events. A Petri-net based method for query processing of multi-object spatio-temporal video-data queries is presented.},

Furthermore, from the real noise distribution we derive a distortion measure, which consistently provides improved accuracy.

Unfortunately, most digital video encoding standards do not degrade gracefully in the face of packet losses, which often occur in a bursty fashion. We propose an new video encoding system that scales well with respect to the network's performance and degrades gracefully under packet loss. Our encoder sends packets that consist of a small random subset of pixels distributed throughout a video frame. The receiver places samples in their proper location (through a previously agreed ordering), and applies a reconstruction algorithm on the received samples to produce an image. Each of the packets is independent, and does not depend on the successful transmission of any other packets. Additionally, each packet contains information that is distributed over the entire image. We also apply spatial and temporal optimization to achieve better compression.},

Existing techniques solve the problem by storing the down-converted blocks into memory instead of the full-resolution blocks. While the memory is reduced, these techniques introduce drift errors because the decoder does not have the same pixels as the encoder in performing motion-compensated prediction. The approach proposed here alleviates the problem by tracking the drift at the decoder. It improves the video quality without any increase in decoder complexity. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using both objective and subjective tests. This minimum-drift approach is very simple to implement and can also be applied for memory reduction of a full resolution HDTV decoder.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new watermarking technique for digital images. Our approach modifies blocks of the image after projecting them onto certain directions. By quantizing the projected blocks to even and odd values we can represent the hidden information properly. The proposed algorithm does the modification progressively to ensure successful data extraction without any prior information being sent to the receiver side. In order to increase the robustness of our watermark to scaling and rotation attacks we also present a solution to recover the original size and orientation based on a training sequence which is inserted as part of the watermark.},

abstract = {A method of allowing pitch preservation of sound with variable-rate video playback is suggested. This is an important factor in monitoring of audio content for cueing purposes. Methods of separately considering a signal's frequency and time representations are considered with a view to performing time-scale modification with preservation of local periodicity (pitch). Particular emphasis is placed upon granulation in time of a sampled source — a technique based upon Dennis Gabor's landmark papers in 1946 and 1947 and developed in the field of computer music. This relatively simple method requires no prior signal analysis and is therefore a less computationally expensive method of achieving the goals stated above. This is an important point considering the need for real-time implementation. The process does however introduce some distortion, and investigation into how this may be minimised is necessary to produce acceptable results.},

abstract = {The Informedia Digital Video Library contains over 2000 hours of video, growing at a rate of 15 hours per week. A good query engine is not sufficient for information retrieval because often the candidate result sets grow in number as the library grows. Video digests summarize sets of stories from the library, providing users with a visual mechanism for interactive browsing and query refinement. These digests are generated dynamically under the direction of the user based on automatically derived metadata from the video library. Three types of digests are discussed: VIBE digests emphasizing word relationships, timelines showing trends against time, and maps showing geographic correlations. Multiple digests can be combined into a single view or animated into a temporal presentation.},

We formalize the selection process as an optimization problem, and we study how to take into account duration in the selection of stories. Experiments show that a simple heuristic can provide high quality selection with little computation. We also describe two prototypes, which implement two different mechanisms for the construction of user profiles:
explicit specification, using a category-based model,implicit specification, using a keyword-based model.},

Given a clip of video, firstly human joints are tracked with the support of Kalman filter and morph-block based match in the image sequence. Then corresponding sequence of three-dimension (3D) human motion skeleton is constructed under the perspective projection using camera calibration and human anatomy knowledge. Finally a motion library is established automatically by annotating multiform motion attributes, which can be browsed and queried by the animator. This approach has the characteristic of rich source material, low computing cost, efficient production, and realistic animation result. We demonstrate it on several video clips of people doing full body movements, and visualize the results by re-animating a 3D human skeleton model.},

The result is a compact and visually pleasing summary that captures semantically important events, and is suitable for printing or Web access.

Many efforts in this area focus on audio data that contains some built-in semantic information structure such as in broadcast news, or focus on classification of audio that contains a single type of sound such as cleaar speech or clear music only. In the CueVideo system, we detect and classify audio that consists of mixed audio, i.e. combinations of speech and music together with other types of background sounds. Segmentation of mixed audio has applications in detection of story boundaries in video, spoken document retrieval systems, audio retrieval systems etc. We modify and combine audio features known to be effective in distinguishing speech from music, and examine their behavior on mixed audio. Our preliminary experimental results show that we can achieve a classification accuracy of over 80% for such mixed audio. Our study also provides us with several helpful insights related to analyzing mixed audio in the context of real applications.},

We have evaluated the performance by integrating the proposed psychoacoustic model into an audio coder similar to MPEG-2 AAC, which contains only the basic coding tools. Our model performs better than or as well as the psychoacoustic model suggested in the MPEG-2 AAC audio coding standard for all the test signals. We can achieve almost transparent quality with bitrate below 64 kbps for most of the critical test signals. Significant improvements have been achieved with speech signals, which are always difficult for transform audio coders.},

The system organizes processors into a hierarchy of levels. Processes at each level of the hierarchy can exploit different types of parallelism and coordinate the actions of lower levels. To control the effect, control messages must be distributed to processors in the hierarchy while preserving the independence of each level. This requires a control mechanism that supports efficient delivery of messages to groups of processors, tunable reliability semantics, and recoverable state information. We describe a mechanism that meets these requirements that uses IP-Multicast, the Scalable Reliable Multicast protocol, and the Scalable Naming and Announcement Protocol. We also describe an optimization that provides a flexible framework for linking the control of different aspects of one or more related video effects.},

abstract = {Multimedia systems such as video-on-demand (VOD) servers are time critical systems. These systems have strict response times, which implies that a delayed response can have serious consequence. For instance, in the case of a VOD server, an immediate consequence of a delayed response time can be user dissatisfaction, what can ultimately lead to the end of a business based on this system. Therefore, analysis and verification of timing properties of multimedia systems is an important problem. To verify if time critical systems satisfy their time bounds, we discuss the use of formal methods tools, in the verification and analysis of multimedia systems. We have used Verus (a formal verification tool) to model and analyze the ALMADEM-VOD server, a component of a true video-on-demand system. The modeling of this server in Verus has provided great insight into its design and its dynamic behavior. Using the quantitative estimates provided by Verus, we have determined performance bounds to the server. These bounds have pointed out that the performance curve of the actual server was almost at the predicted upper bound (worst case) level. These curves have uncovered design inefficiencies. After optimizing the server, its performance has improved over 40%, showing how useful formal verification can be used successfully during the design of multimedia systems.},

abstract = {Parallel servers for I/O and compute intensive continuous media applications are difficult to develop. A server application comprises many threads located in different address spaces as well as files striped over multiple disks located on different computers. The present contribution describes the construction of a continuous media server, the 4D beating heart slice server, based on a computer-aided parallelization tool (CAP) and on a library of parallel file system components enabling the combination of pipelined parallel disk access and processing operations. Thanks to CAP, the presented architecture is concisely described as a set of threads, operations located within the threads and flow of data and parameters (tokens) between operations. Continuous media applications are supported by allowing tokens to be suspended during a period of time specified by a user-defined function. Our target application, the 4D beating heart server supports the extraction of freely oriented slices from a 4D beating heart volume (one 3D volume per time sample). This server application requires both a high I/O throughput for accessing from disks the set of 4D sub-volumes (extents) intersecting the desired slices and a large amount of processing power to extract these slices and to resample them into the display grid. With a server configuration of 3 PCs and 24 disks, up to 7.3 slices can be delivered per second, i.e. 43 MB/s are continuously read from disks and 4.1 MB/s of slice parts are extracted, transfered to the client, merged, buffered and displayed. This performance is close to the maximal performance deliverable by the underlying hardware. The observed single stream server delay jitter varies between 0.6s (52% of maximal display rate) and 1.4s (92% of the maximal display rate). For the same resource utilization, the jitter is proportional to the number of streams that are accessed synchronously.The presented 4D beating heart application suggests that powerful continuous media server applications can be built on top of a set of simple PCs connected to SCSI disks.},

abstract = {Phoenix is a real-time network-attached storage device (NASD) that guarantees real-time data delivery to network clients even across single disk failure. The service interfaces that Phoenix provides are best-effort/real-time reads/writes based on unique object identifiers and block offsets. Data retrieval from Phoenix can be serviced in server push or client pull modes. Phoenix's real-time disk subsystem performance results from a standard cycle-based scan-order disk scheduling mechanism. However, the disk I/O cycle of Phoenix is either completely active or completely idle. This on-off disk scheduling model effectively reduces the power consumption of the disk subsystem, without increasing the buffer size requirement. Phoenix also exploits unused disk storage space and maintains additional redundancy beyond the generic RAID5-style parity. This extra redundancy, typically in the form of block replication, reduces the time to reconstruct the data on the failed disk. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Phoenix, one of the first, if not the first, NASDs that support fault-tolerant, real-time, and low-power network storage service.},

abstract = {We evaluate two architectural alternatives—partitioned and integrated—for designing next generation file systems. Whereas a partitioned server employs a separate file system for each application class, an integrated file server multiplexes its resources among all application classes; we evaluate the performance of the two architectures with respect to sharing of disk bandwidth among the application classes. We show that although the problem of sharing disk bandwidth in integrated file systems is conceptually similar to that of sharing network link bandwidth in integrated services networks, the arguments that demonstrate the superiority of integrated services networks over separate networks are not applicable to file systems. Furthermore, we show that: (i) an integrated server outperforms the partitioned server in a large operating region and has slightly worse performance in the remaining region, (ii) the capacity of an integrated server is larger than that of the partitioned server, and (iii) an integrated server outperforms the partitioned server by up to a factor of 6 in the presence of bursty workloads.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the case for using specifically configured protocol stacks geared towards human requirements in the delivery of distributed multimedia. We define Quality of Perception (QoP) as representing the user side of the more technical and traditional Quality of Service (QoS). QoP is a term which encompasses not only a user's satisfaction with the quality of multimedia presentations, but also his/her ability to analyse, synthesise and assimilate the informational content of multimedia displays. The Dynamically Reconfigurable Protocol Stacks (DRoPS) architecture supports low cost reconfiguration of individual protocol mechanisms in an attempt to best maintain QoP in connections where the provided QoS fluctuates unpredictably. Results show that DRoPS can be used to improve on the QoP provided by legacy protocol stacks (TCP/IP, UDP/IP), especially in the case of dynamic and complex sequences.},

abstract = {As streaming audio-video technology becomes widespread, there is a dramatic increase in the amount of multimedia content available on the net. Users face a new challenge: How to examine large amounts of multimedia content quickly. One technique that can enable quick overview of multimedia is video summaries; that is, a shorter version assembled by picking important segments from the original.We evaluate three techniques for automatic creation of summaries for online audio-video presentations. These techniques exploit information in the audio signal (e.g., pitch and pause information), knowledge of slide transition points in the presentation, and information about access patterns of previous users. We report a user study that compares automatically generated summaries that are 20%-25% the length of full presentations to author generated summaries. Users learn from the computer-generated summaries, although less than from authors' summaries. They initially find computer-generated summaries less coherent, but quickly grow accustomed to them.},
