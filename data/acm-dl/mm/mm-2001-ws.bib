abstract = {A novel access structure for similarity search in metric databases, called Similarity Hashing (SH), is proposed. It is a multi-level hash structure, consisting of search-separable bucket sets on each level. The structure supports easy insertion and bounded search costs, because at most one bucket needs to be accessed at each level for range queries up to a pre-defined value of search radius. At the same time, the pivot-based strategy significantly reduces the number of distance computations. Contrary to tree organizations, the SH structure is suitable for distributed and parallel implementations.},

Our implementation uses a very compact binary signature for the images' global colour histogram thus allowing the use of main-memory to store and search a reasonably sized image main-memory to store and search a reasonably sized image collection. Our results show that our parallel search of an S-tree is able to achieve good speedups; for instance, a 50,000 signature S-tree, with a branching factor of 8, searched using 4 processors is 3 times faster than using a single processor.},

abstract = {Multimedia information becomes available for many sources around the world exponentially; man people would like to use this information for various purposes, making the multi media database to be accessed by many users. This challenging situation led to the need for a solution that quickly and efficiently searches for and/or filters various types of multimedia information of user interest. MPEG-7 is a multimedia content description standard that describes multimedia contents so users can search, browse, and retrieve the contents more efficiently and effectively than they could using today's leading text-based search engines. The significance of spatial relationships has been pointed out by a number of researchers in spatial and image databases. Spatial relationship representations used by GIS (Geographic Information System) community are not enough to express image contents because they lack the expressive power. Therefore we propose the new improved spatial relationships that are suitable for expressing contents of images. In order to retrieve the desired multimedia contents, we have to search the appropriate Description Schemes (DSs) that describes structure and semantics of the multimedia data. MPEG-7 does not describe any indexing mechanism of those DSs. We may need some indexing mechanism in order to make it fast and efficient retrieval.},

abstract = {Content-based image retrieval using region segmentation has been an active research area in the past few years. Constrasting to traditional approaches, which compute only global features of images, the region-based methods extract features of the segmented regions and perform similarity comparisons at the granularity of region. In this paper, we propose a novel region-based retrieval method, Self-Learned Region Importance (SLRI). In this method, image similarity measure is based on the region importance learned from users' feedback. The region importance that coincides that human perception con not only be used in a query session, but also be memorized and cumulated for future queries. Experimental results on a database of about 8,600 general-purposed images show the effectiveness of our method using relevance feedback.},

abstract = {Shaped-based image retrieval is achieved by measuring the spatial topology distance between the input image and each template image in the database. The contour of an object in the input image is regularly sampled as feature points which are matched to those of a template image by a pseudo elastic matching process. The elastic matching is achieved by performing the self-organizing map algorithm on the network which is constructed by distributing neurons to feature locations of the template image. The spatial topology distance is measured by the degree of distortion of the template pattern before and after elastic matching. We tested the method on the Columbia Object Image Library database. Preliminary experiments suggested promising result by our approach.},

abstract = {The application of images and video has increased significantly in recent years. It is crucial to develop indexing techniques for searching images and video on their content. Due to the lower computational complexity, compressed domain indexing techniques are becoming popular. Among the compression techniques, discrete-wavelet-transform based techiques have become popular because of their excellent energy compaction and multi-resolution capability, and has been adopted in the JPEDG2000 image compression standard. In this paper, an efficient indexing scheme in the JPEG2000 framework is proposed. Here, the information on the numbers of bit-planes in code-blocks is directly extracted from the packet header of a JPEG2000 compressed image without decompressing the bitstream. A vector comprising variance and mean of a few selected bit-planes of the code-blocks is used as the image index. Image retrieval is performed by matching the index of the query and candidate images from the database. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides a good indexing performance.},

abstract = {This papers describes a benchmark test for content-based image retrieval systems (CBIRSs) with the query by example (QBE) query paradigm. This benchmark is accessible via the Internet and thus allows to evaluate any CBIRS which is compliant with Multimedia Retrieval Markup Language (MRML) for query formulation and result transmission. Thus it allows a quick and easy comparison between different features and algorithms for CBIRSs. The benchmark is based on a standardized communication protocol to do the communication between benchmark server and benchmarked system and it uses a freely downloadable image database (DB) to make the results reproducible. A CBIR system that uses MRML and other components to develop MRML-based applications can be downloaded free of charge as well. The evaluation is based on several queries and known relevance sets for these queries. Several answer sets for one query image are possible if judgments of several users exist, thus almost any sort of judgment can be incorporated into the system. The final results are averaged over all queries. The evaluation of several steps of relevance feedback (RF) based on the collected relevance judgments is also included into the benchmark. The performance of RF is often regarded to be even more important than the performance in the first query step because only with RF the adaptation of the system to the users subjective goal can be measured. For the evaluation of a system with RF, the same evaluation measures are used as for the first query step.},
