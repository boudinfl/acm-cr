abstract = {The printing press was invented in the middle of the 15th century, yet it took 100 years before a book was considered dangerous enough to be banned. 150 years before science was invented, almost 200 years before a new kind of political essay was invented, and more than 300 hundred years before a country with an invented political system (the US) could be argued into existence via the press and a citizenry that could understand the arguments. Schooling and general literacy were also fruits of the press, and also took many centuries to become established. The commercial computer is now about 50 years old and is still imitating the paper culture that came before it, just as the printing press did with the manuscript culture it gradually replaced. No media revolution can be said to have happened without a general establishment of “literacy”: fluent “reading” and “writing” at the highest level of ideas that the medium can represent. With computers, we are so far from that fluent literacy — or even understanding what that literacy should resemble — that we could claim that the computer revolution hasn't even started. This talk will try to put a shape to the real computer revolution to come.},

abstract = {The rapid development of Internet has resulted in more and more multimedia in Web content. However, due to the limitation in the bandwidth and huge size of the multimedia data, users always suffer from long time waiting. On the other hand, if we can predict the web object or page that the user most likely will view next while the user is viewing the current page, and pre-fetch the content, then the perceived network latency can be significantly reduced. In this paper, we present an n-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large web log to predict the users' future requests. Our model is based on a simple extension of existing point-based models for such predictions, but our results show that by sacrificing the applicability somewhat one can gain a great deal in prediction precision. Also we present an efficient method to compress the prediction model size so that it can be fitted into the main memory. Our result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the web, including pro-fetching, enhancement of recommendation systems as well as web caching policies. The experiments based on three realistic web logs have proved the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the convergence of the caching and streaming technologies for Internet multimedia. The paper describes a design for a streaming and caching architecture to be deployed on broadband networks. The basis of the work is the proposed Internet standard, Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), likely to be the de-facto standard for web-based A/V caching and streaming, in the near future. The proxies are all managed by an `Intelligent Agent' or `Broker' - this has been designed as an enhanced RTSP proxy server that maintains the state information that is so essential in streaming of media data. In addition, all the caching algorithms run on the broker. Having an intelligent agent or broker ensures that the `simple' caching servers can be easily embedded into the network. However, RTSP does nor have the right model for doing broker based streaming/caching architecture. The work reported here is an attempt to contribute towards that end.},

abstract = {Large-scale, multi-point, multimedia conferencing applications designed to facilitate long-distance collaboration are enjoying growing popularity. Usually composed of real-time audio, video and shared-drawing applications, these collaborative environments help render the geographical location of collaborators irrelevant. To complement these existing collaborative applications, it would be useful to have the ability to distribute documents synchronously over the World Wide Web (WWW). One model for synchronized information dissemination within the Web is webcasting in which data are simultaneously distributed to multiple destinations. The WWW's traditional unicast client/server communication model suffers, however, when applied to webcasting; solutions which require many clients to simultaneously fetch data from the origin server using the client/server model will likely cause server and link overload.A number of webcasting solutions have been proposed. Many have limited scalability because they are based on unicast while others use multicast for more scalable data delivery but require server modification or have rigid architectures. We believe that successful webcasting solutions will provide scalable, reliable delivery yet still be compatible with the existing Web infrastructure.In this paper we describe a webcast design that improves upon previous designs by leveraging application level framing (ALF) design methodology. We build upon the Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) framework, which is based upon ALF, to create a custom protocol to meet webcast's scalability needs. We employ the protocol in an architecture consisting of two reusable components: a webcache component and a browser control component. We have implemented our design using the MASH multimedia application toolkit and a SRM protocol module called libsrm. We present the results of a simple performance evaluation and report on lessons learned while using MASH and libsrm.},

abstract = {The relevance feedback approach to image retrieval is a powerful technique and has been an active research direction for the past few years. Various ad hoc parameter estimation techniques have been proposed for relevance feedback. In addition, methods that perform optimization on multi-level image content model have been formulated. However, these methods only perform relevance feedback on the low-level image features and fail to address the images' semantic content. In this paper, we propose a relevance feedback technique, iFind, to take advantage of the semantic contents of the images in addition to the low-level features. By forming a semantic network on top of the keyword association on the images, we are able to accurately deduce and utilize the images' semantic contents for retrieval purposes. The accuracy and effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with experimental results on real-world image collections.},

abstract = {Images are increasingly being embedded in HTML documents on the WWW. Such documents over the WWW essentially provides a rich source of image collection from which user can query. Interestingly, the semantics of these images are typically described by their surrounding text. Unfortunately, most WWW image search engines fail to exploit these image semantics and give rise to poor recall and precision performance. In this paper, we propose a novel image representation model called Weight ChainNet. Weight ChainNet is based on lexical chain that represents the semantics of an image from its nearby text. A new formula, called list space model, for computing semantic similarities is also introduced. To further improve the retrieval   effectiveness, we also propose two relevance feedback mechanisms. We conducted an extensive performance study on a collection of 5000 images obtained from documents identified by more than 2000 URLs. Our results show that our models and methods outperform existing technique. Moreover, the relevant feedback mechanisms can lead to significantly better retrieval effectiveness.},

Simulations expose the significant performance gains attained by our proposed watermarking approach and reveal its exciting potential for next-generation watermarking techniques. This can be accredited to the exploitation of the dual roles played by source codes and channel codes in the two problems.},

We empirically evaluated the performance of content-based part of the proposed methods using preference data on TV programs consisting of scores given by people on actual TV programs. The results are largely encouraging and indicate in particular that our methods are practical in terms of both the precision in predicting the user's preference and computational complexity.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) currently lacks the kinds of sophisticated production technologies that are commonly available for established media such as video and audio. This paper introduces the idea of temporal links, which provide a flexible mechanism for replaying past or recent recordings of virtual environments within other real-time virtual environments. Their flexibility arises from a combination of temporal, spatial and presentational properties. Temporal properties determine the relationship between time in a live environment and time in a recording, including the apparent speed and direction of replay. Spatial properties determine the spatial relationship between the environment and the recording. Presentational properties determine the appearance of the recording within the environment. These properties may be fixed, dynamically varied by an application, or directly controlled in real-time by users. Consequently, temporal links have a wide variety of potential uses, including supporting post-production tools for virtual environments, post-exercise debriefing in training simulators, and asynchranous communication such as VR email, as well as providing new forms of content for virtual worlds that refer to past activity. We define temporal links and their properties and describe their implementation in the MASSIVE-3 Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) system, focusing on the underlying record and replay mechanisms. We also demonstrate applications for adding new content to an existing virtual world, and a VR post-production editor.},

It is also a very challenging problem requiring the detection and integration of evidence for an event available in multiple information modalities, such as audio, video and language. This paper focuses on the detection of specific types of events, namely, topic of discussion events that occur in classroom/lecture environments. Specifically, we present a query-driven approach to the detection of topic of discussion events with foils used in a lecture as a way to convey a topic. In particular, we use the image content of foils to detect visual events in which the foil is displayed and captured in the video stream. The recognition of a foil in video frames exploits the color and spatial layout of regions on foils using a technique called region hashing. Next, we use the textual phrases listed on a foil as an indication of a topic, and detect topical audio events as places in the audio track where the best evidence for the topical phrases was heard. Finally, we use a probabilistic model of event likelihood to combine the results of visual and audio avent detection that exploits their time cooccurrence. The resulting identification of topical events is evaluated in the domain of classroom lectures and talks.},

abstract = {In this paper we present novel algorithms for computing scenes and within-scene structures in films. We begin by mapping insights from film-making rules and experimental results from the psychology of audition into a computational scene model. We define a computable scene to be a chunk of audio-visual data that exhibits long-term consistency with regard to three properties: (a) chromaticity (b) lighting (c) ambient sound. Central to the computational model is the notion of a causal, finite-memory viewer model. We segment the audio and video data separately. In each case we determine the degree of correlation of the most recent data in the memory with the past. The respective scene boundaries are determined using local minima and aligned using a nearest neighbor algorithm. We introduce a periodic analysis transform to automatically determine the structure within a scene. We then use statistical tests on the transform to determine the presence of a dialogue. The algorithms were tested on a difficult data set: five commercial films. We take the first hour of data from each of the five films. The best results: scene detection: 88% recall and 72% precision, dialogue detection: 91% recall and 100% precision.},

Users desire the capability to watch the programs time-shifted (on-demand) and/or to watch just the highlights to save time. In this paper we explore how to provide for the latter capability, that is the ability to extract highlights automatically, so that viewing time can be reduced.We focus on the sport of baseball as our initial target—it is a very popular sport, the whole game is quite long, and the exciting portions are few. We focus on detecting highlights using audio-track features alone without relying on expensive-to-compute video-track features. We use a combination of generic sports features and baseball-specific features to obtain our results, but believe that may other sports offer the same opportunity and that the techniques presented here will apply to those sports. We present details on relative performance of various learning algorithms, and a probabilistic framework for combining multiple sources of information. We present results comparing output of our algorithms against human-selected highlights for a diverse collection of baseball games with very encouraging results.},

To avoid this, our approach is to admit whole multimedia sessions instead of single media streams. For the prediction of the varying resource demands within a session, which are mainly correlated to user behavior, we model user behavior as Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). In this paper, we propose a mathematical analysis of the CTMC model. This allows to anticipate possible overload and in turn to plan an admission control policy. As a result, our approach provides better control on the tradeoff between server utilization and QoS. Simulation studies confirm this capability.},

We present QLinux—a multimedia operating system based on the Linux kernel that meets this requirement. QLinux employs hierarchical schedulers for fair, predictable allocation of processor, disk and network bandwidth, and accounting mechanisms for appropriate charging of resource usage. We experimentally evaluate the efficacy of these mechanisms using benchmarks and real-world applications. Our experimental results show that (i) emerging applications can indeed benefit from predictable allocation of resources, and (ii) the overheads imposed by the resource allocation mechanisms in QLinux are small. For instance, we show that the QLinux CPU scheduler can provide predictable performance guarantees to applications such as web servers and MPEG players, albeit at the expense of increasing the scheduling overhead. We conclude from our experiments that the benefits due to the resource management mechanisms in QLinux outweigh their increased overheads, making them a practical choice for conventional operating systems.},

The targeted image retrieval systems represent an image by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by features reflecting color, texture, shape, and location properties. The IRM measure for evaluating overall similarity between images incorporates properties of all the regions in the images by a region-matching scheme. Compared with retrieval based on individual regions, the overall similarity approach reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation, helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval systems. The IRM has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system. The application to a database of about 200,000 general-purpose images shows exceptional robustness to image alterations such as intensity variation, sharpness variation, color distortions, shape distortions, cropping, shifting, and rotation. Compared with several existing systems, our system in general achieves more accurate retrieval at higher speed.},

In this framework, methods for extracting comprehensive image features are provided, which are based on the frequency of representative blocks, termed keyblocks, of the image database. Keyblocks, which are analogous to index terms in text document retrieval, can be constructed by exploiting the vector quantization (VQ) method which has been used for image compression. By comparing the performance of our approach with the existing techniques using color feature and wavelet texture feature, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in image retrieval.},

The labels that are extracted in this case are man-made, natural, inside and outside. The hierarchical framework combines class likelihood probability estimates across a number of levels to form a posterior estimate of the probability of class membership. Unlike previous work in this field, the proposed algorithm can determine probabilities at any point in the scene and only a small number of images are required to train the system. To illustrate the potential of such an approach a prototype image retrieval system has been developed, initial results from this system are given in this paper.},

abstract = {We have designed a graphical interface that enables 3D visual artists or developers of interactive 3D virtual environments to efficiently define sophisticated camera compositions by creating storyboard frames, indicating how a desired shot should appear. These storyboard frames are then automatically encoded into an extensive set of virtual camera constraints that capture the key visual composition elements of the storyboard frame. Visual composition elements include the size and position of a subject in a camera shot. A recursive heuristic constraint solver then searches the space of a given 3D virtual environment to determine camera parameter values which produce a shot closely matching the one in the given storyboard frame. The search method uses given ranges of allowable parameter values expressed by each constraint to reduce the size of the 7 Degree of Freedom search space of possible camera positions, aim direction vectors, and field of view angles. In contrast, some existing methods of automatically positioning cameras in 3D virtual environments rely on pre-defined camera placements that cannot account for unanticipated configurations and movement of objects or use program-like scripts to define constraint-based camera shots. For example, it is more intuitive to directly manipulate an object's size in the frame rather than editing a constraint script to specify that the object should cover 10% of the frame's area.},

This research provide an interaction framework that seeks to address these requirements. In particular, the system allows players and spectators to exchange messages during the performance. These messages describe player actions and audience reactions. Furthermore, the framework monitors the development of the event and analyzes the behavior of the participants in order to: (i) detect and render shared audience reactions (ii) achieve a high degree of audience engagement. Finally, the system synchronizes the presentation of audience reactions with performance developments at each site. This method has been applied in MISSION, a multi-player game on the Web.},

However, the huge amount of data associated with concentric mosaics is a heavy burden for its application. A 3D wavelet transform-based compressor has been proposed in previous work to compress the concentric mosaics. In this paper, we greatly improve the performance of the 3D wavelet coder with a data rearrangement mechanism called “smart rebinning”. The proposed scheme first aligns the concentric mosaic image shots along the horizontal direction and then rebins the shots into multi-perspective panoramas. Smart rebinning greatly improves the cross shot correlation and enables the coder to better explore the redundancy among shots. Experimental results show that the performance of the 3D wavelet coder improves an average of 4.3dB with the use of smart rebinning. The proposed coder outperforms MPEG-2 coding of concentric mosaics by an average of 3.7dB.},

abstract = {The (cinema) caption processing that adds descriptive texts on the sequence of frames is an important video manipulation function that video editor should support. This paper proposes an efficient MC-DCT compressed domain approach to insert the caption into the MPEG-compressed video stream. It basically adds the DCT blocks of the caption image to the corresponding DCT blocks of the input frames one by one in MC-DCT domain as in [5]. However, the strength of the caption image is adjusted in the DCT domain to prevent the resulting DCT coefficients from exceeding the maximum value that is allowed in MPEG. In order to adjust the strength of caption image adaptively, we should know the exact pixel values of input image that is a difficult task in DCT domain. We propose an approximation scheme for the pixel values in which the DC value of a block is used as the expected pixel value for all pixels in that block. Although this approximation may lead some errors in the caption area, it still provides a relatively high image quality in the non-caption area, while the processing time is about 4.9 times faster than the decode-captioning-reencode approach.},

In our detailed study of these gradual shot transitions, our objective has been to accurately classify the type of transitions (fade-in, fade-out, and dissolve) and to precisely locate the boundary of the transitions. This distinguishes our work from other early work in scene change detection which tends to focus primarily on identifying the existence of a transition rather than its precise temporal extent. We evaluate our improved algorithms against two other commonly used shot detection techniques on a comprehensive data set, and demonstrate the improved performance due to our enhancements.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new multiple access control (MAC) protocol for wireless distributed multimedia systems based on ATM, in which user demands are highly heterogeneous and can be classified as CBR, VBR, and ABR. Our protocol is motivated by two of the most significant drawbacks of existing protocols: (1) channel condition is ignored or not exploited, and (2) inflexible or biased time slots allocation algorithms are used. Indeed, existing protocols mostly ignore the burst errors due to fading and shadowing, which are inevitable in a mobile and wireless communication environment. A few protocols take into account the burst errors but just “handle” the errors in a passive manner. On the other hand, most of the existing protocols employ an inflexible or biased allocation algorithm such that over-provisioning may occur for a certain class of users at the expense of the poor service quality received by other users. Our proposed protocol, called SCAMA (synergistic channel adaptive multiple access), does not have these two drawbacks. The proposed protocol works closely with the underlying physical layer in that through observing the channel state information (CSI) of each mobile user, the MAC protocol first segregates a set of users with good CSI from requests gathered in the request contention phase of an uplink frame. The MAC protocol then judiciously allocates information time slots to the users according to their traffic types, CSI, urgency, and throughput, which are collectively represented by a novel and flexible priority function.},

abstract = {The explosive increase in the volume and variety of Internet traffic has placed a growing emphasis on congestion control and fairness in Internet routers. Approaches to the problem of congestion, such as active queue management schemes like Random Early Detection (RED) use congestion avoidance techniques and are successful with TCP flows. Approaches to the problem of fairness, such as Fair Random Early Drop (FRED), keep per-flow state and punish misbehaved, non-TCP flows. Unfortunately, these punishment mechanisms also result in a significant performance drop for multimedia flows that use flow control. We extend Class-Based Threshold (CRT) [12], and propose a new active queue management mechanism as an extension to RED called Dynamic Class-Based Threshold (D- CBT) to improve multimedia performance on the Internet. Also, as an effort to reduce multimedia jitter, we propose a lightweight packet scheduling called Cut-In Packet Scheduling (ChIPS) as an alternative to FIFO packet scheduling. The performance of our proposed mechanisms is measured, analyzed and compared with other mechanisms (RED and CBT) in terms of throughput, fairness and multimedia jitter through simulation using NS. The study shows that D-CBT improves fairness among different classes of flows and ChIPS improves multimedia jitter without degrading fairness.},

abstract = {The limitation of the current multicast model led to the development of embedded network assist and new service models for reliable transport. We show a viable solution for one of the hardest problems in reliable multicast — congestion control — through the deployment of a new forwarding service model, “Breadcrumb forwarding service” (BCFS). Our proposed reliable multicast transport, “Rainbow”, is built on top of this model. In our approach, each receiver maintains its own congestion window and individually runs window control modeled after TCP. To enhance Rainbow's scalability and support asynchronous receiver subscriptions, Rainbow utilizes Digital Fountain at the source. This allows receivers to exercise asynchronous and autonomous behavior while simultaneously enjoying the performance benefit of synchronous multicast communication with fast group establishment of BCFS. In this paper, we detail the congestion control of Rainbow and demonstrate its efficiency and scalability through simulation and analysis. According to simulation results, Rainbow shows more TCP-fair behavior than RLC, which is a TCP friendly congestion control scheme based on layered multicast.},

This requires that the shared state of the medium is transmitted from the old participants of the session to the latecomer in an efficient and scalable way. In order to be generic and useful for a broad range of distributed interactive media, we have implemented the late-join service based on the Real Time Application Level Protocol for Distributed Interactive Media (RTP/I). All applications which employ this protocol can also use the generic late-join service. Furthermore the late-join service can be adapted to the specific needs of a given application by specifying policies for the late-join process. Applications which do use a different application level protocol than RTP/I may still use the concepts presented in this work. However, they will not be able to profit from our RTP/I based implementation.},

A subsequent analysis of conference recordings found that in most cases, the impairment was caused by end-system hardware, equipment setup or user behavior. The results from the experiment confirm that the effects of volume differences, echo and bad microphones are rated worse than the level of packet loss most users are likely to experience on the Internet today, provided that a simple repair mechanism is used. Consequently, anyone designing or deploying network speech applications and services ought to consider the addition of diagnostics and tutorials to ensure acceptable speech quality.},

Secondly, we compare image patterns with a varying pose face model in terms of shape and texture differences, using a combined feature-texture similarity measure (FTSM). False detections from the first stage are eliminated by setting an appropriate FTSM threshold. Moreover, one can also register the facial features (eyes, nose and mouth) by aligning a prototype face with the unknown pose faces. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve reliable face detection and feature registration under various conditions, including different poses, face appearances, and lighting conditions.},

Thus, key-frame based video abstraction transforms an entire video clip to a small number of representative images. The challenge is that the extraction of key-frames needs to be automated and context dependent so that they maintain the important contents of the video while remove all redundancy. Among various semantic primitives of video, objects of interest along with their actions and generated events can play an important role in some applications such as object-based video surveillance system. Furthermore, on-line processing combined with fast and robust video object segmentation is crucial for real-time applications to report unwanted action or event as soon as it happens.

abstract = {Content based indexing of multimedia has always been a challenging task. The enormity and the diversity of the multimedia content on the web adds another dimension to this challenge. In this paper, we examine ways of combining visual and textual information for content based indexing of multimedia on the web. In particular, we examine different methods of combining evidences due to face detection, Text/HTML analysis and face recognition for identifying person images. We provide experimental evaluation of the following strategies: i) Face detection on the image followed by Text/HTML analysis of the containing page; ii) face detection followed by face recognition; iii) face detection followed by a linear combination of evidences due to text/HTML analysis and face recognition; and iv) face detection followed by a Dempster-Shafer combination of evidences due to text/HTML analysis and face recognition. These strategies were implemented in an automatic web search agent named Diogenes1 and compared against some well known web image search engines. The latter includes commercial systems such as Alta Vista, Lycos and Ditto, and a research prototype, WebSEEk. We report the results of our experimental retrievals where Diogenes outperformed these search engines for celebrity image queries in terms of average precision.},

abstract = {In recent years, small screen devices, such as cellular phones or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), enjoy phenomenal popularity. PDAs can be used to complement traditional computing systems to access personal multimedia information beyond the usage as digital organizers. However, due to the physical limitations accessing rich multimedia contents and diverse services using a single PDA is more difficult. Hence, the Situated Computing Framework (SCF) research project at Siemens Corporate Research (SCR) aims to develop a ubiquitous computing infrastructure that facilitates nomadic users to access rich multimedia contents using small screen devices. This paper describes a new distributed computing concept, the Small Screen/Composite Device (SS/CD) framework, which offers mobile users new classes of ubiquitous and mobile multimedia services without to limit the diversity and the richness of the provided services.},

abstract = {A music retrieval system that accepts hummed tunes as queries is described in this paper. This system uses similarity retrieval because a hummed tune may contain errors. The retrieval result is a list of song names ranked according to the closeness of the match. Our ultimate goal is that the correct song should be first on the list. This means that eventually our system's similarity retrieval should allow for only one correct answer.The most significant improvement our system has over general query-by-humming systems is that all processing of musical information is done based on beats instead of notes. This type of query processing is robust against queries generated from erroneous input. In addition, acoustic information is transcribed and converted into relative intervals and is used for making feature vectors. This increases the resolution of the retrieval system compared with other general systems, which use only pitch direction information.The database currently holds over 10,000 songs, and the retrieval time is at most one second. This level of performance is mainly achieved through the use of indices for retrieval. In this paper, we also report on the results of music analyses of the songs in the database. Based on these results, new technologies for improving retrieval accuracy, such as partial feature vectors and or'ed retrieval among multiple search keys, are proposed. The effectiveness of these technologies is evaluated quantitatively, and it is found that the retrieval accuracy increases by more than 20% compared with the previous system [9]. Practical user interfaces for the system are also described.},

Initial assessment of tempo was performed in our study on the basis that the relative importance of both shot length and motion in formulating the tempo function was the same. In this paper, we analyze their relative contributions to tempo, and demonstrate how these two factors can be manipulated to influence audience perception of movie time.},

abstract = {Video-on-demand (VoD) has been an active area of research for the past few years in the multimedia research community. However, there have not been many significant commercial deployments of VoD owing to the inadequacy of per user bandwidth and the lack of a good business model.1 Significant research efforts have been directed towards reduction of network bandwidth requirements, improvement of server utilization, and minimization of start-up latency. In this paper, we investigate another aspect of VoD systems which has been largely neglected by the research community, namely, pricing models for VoD systems. We believe that the price charged to a user for an on-demand video stream should influence the rate of user arrivals into the VoD system and in turn should depend upon quality-of-service (QoS) factors such as initial start-up latency. We briefly describe some simple pricing models and analyze the tradeoffs involved in such scenarios from a profit maximization point of view. We further explore secondary content insertion (ad-insertion) which was proposed elsewhere [1] not only as a technique for reducing the resource requirements at the server and the network, but also as a means of subsidizing VoD content to the end user. We treat the rate of ad insertion as another QoS factor and demonstrate how it can influence the price of movie delivery.},

abstract = {We develop a new low-dimensional video frame feature that is more insensitive to lighting change, motivated by color constancy work in physics-based vision, and apply the feature to keyframe production using hierarchical clustering. The new feature has the further advantage of more expressively capturing image information and as a result produces a very succinct set of keyframes for any video. Because we effectively reduce any video to the same lighting conditions, we can produce a universal basis on which to project video frame features. We carry out clustering efficiently by adapting a hierarchical clustering data structure to temporally-ordered clusters. Using a new multi-stage hierarchical clustering method, we merge clusters based on the ratio of cluster variance to variance of the parent node, merging only adjacent clusters, and then follow with a second round of clustering. The second stage merges clusters incorrectly split in the first round by the greedy hierarchical algorithm, and as well merges non-adjacent clusters to fuse near-repeat shots. The new summarization method produces a very succinct set of keyframes for videos, and results are excellent.},

The FSF is an extensible set of classes that provide basic synchronization functionality and composition mechanisms to develop data-stream processing components. In this dataflow approach, applications are implemented by specifying data streams and their path through processing nodes, where they can undergo various manipulations. We describe the details of the FSF data and processing model that supports stream synchronization in a concurrent processing framework.

Dealing with multiple inputs poses many challenging problems for both their combination and the low-level translation needed to transform an acoustic signal into a symbolic representation.

Dissolve effect, among the various gradual transition effects, is one of the most frequently used shot transition methods with special semantic meaning such as scene transition. Information of the shot change type can also be the basis for the shot clustering algorithms. In this paper, we present a fast and effective dissolve-transition detection algorithm based on the spatio-temporal distribution of the macro block pipes in MPEG-compressed video. In the proposed algorithm, the ratio of forward macro blocks in the B-type frames and the spatial distribution of forward/backward macro blocks are utilized for detecting dissolve transition. After finding such sequence of frames, we apply 2 heuristic rules: (1) The global color distributions of the frames at which dissolve starts and terminates are very different, and (2) The duration of dissolve transition is typically more than 0.3 second.},

abstract = {We present image compression method based on block palletizing. Image block is partitioned into four subsets, and each subset is palletized by 2 or 4 colors from the quasioptimal local palette, constructed for the whole block. Index map for the whole block, being the union of index maps for subsets, is thus only 1 or 2 bits deep, while the local palette may consist of 8 or even 16 colors. The local palette has a specific geometrical configuration in RGB color space, determined by only 2 colors. These two colors are stored explicitly, and the rest are reconstructed at the decompression stage. Compressed block consists, essentially, of the index map, palette description and partition description. This format allows fast access to randomly chosen pixels, and high reconstruction quality for compression ratios from 8 to 12, which is useful for texture storage in 3D graphics applications where real-time decompression is crucial.},

The JIADL system can support diverse asynchronous distance learning services. Unlike most related work in the literature, we integrate RealPlayer and Java technology so that the superiority of both models can be complemented. A course sample is illustrated to validate the effectiveness of the paradigm proposed. How to use the proposed multimedia ATN model to model the diverse requirements of a distance learning multimedia presentation is also discussed. The multimedia ATN model is powerful in modeling the asynchronization for distance learning multimedia presentations. Furthermore, in addition to supporting asynchronous distance learning, our system can be applied to a wide range of potential value-added applications.},

abstract = {The increase of bandwidth and streaming technology has made video on the Web the current “killer-app” of the dot-com world. However, users still face many problems. Users have to find the right video and the right segment within the video. Locally stored files provide easy (but still not very sophisticated) access to individual points in the video by utilizing a seek slider. If the video is streamed over the Internet, this slider loses much of its attraction. Every accessed point in the video requires the video player to buffer, which causes a time lag.The mediacaptain is a system that addresses this issue by using supplementary material like text and graphics to provide indices. This time-aligned material is used to help the user make an informed decision on whether they want to watch a video and if so, what portions. This web-enabled prototype called mediacaptain emerged from user surveys and is demonstrated on several content types and represents an advanced experience with video on the Web.},

abstract = {The two-layered distributed clustered server architecture consisting of a control server and a group of storage servers has been widely used to support multimedia file systems. With this kind of the server architecture, it is easy to sustain disk load balancing and scalable disk bandwidth. However, it brings about the communication overhead between the control server and storage servers. Therefore, to reduce such overhead, media data should be transmitted from the storage servers to the users directly without the intervention of the control server. In addition, the file system must support the effective data placement and disk scheduling policies and should be designed to sustain portability and flexibility in any hardware or software environment to cope with rapidly developed hardware and software technologies.So, to fulfill such requirements described in the above statements, we designed and implemented a parallel file system named PMFS(Parallel Multimedia File System) and analyzed its performance by comparing it with PVFS(Parallel Virtual File System). As a result of our experimental simulation, we came to conclusion that the PMFS shows better performance than the PVFS does in real time data processing.},

This ANN is used to find a collection of skin regions, which is used in a second learning step to provide parameters for a Gaussian mixture model. A finer classification is performed using a Bayesian framework and makes the skin and face detection invariant to scale and lighting conditions. Finally, a face shape based model is used to decide whether a skin region is a face or not.},

One important breakthrough of this model is that it is a scheduling graph that provides the control of the occurrence of non-deterministic events, such as user interactions, within valid temporal intervals so that the global synchronization constraints of the document can be fulfilled during its presentation. Further on, some scheduling policies are also presented based on this model. Finally, we introduce some characteristics of the player actually available for the presentation of IMDs based on this new model.},

In this paper we propose a two phase approach to the problem. In the first phase, latent semantic analysis is used to associate metadata available for some media objects with concept class descriptions. This facilitate automatic associations to be made with the concept layer of the those media objects. In the second phase, media content matching is used to classify media objects without metadata through their similarity to media objects classified in phase 1.},

abstract = {The most commonly used method for content-based video retrieval is query by example. But the definition of video similarity brings great obstacle to further research. This paper puts forward a new approach to solve the difficulty. Firstly, it advances centroid feature vector of shot in order to reduce the storage of video database. Secondly, considering all the factors existing in human vision perception, it introduces a new comparison algorithm based on multi-granularity of video structure, which has great flexibility. Thirdly, after getting the similar video set, we take a brand-new method of feedback to adjust weight based on video similarity model. In this way, retrieval result can be optimized greatly.},

abstract = {This research aims to explore possible solutions to improvement of performance in multimedia processor [1]. In this context, cache memory performance plays a more and more critical role in computer systems, since the gap between processor speed and main memory speed tends to increase rather than the contrary. The integration inside the computational units of some SIMD improvements (such as Pentium MMX, HP MAX2 or UltraSparc VIS) for improving the parallel computation on image pixels is the main answer to the heavy workloads of multimedia applications [2]. Moreover, the workload of multimedia applications [3] has a strong impact on cache memory performance, since the locality of memory references embedded in multimedia programs differs from that of traditional programs. In fact, as widely known, programs exhibit two main kind of locality: spatial and temporal. Nevertheless, as stated in [1], multimedia applications seem to present a new kind of locality, called 2D-spatial locality (i.e. there is an high probability that accessing to an address, future accesses will be in a bidimensional neighborhood of it). For this reason, standard cache memory organization achieves poorer performance when used for multimedia. To achieve an overall performance improvement on specialized multimedia processors, further architectural modification on memory hierarchy and on its management should be fulfilled. This could be coupled with the recent idea of associating programmable components with memory separated from the main processor, such as IRAM [4].First goal of this research is to prove that common multimedia applications exhibit a 2D-spatial locality. To do this, we developed a benchmark including the most common multimedia and image processing applications. Many trace-driven simulations confirm the hypothesis [5][6].After this, we try to explore techniques able to exploit this locality to improve cache performance. Among the various techniques used to improve cache memory performance, prefetching has been one of the most studied and apparently promising (see [7][8], where, however, no assumption on 2D spatial locality is highlighted). Prefetching techniques can be mainly classified according to their potential software or hardware implementation, although some techniques may take advantage of a combined software/hardware implementation [9]. A widely explored approach to improve cache performance is hardware prefetching that allows the pre-loading of data in the cache before they are referenced. However, existing hardware prefetching approaches partially miss the potential performance improvement, since they are not tailored to multimedia locality. In this research we are proposing novel effective approaches to hardware prefetching to be used in image processing programs for multimedia. In particular, we have addressed multimedia image processing, where we have included algorithms like the widespread MPEG-2 decoding used for decompression of audio/video streams and typical image processing operations like convolution for image filtering and edge chain coding, used as a pre-processing step in many image analysis tasks. We have omitted evaluation on sound data (like MP3 decompression or speech recognition), since they exhibit typical array spatial locality and standard prefetching techniques perform well enough. Algorithms have been selected according to their spread and their different data addressing schemes: while convolution is dominated by a regular data addressing scheme which can be predicted a priori, edge chain coding is heavily data dependent, in the sense that the address sequence of data references depends on the image and cannot be statically predicted: for example, in this case software prefetching techniques (based on compile-time prediction of future accesses) are not suitable. MPEG-2 exhibits a combination of regular address scheme and data dependency.Typical hardware prefetching techniques are not suitable in this context: techniques based on one-block-lookahead [10] exploit only 1D spatial locality, while adaptive techniques do not match data dependency of some image processing algorithms.},

The system, based on wavelets, the IRM (Integrated Region Matching) distance, and image classification, is highly robust to inacurate image segmentation and various visual alterations.

abstract = {Multimedia presentations are increasingly being used in most spheres of life. Viewing these multimedia presentation as databases help in querying as well as re-using parts of existing presentations to create new ones. This dissertation proposes on object-oriented model for mangaging multimedia presentations as (temporal) databases based on the web. And the dissertation also discusses the representation of the proposed object-oriented model in Extensible Markup Language (XML). This represented opens up the possibility of employing standard XML product to commit multimedia presentation application over Internet, using the object-oriented model. Most major features such as run-time query arousing, unknown-duration objects control and interdatabase links are captured by the XML representation in the dissertation.},
