abstract = {How can micro-blogging activities on Twitter be leveraged for user modeling and personalization? In this paper we investigate this question and introduce a framework for user modeling on Twitter which enriches the semantics of Twitter messages (tweets) and identifies topics and entities (e.g. persons, events, products) mentioned in tweets. We analyze how strategies for constructing hashtag-based, entity-based or topic-based user profiles benefit from semantic enrichment and explore the temporal dynamics of those profiles. We further measure and compare the performance of the user modeling strategies in context of a personalized news recommendation system. Our results reveal how semantic enrichment enhances the variety and quality of the generated user profiles. Further, we see how the different user modeling strategies impact personalization and discover that the consideration of temporal profile patterns can improve recommendation quality.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, there have been a rich variety of approaches towards modeling student knowledge and skill within interactive learning environments. There have recently been several empirical comparisons as to which types of student models are better at predicting future performance, both within and outside of the interactive learning environment. However, these comparisons have produced contradictory results. Within this paper, we examine whether ensemble methods, which integrate multiple models, can produce prediction results comparable to or better than the best of nine student modeling frameworks, taken individually. We ensemble model predictions within a Cognitive Tutor for Genetics, at the level of predicting knowledge action-by-action within the tutor. We evaluate the predictions in terms of future performance within the tutor and on a paper post-test. Within this data set, we do not find evidence that ensembles of models are significantly better. Ensembles of models perform comparably to or slightly better than the best individual models, at predicting future performance within the tutor software. However, the ensembles of models perform marginally significantly worse than the best individual models, at predicting post-test performance.},

abstract = {Our bodies shape our experience of the world, and our bodies influence what we design. How important are the physical differences between people? Can we model the physiological differences and use the models to adapt and personalize designs, user interfaces and artifacts? Within many disciplines Digital Human Models and Standard Observer Models are widely used and have proven to be very useful for modeling users and simulating humans. In this paper, we create personalized digital human models of perception (Individual Observer Models), particularly focused on how humans see. Individual Observer Models capture how our bodies shape our perceptions. Individual Observer Models are useful for adapting and personalizing user interfaces and artifacts to suit individual users' bodies and perceptions. We introduce and demonstrate an Individual Observer Model of human eyesight, which we use to simulate 3600 biologically valid human eyes. An evaluation of the simulated eyes finds that they see eye charts the same as humans. Also demonstrated is the Individual Observer Model successfully making predictions about how easy or hard it is to see visual information and visual designs. The ability to predict and adapt visual information to maximize how effective it is is an important problem in visual design and analytics.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine a challenge that arises in the application of peer-based tutoring: coping with inappropriate advice from peers. We examine an environment where students are presented with those learning objects predicted to improve their learning (on the basis of the success of previous, like-minded students) but where peers can additionally inject annotations. To avoid presenting annotations that would detract from student learning (e.g. those found confusing by other students) we integrate trust modeling, to detect over time the reputation of the annotation (as voted by previous students) and the reputability of the annotator. We empirically demonstrate, through simulation, that even when the environment is populated with a large number of poor annotations, our algorithm for directing the learning of the students is effective, confirming the value of our proposed approach for student modeling. In addition, the research introduces a valuable integration of trust modeling into educational applications.},

abstract = {The open nature of exploratory learning leads to situations when feedback is needed to address several conceptual difficulties. Not all, however, can be addressed at the same time, as this would lead to cognitive overload and confuse the learner rather than help him/her. To this end, we propose a personalised context-dependent feedback prioritisation mechanism based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neural Networks (NN). AHP is used to define feedback prioritisation as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, while NN is used to model the relation between the criteria and the order in which the conceptual difficulties should be addressed. When used alone, AHP needs a large amount of data from experts to cover all possible combinations of the criteria, while the AHP-NN synergy leads to a general model that outputs results for any such combination. This work was developed and tested in an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation called eXpresser.},

abstract = {Assessing a learner's mastery of a set of skills is a fundamental issue in intelligent learning environments. We compare the predictive performance of two approaches for training a learner model with domain data. One is based on the principle of building the model solely from observable data items, such as exercises or test items. Skills modelling is not part of the training phase, but instead dealt with at later stage. The other approach incorporates a single latent skill in the model. We compare the capacity of both approaches to accurately predict item outcome (binary success or failure) from a subset of item outcomes. Three types of item-to-item models based on standard Bayesian modeling algorithms are tested: (1) Naive Bayes, (2) Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), and (3) a K2 Bayesian Classifier. Their performance is compared to the widely used IRT-2PL approach which incorporates a single latent skill. The results show that the item-to-item approaches perform as well, or better than the IRT-2PL approach over 4 widely different data sets, but the differences vary considerably among the data sets. We discuss the implications of these results and the issues relating to the practical use of item-to-item models.},

The models can represent topics of interest for the user based on the subject or content of visited locations, and corresponding location models can enable matching between users and locations. However, virtual worlds also present challenges and opportunities that differ from hypertext worlds. Content collection for a cross-world search and recommendation service may be more difficult in virtual worlds, and there is less text available for analysis. In some cases, though, extra information is available to add to user and content profiles enhance the matching ability of the system. In this paper, we present a content collection system for Second Life and OpenSimulator virtual worlds, as well as user and location models derived from the collected content. The models incorporate text, social proximity, and metadata attributes to create hybrid user models for representing user interests and preferences. The models are evaluated based on their ability to match content popularity and observed user behavior.},

These tools require an understanding of user reasoning as well as user needs and are ideal application areas for recommender and personalization technologies. Here, we report on a large scale analysis of real user ratings on a set of recipes in order to judge the applicability and practicality of a number of personalization algorithms. Further to this, we report on apparent user reasoning patterns uncovered in rating data supplied for recipes and suggest ways to exploit this reasoning understanding in the recommendation process.},

abstract = {Student modeling plays an important role in educational research. Many techniques have been developed focusing on accurately estimating student performances. In this paper, using Performance Factors Analysis as our framework, we examine what components of the model enable us to better predict, and consequently better understand, student performance. Using transfer models to predict is very common across different student modeling techniques, as student proficiencies on those required skills are believed, to a large degree, to determine student performance. However, we found that problem difficulty is an even more important predictor than student knowledge of the required skills. In addition, we found that using student proficiencies across all skills works better than just using those skills thought relevant by the transfer model. We tested our proposed models with two transfer models of fine- and coarse-grain sizes; the results suggest that the improvement is not simply an illusion due to possible mistakes in associating skills with problems.},

More specifically, this paper provides a detailed description of an algorithm developed to predict which paragraphs of text in a hypertext document have been read, and to which extent.

abstract = {Competence management systems are increasingly based on ontologies representing competences within a certain domain. Most of these systems represent a user's competence profile by means of an ontological structure. Such semantic competence profiles, often structured as a hierarchy of competences, are difficult to navigate for self-assessment purposes. The more competences a user profile holds, the more challenging the comprehensive presentation of profile data is. In this paper, we present an integrated user interface that supports users during competence self-assessment and facilitates a clear presentation of their semantic competence profiles. For evaluation, we conducted a usability study with 19 students at university. The results show that users were mostly satisfied with the usability of the interface that also represents a promising approach for efficient competence self-assessment.},

The system was evaluated in a semester-long classroom study. While the use of the system was non-mandatory, the parallel IntrospectiveViews interface caused an increase in all of the usage parameters in comparison to a regular portal-based access, which allowed the student to achieve a higher success rate in answering the questions.

To address this problem we have used emotional tags attached by a users' population to both music and POIs. Moreover, we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not. The results of the experiment show that there is a strong overlap between the users' selections and the best matching music that is recommended by the system for a POI.},

For tailoring search results, in this paper, we look into the potential of social tagging in social media services. By leveraging collaborative filtering, we propose a new search model to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. Our approach first computes latent preferences of users on tags from other similar users, as well as latent annotations of tags for items from other similar items. We then apply the latency of tags to a tag-based personalized ranking depending on individual users.

This paper describes our theoretical model of collaborative learning and how we implemented it. We use the Gini coefficient as a statistical indicator of symmetry of activity, which is itself an important indicator of collaboration. We built this model from a small-scale qualitative study based on concept mapping at an interactive tabletop. We then evaluated the model using a larger scale study based on a corpus of coded data from a multi-display groupware collocated setting. Our key contributions are the model of symmetry of activity as a foundation for modelling collaboration within groups that should have egalitarian participation, the operationalisation of the model and validation of the approach on both a small-scale qualitative study and a larger scale quantitative corpus of data.},

Using our approach we have generated a model to compare both approaches. Experiments with public datasets show that our method, employing simpler models, is able to accurately recognize the activities, using fewer instances, and obtains better results than the approaches used by the datasets authors.},

In this paper, we explore approaches to identify potential experts as early as within the first two weeks of their association with the QA. We look at users' behavior and estimate their motivation and ability to help others. These qualities enable us to build classification and ranking models to identify users who are likely to become experts in the future. Our results indicate that the current experts can be effectively identified from their early behavior. We asked community managers to evaluate the potential experts identified by our algorithm and their analysis revealed that quite a few of these users were already experts or on the path of becoming experts. Our retrospective analysis shows that some of these potential experts had already left the community, highlighting the value of early identification and engagement.},

While this model has shown positive gains over KT in internal validation testing, it has not performed well relative to KT on unseen in-tutor data or post-test data, however, it has proven a valuable model to use alongside other models. The contextual guess and slip model increases the complexity of KT by adding regression steps and feature generation. The added complexity of feature generation across datasets may have hindered the performance of this model. Therefore, one of the aims of our work here is to make the most minimal of modifications to the KT model in order to add item difficulty and keep the modification limited to changing the topology of the model. We analyze datasets from two intelligent tutoring systems with KT and a model we have called KT-IDEM (Item Difficulty Effect Model) and show that substantial performance gains can be achieved with this minor modification that incorporates item difficulty.},

abstract = {Most of the approaches for understanding user preferences or taste are based on having explicit feedback from users. However, in many real-life situations we need to rely on implicit feedback. To analyze the relation between implicit and explicit feedback, we conduct a user experiment in the music domain. We find that there is a strong relation between implicit feedback and ratings. We analyze the effect of context variables on the ratings and find that recentness of interaction has a significant effect. We also analyze several user variables. Finally, we propose a simple linear model that relates these variables to the rating we can expect to an item. Such mapping would allow to easily adapt any existing approach that uses explicit feedback to the implicit case and combine both kinds of feedback.},

abstract = {This paper explores ways to address the problem of the high cost problem of poor recommendations in reciprocal recommender systems. These systems recommend one person to another and require that both people like each other for the recommendation to be successful. A notable example, and the focus of our experiments is online dating. In such domains, poor recommendations should be avoided as they cause users to suffer repeated rejection and abandon the site. This paper describes our experiments to create a recommender based on two classes of models: one to predict who each user will like; the other to predict who each user will dislike. We then combine these models to generate recommendations for the user. This work is novel in exploring modelling both people's likes and dislikes and how to combine these to support a reciprocal recommendation, which is important for many domains, including online dating, employment, mentor-mentee matching and help-helper matching. Using a negative and a positive preference model in a combined manner, we improved the success rate of reciprocal recommendations by 18% while, at the same time, reducing the failure rate by 36% for the top-1 recommendations in comparison to using the positive model of preference alone.},

We then provide an analysis, drawn from a real-world study on an existing ride, which illustrates the efficacy of psychometric profiling and physiological monitoring in relation to these challenges. We conclude by discussing further research work that could be carried out within the theme park, but motivate this research by considering the broader contribution to user-modeling issues that it could make. As such, we present the theme park as a microcosm which is amenable to research, but which is relevant in a much broader setting.},

Users can create and share repositories of search knowledge (so-called search staks) in order to benefit from the searches of friends and colleagues. As such search staks are community-based information resources. A key challenge for HeyStaks is predicting which search stak is most relevant to the users current search context and in this paper we focus on this so-called stak recommendation issue by looking at a number of different approaches to profling and recommending community-search knowledge.},

abstract = {Recommender systems generally face the challenge of making predictions using only the relatively few user ratings available for a given domain. Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CF) aims to alleviate the effects of this data sparseness by transferring knowledge from other domains. We propose a novel algorithm, Tag-induced Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (TagCDCF), which exploits user-contributed tags that are common to multiple domains in order to establish the cross-domain links necessary for successful cross-domain CF. TagCDCF extends the state-of-the-art matrix factorization by introducing a constraint involving tag-based similarities between pairs of users and pairs of items across domains. The method requires no common users or items across domains. Using two publicly available CF data sets as different domains, we experimentally demonstrate that TagCDCF substantially outperforms other state-of-the-art single domain CF and cross-domain CF approaches. Additional experiments show that TagCDCF addresses data sparseness and illustrate the influence of the number of tags used by users in both domains.},

It addresses potential problems with user model selection and evaluation, that are often clear to expert modelers, but are not obvious for others. These problems are frequently a result of a falsely straightforward application of statistics to user modeling (e.g. over-reliance on model fit metrics). In such cases, absolute trust in arguably shallow model accuracy measures could lead to selecting models that are hard-to-interpret, less meaningful, over-fit, and less generalizable. We offer a list of questions to consider in order to avoid these modeling pitfalls.

abstract = {The success of online social networking systems has revolutionised online sharing and communication, however it has also contributed significantly to the infamous information overload problem. Social Networking systems aggregate network activities into chronologically ordered lists, Network Feeds, as a way of summarising network activity for its users. Unfortunately, these feeds do not take into account the interests of the user viewing them or the relevance of each feed item to the viewer. Consequently individuals often miss out on important updates. This work aims to reduce the burden on users of identifying relevant feed items by exploiting observed user interactions with content and people on the network and facilitates the personalization of network feeds in a manner which promotes relevant activities. We present the results of a large scale live evaluation which shows that personalized feeds are more successful at attracting user attention than non-personalized feeds.},

Overall, women learned less than men, but they learned different amounts in the choice and no choice conditions, whereas men seemed unaffected by choice.

More specifically, we investigate a number of adaptations of the query clarity predictor in order to infer the ambiguity in user and item profiles. The properties of each predictor are empirically studied by, first, checking the correlation of the predictor output with a performance measure, and second, by incorporating a performance predictor into a recommender system to produce a dynamic strategy. Depending on how the predictor is integrated with the system, we explore two different applications: dynamic user neighbour weighting and hybrid recommendation. The performance of such dynamic strategies is examined and compared with that of static ones.},

abstract = {Situation awareness is a perception of the available information, events, resources, and environment within a given time and space. Humans have limited abilities to obtain and maintain situation awareness, as they need to carefully orchestrate the available resources. A failure to maintain situation awareness may lead to serious errors in human behavior. Investigation of the situation awareness of neurosurgeons using cognitive architectures is a new and exciting application of computational user modeling. Accurately modeling of the surgeons' behavior and their mental states while they perform operations using miniature instruments and movements require various implicit measures of the surgeons' behavior. The user modeling community has been searching for such data sources in other domains and have indicated that eye-tracking, as a non-invasive methodology, can be used to enrich the user models and increase their quality. In this research I will 1) investigate what are the constituents of situation awareness during neurosurgery, 2) how eye-tracking methodologies fit to created suitable user models of situation awareness, and 3) how data should be processed, and what features of eye-tracking data work best. We propose to use eye tracking techniques to develop a comprehensive computational model of the surgeons' behavior. The model will be further interpreted, to understand how information, events, and surgeons' actions will impact neurosurgery operations.},

Many RSs use the Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique, where the system gathers some information about the users by eliciting their ratings for items. To do so, the system may actively choose the items to present to the users to rate. This proactive approach is called Active Learning (AL), since the system actively search for relevant data before building any predictive model of the user interests. But, since not all the ratings will improve the accuracy in the same way, finding the best items to query the users for their ratings is challenging.

abstract = {This paper describes our research lines that focus on modeling and inferring student procedural knowledge in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Our proposal is to apply Item Response Theory, a well-founded theory for declarative knowledge assessment, to infer procedural knowledge in problem solving environments. Therefore, we treat the problems as tests and the steps of problem solving as options (or choices) in a question. An important feature of our system is that it is not only based on an expert analysis, but also on data-driven techniques so that it can collect the largest amount of students' problem solving strategies as possible.},

abstract = {Personal information management (PIM) is a study on how people handle personal information to support their needs and tasks. In the last decade a lot of studies focused on how people acquire, organize, maintain and retrieve information from their information spaces. Results have led to many research prototypes that tried to either augment present tools or integrate these collections within entirely new designs. However, not much has changed in the present tools, and hierarchies still prevail as the storage foundation. Our research aims at understanding the difference between how people organize their information in various applications and physical space and how they actually think of this information in relation to tasks they have to accomplish. We carried out a preliminary study and are currently finishing another study which both show that there is a difference on how information is organized in formal structures on computers and physical spaces and how it is thought of in users' heads. These findings have motivated the design of an application that tries to mimic the latter and adapts to current computer activities.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to contextual search, based on the automatically extracted metadata from visited documents. User model represents user's interests as a combination of tags, keywords and named entities. Such user model is further enhanced by automatically detected communities of similar users, based on the similarities of their models. The user may belong to multiple communities, each representing one of her possibly many personas - roles or stereotypes, facets of her interests. We discuss further possibilities of using this model to bring more fine-grained contextualization and search improvement by using short contexts.},

abstract = {This work exploits folksonomy for building User Interest Profile (UIP) based on user's search history. UIP is an indispensable source of knowledge which can be exploited by intelligent systems for query recommendation, personalized search, and web search result ranking etc. A UIP consist of a clustered list of concepts and their weights. We show how to design, implement, and visualize such a system, in practice, which aids in finding interesting relationships between concepts and detect outliers, if any. The experiment reveals that UIP not only captures user interests but also its context and results are very promising.},

isbn = {9783642223617},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {Adaptation on public displays brings certain advantages and risks. Due to the implicit nature of adaptation, the users often miss the causality behind the adaptive behavior. Moreover, a high degree of autonomy in adaptive displays may leave the users with the feeling of control loss. Limited amount of transparency and controllability leads to the loss of user trust. As a result, the users feel insecure, frustrated, and are likely to abandon the system. The research goal of this work is to optimize the system actions in a ubiquitous display environment, in order make adaptation design transparent, controllable, and thus trustworthy. By means of a decision-theoretic approach the user trust can be assessed in different trust-critical contexts. The contexts describe the changes in the environment that call for adaptation: privacy of content, social setting, and accuracy of knowledge. The generated decisions enable the system to maintain trust and keep interaction comfortable.},

Therefore, a user modeling approach will be developed which enables personalized services to shape the content towards individual information needs of novice, advanced and experienced knowledge workers. The novelty of this approach is a modeling strategy which combines user modeling characteristics from distinct research areas, the emergent properties of the socio-computational environment as well as non-invasive knowledge diagnosis methods based on the user's past interaction with the system.},

To improve this situation, we have developed and evaluated an Instant Messaging (IM) service and client based on a pictographic communication system, and with a user interface designed taking into account their accessibility requirements. But the evaluation with individuals with learning disabilities has pointed out the need to take into account the great communications and computer skills diversity, even in groups with similar disability levels. Therefore, in this paper we present our plans to model the communication and accessibility requirements of individuals with learning disabilities in order to develop a mechanism to automatically personalize the IM client user interface and adapt it to their needs.},
