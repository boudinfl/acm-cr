abstract = {ACM UMAP 2017 is the 25th conference on User Modeling, on Adaptive Hypermedia, or on both together (since 2009). The research has actually been going on for more than 25 years as initially there was a conference only every two years. This keynote offers both reflection on the past and outlook into the future, with the burning question: What makes us UMAP? We perform research on modeling users (individuals as well as groups), not just for fun but to use these models for recommendations and for adaptation. That's not unique to us. In recommender systems analyzing user behavior is needed in order to give better and better recommendations, and likewise an area like educational data mining analyzes how learners study in order to best guide them to new learning material or followup courses. With analysis of social networks and website adaptation we step into the same research area that is covered by the hypertext community. If all of this is "us" but "not just us", where is our identity?One key characteristic of User Modeling is our quest to come up with understandable user models, or scrutable as Judy Kay coins them. The same is true for the adaptation: we strive to understand why certain adaptation happens or why a certain recommendation is given. UMAP research is not complete if we cannot understand the chain that leads from user action to (a perhaps much later) system reaction.As we move from expert-driven adaptation towards data-driven adaptation the problem of understanding the user-modeling-to-adaptation process is becoming harder and harder. But we need this understanding to ensure that adaptation continues to adapt in the right way under continuously changing circumstances (both in what we adapt and in the users and context we adapt to). We need the understanding also to prevent continuous adaptation from creating filter bubbles and to avoid creating the illusion that the recommendations will always be "right" because of the "wisdom of the crowd" principle.One key element has always been missing from UMAP, and this keynote will fill that void: we need to practice what we preach. Therefore, the conference proceedings will only contain this abstract, but there will be a real paper to go with this abstract. That paper cannot be printed because it is adaptive.The URL of the keynote paper is http://gale.win.tue.nl/keynote/.},

abstract = {What is human emotion? It turns out there are more than 90 definitions. Among the most recent well-accepted ones, emotion is understood as our reaction to external and internal events such as a loud noise (external, surprise), being told we passed the college entrance exam (external, joy), or a thought that triggered the memory of a bygone love (internal, sad). We care about emotions because they motivate us to take actions, influence the quality of our decisions, and enhance our ability to empathize and communicate.In this talk, I will describe the various challenges related to understanding, detecting, and visualizing emotions in large text datasets. To show you the research methodology we have explored and developed, I will demonstrate concrete steps and systems for eliciting emotion annotations from crowd workers, motivating and incentivizing them, building domain-specific lexicons, processing modifiers such as negations and intensifiers, and detecting emotions in human dialogs such as those found in TV series and movies. The talk will end with some suggestions for future work in this area including building emotion-aware dialog systems.},

abstract = {As crowdsourcing gains popularity, organisations seek ways to systematically and reliably involve their workforce with data processing pipelines. Mobile crowdsourcing allows for opportunistic task executions and thus, potentially, for higher throughput. However, how to engage and to retain employees in enterprise crowdsourcing campaigns is still an open research topic. This paper discusses the results of a study performed in IBM Benelux. We surveyed 93 employees to discover the factors that might affect engagement in mobile enterprise crowdsourcing. The survey informed the design of an experiment that aimed at investigating the effectiveness of different task notification strategies. We studied how factors such as time and context of notification can affect the participation and retention of employees. Results show that break times are the most suitable for crowd work, and that ``aggressive'' notification strategies act as deterrent for participation, while moderate yet regular nudges are the most likely to retain contributors.},

This new approach to recommendations reveals an aspect that was previously overlooked: the difference between short-term and long-term recommendations. In this work we characterize the full short-term/long-term profile of many collaborative filtering methods, and we show how recurrent neural networks can be steered towards better short or long-term predictions. We also show that RNNs are not only adapted to session-based collaborative filtering, but are perfectly suited for collaborative filtering on dense datasets where it outperforms traditional item recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Videos can be a powerful medium for acquiring soft skills, where learning requires contextualisation in personal experience and ability to see different perspectives. However, to learn effectively while watching videos, students need to actively engage with video content. We implemented interactive notetaking during video watching in an active video watching system (AVW) as a means to encourage engagement. This paper proposes a systematic approach to utilise learning analytics for the introduction of adaptive intervention - a choice architecture for personalised nudges in the AVW to extend learning. A user study was conducted and used as an illustration. By characterising clusters derived from user profiles, we identify different styles of engagement, such as parochial learning, habitual video watching, and self-regulated learning (which is the target ideal behaviour). To find opportunities for interventions, interaction traces in the AVW were used to identify video intervals with high user interest and relevant behaviour patterns that indicate when nudges may be triggered. A prediction model was developed to identify comments that are likely to have high social value, and can be used as examples in nudges. A framework for interactive personalised nudges was then conceptualised for the case study.},

abstract = {How can we effectively recommend items to a user about whom we have no information? This is the problem we focus on in this paper, known as the cold-start problem. In most existing works, the cold-start problem is handled through the use of many kinds of information available about the user. However, what happens if we do not have any information? Recommender systems usually keep a substantial amount of prediction models that are available for analysis. Moreover, recommendations to new users yield uncertain returns. Assuming that a number of alternative prediction models is available to select items to recommend to a cold user, this paper introduces a multi-armed bandit based model selection, named PdMS. In comparison with three baselines, PdMS improves the performance as measured by the nDCG. These improvements are demonstrated on real, public datasets.},

abstract = {Open Learner Models (OLM) show the learner model to users to assist their self-regulated learning by, for example, helping prompt reflection, facilitating planning and supporting navigation. OLMs can show different levels of detail of the underlying learner model, and can also structure the information differently. As a result, a trade-off may exist between the potential for better support for learning and the complexity of the information shown. This paper investigates students' perceptions about whether offering more and richer information in an OLM will result in more effective support for their self-regulated learning. In a first study, questionnaire responses relating to designs for six visualisations of varying complexity led to the implementation of three variations on one of the designs. A second controlled study involved students interacting with these variations. The study revealed that the most useful variation for searching for suitable learning material was a visualisation combining a basic coloured grid, an extended bar chart-like visualisation indicating related concepts, and a learning gauge.},

We experiment with behavioral user models based on interactions with smart devices in a museum, and investigate the personalized recommendation of what to see after visiting an initial set of Point of Interests (POIs), a key problem in personalizing museum visits or tour guides. We have logged users' onsite physical information interactions of visits in a museum. Moreover, to have a better understanding of users' information interaction behaviors and their preferences, we have collected and studied query logs of a search engine of the same collection, and we have found similarities between users' online digital and onsite physical information interaction behaviors. We exploit user modeling based on users' different information interaction behaviors and experiment with a novel approach to a critical one-shot POI recommendation using deep neural multilayer perceptron based on explicitly given users' contextual information, and set-based extracted features using users' physical information interaction behaviors and similar users' digital information interaction behaviors. Experimental results indicates that our proposed behavioral user modeling, using both physical and digital user information interaction behaviors, improves the onsite POI recommendation baselines' performances in all common Information Retrieval evaluation metrics. Our proposed approach provides an effective way to achieve a high precision at rank 1 in onsite critical one-shot POI recommendation problem.},

Some clustering algorithms like K-means require the adjustment of many parameters, and force the clustering without considering the clusterability of the dataset. Others, like DBSCAN, are adjusted to a fixed density threshold, so can't detect clusters with different densities. In this paper we propose a new clustering algorithm based on the mutual vote, which adjusts itself automatically to the dataset, demands a minimum of parameterizing, and is able to detect clusters with different densities in the same dataset. We test our algorithm and compare it to other clustering algorithms for clustering users, and predict their purchases in the context of recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Route planner systems support commuters and city visitors in finding the best route between two arbitrary points. More advanced route planners integrate different transportation modes such as private transport, public transport, car- and bicycle sharing or walking and are able combine these to multi-modal routes. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art planner systems usually do not consider the users' personal preferences or the wisdom of the crowd when suggesting multi-modal routes. Including the knowledge and experience of locals who are familiar with local transport allows identification of alternative routes which are, for example, less crowded during peak hours. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a technique that allows recommending items such as multi-modal routes based on the ratings of users with similar preferences. In this paper, we introduce RouteMe, a mobile recommender system for personalized, multi-modal routes which combines CF with knowledge-based recommendations to increase the quality of route recommendations. We present our hybrid algorithm in detail and show how we integrate it in a working prototype. The results of a user study show that our prototype combining CF, knowledge-based and popular route recommendations outperforms state-of-the-art route planners.},

abstract = {Stereotypes are frequently used in real life to classify students according to their performance in class. In literature, we can find many references to weaker students, fast learners, struggling students, etc. Given the lack of detailed data about students, these or other kinds of stereotypes could be potentially used for user modeling and personalization in the educational context. Recent research in MOOC context demonstrated that data-driven learner stereotypes could work well for detecting and preventing student dropouts. In this paper, we are exploring the application of stereotype-based modeling to a more challenging task -- predicting student problem-solving and learning in two programming courses and two MOOCs. We explore traditional stereotypes based on readily available factors like gender or education level as well as some advanced data-driven approaches to group students based on their problem-solving behavior. Each of the approaches to form student stereotype cohorts is validated by comparing models of student learning: do students in different groups learn differently? In the search for the stereotypes that could be used for adaptation, the paper examines ten approaches. We compare the performance of these approaches and draw conclusions for future research.},

We introduce a novel integration-level approach to model learners' knowledge and provide fine-grained diagnosis: a Bayesian network based on a new kind of knowledge graph with progressive integration skills. We assess the value of such a model from multifaceted aspects: performance prediction, parameter plausibility, expected instructional effectiveness, and real-world recommendation helpfulness.

We tested our implementation on 135 students in a noisy computer-enabled high school classroom and were able to collect a median 95% valid eye gaze data in 85% of the sessions where gaze data was successfully recorded. Machine learning methods were employed to develop automated detectors of mind wandering (MW) -- a phenomenon involving a shift in attention from task-related to task-unrelated thoughts that is negatively correlated with performance. Our student-independent, gaze-based models could detect MW with an accuracy (F1 of MW = 0.59) significantly greater than chance (F1 of MW = 0.24). Predicted rates of mind wandering were negatively related to posttest performance, providing evidence for the predictive validity of the detector. We discuss next steps towards developing gaze-based, attention-aware, learning technologies that can be deployed in noisy, real-world environments.},

abstract = {In many areas of data mining, data is collected from human beings. In this contribution, we ask the question of how people actually respond to ordinal scales. The main problem observed is that users tend to be volatile in their choices, i.e. complex cognitions do not always lead to the same decisions, but to distributions of possible decision outputs. This human uncertainty may sometimes have quite an impact on common data mining approaches and thus, the question of effective modelling this so called human uncertainty emerges naturally.Our contribution introduces two different approaches for modelling the human uncertainty of user responses. In doing so, we develop techniques in order to measure this uncertainty at the level of user inputs as well as the level of user cognition. With support of comprehensive user experiments and large-scale simulations, we systematically compare both methodologies along with their implications for personalisation approaches. Our findings demonstrate that significant amounts of users do submit something completely different (action) than they really have in mind (cognition). Moreover, we demonstrate that statistically sound evidence with respect to algorithm assessment becomes quite hard to realise, especially when explicit rankings shall be built.},

In the research literature, various algorithmic approaches to determine suitable next tracks can be found. However, almost all of them were evaluated in offline experiments using, for example, manually created playlists as a gold standard. In this work, we aim to check the external validity of insights that are obtained through such offline experiments on historical datasets. We conducted an online user study involving 277 subjects in which the participants evaluated the suitability of four different alternatives of continuing a given set of playlists. Our results indicate that manually created playlists can in fact represent a reasonable gold standard, an insight for which no evidence existed in the literature before. Furthermore, our work was able to confirm that considering playlist homogeneity aspects does not only lead to performance improvements in offline experiments -- as indicated by past research -- but also to a better quality perception by users. However, the observations also revealed that user studies of this type can be easily distorted by item familiarity biases, because the participants tend to evaluate continuation alternatives better when they know the track or the artist.},

abstract = {Social media platforms have become popular in many enterprises. Employees build their social eminence by effectively engaging on these platforms. Becoming socially eminent in the organization is a personal journey and many employees need guidance to succeed. In this paper, we describe a tool called Personal Social Dashboard deployed within our enterprise. The tool provides feedback to employees on how effectively they engage in the enterprise social network by maintaining a set of scores covering different aspects of one's social role, such as Activity, Network, Reaction, and Eminence. We provide a description of the tool with a subsequent study of its use within the company and effect on employees' behavior in the company's social network.},

abstract = {Proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile devices has brought a plurality of location-aware applications leveraging the location characteristics in the shared content, like photos and check-ins. While these applications provide contextual and relevant information, they also assume geo-tagged contents to be representative of the geo-bounded characteristics of location. In this paper, however, we show that the characteristics geo-tagged contents capture about a location can vary based on the familiarity of user (sharing the content) with the location. Using a large dataset of geo-tagged photos, we learn descriptive spatial photo characteristics and user temporal-location-familiarity to highlight unique characteristics photos capture of location, which vary significantly if taken by locals versus tourists. We then propose a ranking-approach to find most representative photos for a given city. A user-based evaluation shows photos are more diverse and characteristic of location compared to other popular baselines while being representative of how locals and tourists would describe the city.},

This paper investigates how humans adapt next exercise selection to learner personality and invested mental effort to enable a future Intelligent Tutoring System to use these adaptations. Participants were presented with validated stories of a learner`s personality at polarised levels, a validated story conveying the mental effort invested in carrying out a given task and an indication of a previous performance (just passing) at a simple arithmetic exercise. Participants were also shown a selection of validated exercises of varying difficulty levels and asked to select the exercise which they thought the learner should do next. We found that overall more difficult exercises were selected for learners who used little effort than for learners who used more effort. We found that although an exercise of slightly harder difficulty remains the most popular choice in the high and low self-esteem conditions, for low self-esteem, participants picked an exercise of lower or the same difficulty more often than in the high condition.},

Past approaches to this issue of untagged problems have centered around text mining to impute knowledge components (KC). In this work, we advance KC imputation research by modeling both the content (text) of a problem as well as the context (problems around it) using a novel application of skip-gram based representation learning applied to tens of thousands of student response sequences from the ASSISTments 2012 public dataset. We find that there is as much information in the contextual representation as the content representation, with the combination of sources of information leading to a 90% accuracy in predicting the missing skill from a KC model of 198. This work underscores the value of considering problems in context for the KC prediction task and has broad implications for its use with other modeling objectives such as KC model improvement.},

However, state-of-the-art elicitation methods of cognitive styles require researchers to apply explicit, in-lab, and time-consuming "paper-and-pencil" techniques, rendering real-time integration of cognitive styles? elicitation impractical in interactive system design. Aiming to elaborate an implicit elicitation method of cognitive styles, this paper reports two feasibility studies based on an eye-tracking multifactorial model. In both studies, participants performed visual activities of varying characteristics, and the eye-tracking analysis revealed quantitative differences on visual behavior among individuals with different cognitive styles. Based on these differences, a series of classification experiments were conducted, and the results revealed that gaze-based implicit elicitation of cognitive styles in real-time is feasible, which could be used by interactive systems to adapt to the users' cognitive needs and preferences, to better assist them, and improve their performance and experience.},

Existing approaches try to compensate for the lack of group profiles, by either merging individual profiles, or treating users separately and then fusing the recommendations. Both paradigms thus fail to account for the different roles and behaviors people assume when making group decisions. In this work, we propose two novel group recommendation models that explicitly try to model the behavior of group members and distinguish it from that when they act alone. A detailed evaluation has shown that our models consistently provide significantly better recommendations.

Because game-based learning environments elicit a wide range of student affective states, affect-enhanced student modeling for game-based learning holds considerable promise. This paper introduces an affect-enhanced student modeling framework that leverages facial expression tracking for game-based learning. The affect-enhanced student modeling framework was used to generate predictive models of student learning and student engagement for students who interacted with CRYSTAL ISLAND, a game-based learning environment for microbiology education. Findings from the study reveal that the affect-enhanced student models significantly outperform baseline predictive student models that utilize the same gameplay traces but do not use facial expression tracking. The study also found that models based on individual facial action coding units are more effective than composite emotion models. The findings suggest that introducing facial expression tracking can improve the accuracy of student models, both for predicting student learning gains and also for predicting student engagement.},

Next, given such a representation, a logistic regression layer calculates the relevance score of each item for a specific user and we returns the top-N items as recommendations.In the experimental session we evaluated the effectiveness of our approach against several baselines: first, we compared it to other shallow models based on neural networks (as Word2Vec and Doc2Vec), next we evaluated it against state-of-the-art algorithms for collaborative filtering. In both cases, our methodology obtains a significant improvement over all the baselines, thus giving evidence of the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in content-based recommendation scenarios and paving the way for several future research directions.},

abstract = {Digital devices (most often laptops and smartphones), though desired tools by students in a higher education classroom, have in the past been shown to serve more as distractors than supporters of learning. One of the reasons is the often undirected nature of the devices' usage. With our work we aim to turn students' digital devices into teaching and communication tools by seamlessly interleaving lecture material and complex questions in the students' browser through ASQ, a Web application for broadcasting and tracking interactive presentations. ASQ's fine-grained logging abilities allow us to track second by second to what extent students are engaging with ASQ which in turn enables insights into student behaviour dynamics. This setup enables us to conduct "in situ" experiments. Based on the logs collected in a longitudinal study over a ten week period across 14 lectures with more than 300 students, we investigate (i) to what extent ASQ can be reliably employed to assess attention and learning in the classroom, and (ii) whether different in-class question spacing strategies impact student learning and engagement.},

We present a novel method for inferring contextual user preferences by using an unsupervised deep learning technique applied to mobile sensor data. We train an auto-encoder for each user preference with contextual data that based on past user interaction with the system. Given new contextual sensor data from a user, the patterns discovered from each auto-encoder are used to predict the most likely preference in the given context. This can greatly enhance a variety of services, such as mobile online advertising and context-aware recommender systems. We demonstrate our contribution with a point of interest (POI) recommender system in which we label contextual preferences based on the interaction of users with categories of items. Empirical results utilizing a real world dataset of mobile users show a significant improvement (16% to 73% improvement) in classification accuracy compared with state of the art classification methods.},

abstract = {In the information overloaded web, personalized recommender systems are essential tools to help users find most relevant information. The most heavily-used recommendation frameworks assume user interactions that are characterized by a single relation. However, for many tasks, such as recommendation in social networks, user-item interactions must be modeled as a complex network of multiple relations, not only a single relation. Recently research on multi-relational factorization and hybrid recommender models has shown that using extended meta-paths to capture additional information about both users and items in the network can enhance the accuracy of recommendations in such networks. Most of this work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous networks, and to apply these techniques, weighted relations must be simplified into binary ones. However, information associated with weighted edges, such as user ratings, which may be crucial for recommendation, are lost in such binarization. In this paper, we explore a random walk sampling method in which the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and apply this generate extended meta-paths in weighted heterogeneous networks. With this sampling technique, we demonstrate improved performance on multiple data sets both in terms of recommendation accuracy and model generation efficiency.},

abstract = {Sense of community is regarded as the reflection of students' feelings of connectedness with community members and commonality of learning expectations and goals. In online courses, sense of community has been proven to influence students' learning engagement and academic performance. Low sense of community is also one of the reasons for drop out. However, existing studies mainly acquire students' sense of community via questionnaires, which demand user efforts and have difficulty in obtaining real-time feeling during students' learning process. In addition, although communication is helpful to enhance students' sense of community, little work has empirically compared the impact of different online communication tools. In this paper, we are motivated to derive students' sense of community from their communication behavior in online courses. Concretely, we first identify a set of features that are significantly correlated with students' sense of community, which not only include their activities carried out in both synchronous and asynchronous online learning environment, but also their linguistic content in conversational texts. We then develop inference model to unify these features for determining students' sense of community, and find that LASSO performs the best in terms of inference accuracy.},

People have different preferences and responses when it comes to both exercising an playing games, meaning that there are potential benefits from creating a user model for exergaming. This could support various forms of personalization, such as game recommenders, and personalization within a game. We define a VR exergame user model, VRex, that represents a user's exertion as well a their goals and preferences for exercise and for games We illustrate the use of VRex to represent 1 users who played 4 games, based on data about their actual and perceived exertion and their satisfaction with each game. This demonstrates the diversity of the user models, in terms of the user model's components. This is the first work to explore the design of user models for virtual reality exergames and has the potential to serve as a foundation for game personalization, recommenders and open model interfaces.},

Despite this evidence and the abundance of weather data, weather has mostly been overlooked in the machine learning and data science research. This work shows how causal analysis can be applied to discover the effects of weather on TV watching patterns and how it can be applied for user modeling. We make several contributions. First, we show that some weather attributes, e.g., pressure and precipitation, cause significant changes in TV watching patterns. Second, we compare the results obtained for different levels of user granularity and different types of users. This showcases that causal analysis can be a valuable tool in user modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale causal study of the impact of weather on TV watching patterns.},

abstract = {Regression under the "small n$, large p" condition, of small sample size n and large number of features p in the learning data set, is a recurring setting in which learning from data is difficult. With prior knowledge about relationships of the features, p can effectively be reduced, but explicating such prior knowledge is difficult for experts. In this paper we introduce a new method for eliciting expert prior knowledge about the similarity of the roles of features in the prediction task. The key idea is to use an interactive multidimensional-scaling (MDS) type scatterplot display of the features to elicit the similarity relationships, and then use the elicited relationships in the prior distribution of prediction parameters. Specifically, for learning to predict a target variable with Bayesian linear regression, the feature relationships are used to construct a Gaussian prior with a full covariance matrix for the regression coefficients. Evaluation of our method in experiments with simulated and real users on text data confirm that prior elicitation of feature similarities improves prediction accuracy. Furthermore, elicitation with an interactive scatterplot display outperforms straightforward elicitation where the users choose feature pairs from a feature list.},

abstract = {In modern recommender systems, diversity has been widely acknowledged as an important factor to improve user experience and, more recently, intent-aware approaches to diversification have been proposed to provide the user with a list of recommendations covering different aspects of her behavior. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performances of two diversification methods taking into account temporal aspects of the user profile: in the first one we adopt a temporal decay function to emphasize the importance of more recent items in the user profile while in the second one we perform an evaluation based on the identification and analysis of temporal sessions. The two proposed methods have been implemented as temporal variants of the well-known xQuAD framework. In both cases, experimental results on Netflix 100M show an improvement in terms of accuracy-diversity balance.},

Collaborative filtering has been proven to outperform content-based filtering in a variety of scenarios. However, in item cold-start, collaborative filtering cannot be used directly since past user interactions are not available for the newly added items. Hence, content-based filtering is usually the only viable option left.},

abstract = {Much of the focus of recommender systems research has been on the accurate prediction of users' ratings for unseen items. Recent work has suggested that objectives such as diversity and novelty in recommendations are also important factors in the effectiveness of a recommender system. However, methods that attempt to increase diversity of recommendation lists for all users without considering each user's preference or tolerance for diversity may lead to monotony for some users and to poor recommendations for others. Our goal in this research is to evaluate the hypothesis that users' propensity towards diversity varies greatly and that the diversity of recommendation lists should be consistent with the level of user interest in diverse recommendations. We propose a pre-filtering clustering approach to group users with similar levels of tolerance for diversity. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a method for personalizing diversity by performing collaborative filtering independently on different segments of users based on the degree of diversity in their profiles. Secondly, we investigate the accuracy-diversity tradeoffs using the proposed method across different user segments. As part of this evaluation we propose new metrics, adapted from information retrieval, that help us measure the effectiveness of our approach in personalizing diversity. Our experimental evaluation is based on two different datasets: MovieLens movie ratings, and Yelp restaurant reviews.},

In order to provide a personality-based experience to the user, users' behavior, preferences, and needs in relation to their personality need to be investigated. Although for a technological mediated environment the search for these relationships is often new territory, there are findings from personality research of the real world that can be used in personalized systems. However, for these findings to be implementable, we need to investigate whether they hold in a technologically mediated environment. In this study we assess prior work on personality-based music genre preferences from traditional personality research. We analyzed a dataset consisting of music listening histories and personality scores of 1415 Last.fm users. Our results show agreements with prior work, but also important differences that can help to inform personalized systems.},

abstract = {Many Recommender Systems (RSs) rely on user preference data in the form of ratings or likes for items. Previous research has shown that item comparisons can also be effectively used to model user preferences and build RS. However, users often express their preferences by referring to specific features of the items. For instance, a user may like Italian movies more than Indian ones or like action-thriller movies. In this paper, we map such preferences over features to comparisons between items. For instance, when a user's favorite feature is `action', we then assume that `action' movies are preferred to some of the movies that are not `action'. In this work we effectively incorporate these feature based comparisons in a RS and show that such preferences can be effectively combined along with other item comparisons. Moreover, we also study the usefulness of the available features.},

These definitions while having numerous design factors in different domains help identify and recommend relevant content. For example, similarity between users, or items, are measured based on, but not limited to, explicit feedback such as ratings, thumbs up; or/and implicit feedback such as clicks, views etc; or/and based on composition of item such as tags, metadata etc. In this paper, we explore a similarity model while very intuitive to find similar items using a very common natural law of attraction between bodies, that is gravitational law. We show how the two attributes, relative mass and distance between the bodies, of gravitation law can be interpreted for an effective personalized recommendations; in both spatial and non-spatial domains. Finally, we illustrate the use of distance and mass in a non-spatial domain and we exhibit the accuracy in recommendations against popular baselines.},

To investigate this particular user characteristic, this paper presents an analysis of multilingual search user behaviors through a series of large-scale studies using crowdsourcing. Results show that multilingual users make significant use of each of their languages when searching, and that there are significant differences in behaviors between querying and result selection. In addition, results show that language use strongly depends on a number of task factors and individual user characteristics. These results are discussed in terms of building novel adaptive multilingual search solutions that better support and adapt to users who have multiple language abilities.},

The experiment result shows the user did fuse the different recommended sources and exploration patterns among tasks.

abstract = {With the increasing number of scientific publications, research paper recommendation has become increasingly important for scientists. Most researchers rely on keyword-based search or following citations in other papers, in order to find relevant research articles. And usually they spend a lot of time without getting satisfactory results. This study aims to propose a personalized research paper recommendation system, that facilitate this task by recommending papers based on users' explicit and implicit feedback. The users will be allowed to explicitly specify the papers of interest. In addition, user activities (e.g., viewing abstracts or full-texts) will be analyzed in order to enhance users' profiles. Most of the current research paper recommendation and information retrieval systems use the classical bag-of-words methods, which don't consider the context of the words and the semantic similarity between the articles. This study will use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to discover continuous and latent semantic features of the papers, in order to improve the recommendation quality. The proposed approach utilizes PubMed so far, since it is frequently used by physicians and scientists, but it can easily incorporate other datasets in the future.},

Besides, it has been shown that the recommendation needs of groups go beyond the aggregation of individual preferences. In practice, it is much more difficult to predict group choices because users take into account the others' reactions and different users react to the group in different ways. Thus, in this research, we aim at exploiting an interactive and conversational approach to facilitate the group decision-making process where the complex trade-off between the satisfaction of an individual and the group as a whole typically occurs and needs to be resolved. To attain this goal, we investigate approaches that can access a group situation and autonomously learn an adaptive interaction in a specific condition of the group.},

abstract = {Active participation of users in Q&amp;A social networks like Stack Overflow is key to the sustenance of the network. One way to encourage participation is to allow collaboration or cooperation between users in order to improve question and answer posts, and allow users to learn from one another. In order to implement strategies that encourage cooperation, it is important to understand what influences the users in the network to cooperate. In this extended abstract, we investigate the social support principles that influence cooperation in Stack Overflow. Using a sample size of 282 Stack Overflow users, we develop and test a global research model using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). We further investigate any possible differences in the effect of these strategies between cultures, by testing two cultural subgroups; collectivist and individualist cultures. Our results show that social learning significantly influences cooperation in Stack Overflow at the global level. However, at the cultural subgroup level, recognition influences cooperation among collectivists, while social facilitation influences individualists to cooperate. These findings suggest possible design guidelines in the development of successful personalized Q&amp;A social networking sites that encourage participation through cooperation.},

To illustrate the potential of this hybrid approach, we have used a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to organize a large number of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from subjects watching videos, according to their internal structure. Results suggest that a more useful labelling scheme could be produced by analysing the resulting topology in relation to user reported valence levels (i.e., pleasantness) for each signal, refining the original set of target classes.},

This is a key factor also in the group recommendation domain, where the context is characterized by the presence of other people with whom the activities must be performed. In this case, social influences and relationships between users come into play, and the individual satisfaction that each user will obtain could change in relation to those social characteristics. In this work, we start an experimental analysis on how ties' strength and possible conflicts in a relationship can influence the opinion shift, with the aim to derive a model that can be used to adapt individual utilities to the "Group Context" before aggregating them into the group's ones.},

Main contribution is a combination of global patterns with patterns specific for groups of similar users.

To minimize risk and prevent misuse of this data by unauthorized users, access must be restricted to verified users. Current classification-based methods for gesture-based user verification only consider single gestures, and not sequences. In this paper, we present a method which utilizes information from sequences of touchscreen gestures, and the context in which the gestures were made. To evaluate our approach, we built an application which records all the necessary data from the device (touch and contextual sensors which do not consume significant battery life), and installed it on several Galaxy S4 smartphones. The smartphones were given to 20 volunteers to use as their personal phones for two-weeks. Using XGBoost on the collected data, we were able to classify between a legitimate user and the population of illegitimate users (imposters) with an average equal error rate (EER) of 4.78% and an average area under the curve (AUC) of 98.15%. Our method demonstrates that by considering sequences of gestures, as opposed to individual gestures, the accuracy of the verification process improves significantly.},

abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) consists of a large number of interconnected, low cost devices and the framework for managing them. While this provides the means for rich and ubiquitous personalized interaction, a key gap is the lack of support for user modeling to harness and manage personal data gathered from IoT. Our work fills this gap by creating the IoTum user modeling framework for Internet-of-Things applications. Our design goals were to make it easy for IoT application developers to use, tackling the difficulty of building ubicomp systems. At the same time, we aimed to achieve light-weight, flexible, powerful, reactive user modeling that is accountable, transparent and scrutable.Applications interact with IoTum via three primitives, 'tell' to add evidence to a user model, 'ask' to retrieve interpreted evidenced from the model and 'listen' which establishes a monitoring process which can trigger the application. The first two of these have been part of many previous user modelling frameworks, including Personis, the server by Kobsa and Fink, CUMULATE and info-bead. However, IoTum is the first user modelling framework we are aware of that supports the last of these, the 'listen', which is key to making effective use of the many existing and emerging low cost sensors of IoT. Another important aspect is that IoTum maintains provenance information in the user model, to support accountability, scrutability and explanations. There are also mechanisms to define the user model and do introspection on existing models. To demonstrate that it meets its design goals, we describe its use to build a nutrition chatbot.},

These findings suggest that it can be valuable to develop visualization systems that can provide personalized support targeting specific user characteristics. Furthermore, recent research [e.g., 3,5] has shown that eye tracking data can be leveraged to identify the elements of a visualization for which specific user differences hinder user experience or performance, thus providing concrete information on which specific personalized support could be helpful for different users (e.g., users with low perceptual speed may benefit from help in processing legends [1]). Though these findings are encouraging toward the design of user-adaptive or customized visualizations, they are generally related to either fictional tasks or research prototypes. So, it is unclear if existing results on the value of user-adaptive visualizations can transfer to real-world settings.},

Many studies aim at developing complex models to include contextual factors in the recommendation process. Despite a real improvement on the recommendations quality, such contextual factors face users' privacy and data collection issues. We support the idea that context could be expressed in term of item attributes rather than contextual factors. To investigate that hypothesis, we designed an online experiment where 174 users were asked to describe the context in which they would listen the proposed songs for which we collected 12 musical attributes. We make available all the material collected during this study for research purposes and non-commercial use.},

In this paper, we analyse the performance of a food recommender that allows users to enter their preferences in the form of both ratings and tags, which are then used by a Matrix Factorization (MF) rating prediction model. The performed offline and online experiments have clarified the importance of user tags in comparison to content features. While item content contributes more to the quality of the prediction accuracy, user tags yields better ranking quality. Even more importantly, a live user study has revealed that a system variant, which leverages user tags in the prediction model and in the interface, achieves a significantly better user evaluation in terms of perceived effectiveness, choice satisfaction and choice difficulty.},

The results of a simulation experiment illustrate that when users' preferences are not influenced by the group, the preference aggregation model should weigh more the long-term preferences. In contrast, when discussion-generated preferences tend either to align with each other or to diverge due to the group setting, it is beneficial to take into account more the discussion-generated preferences, which help to capture the newly arising interests of the users.},

However, the computation of these values is intrinsically difficult, as they may depend on other complex latent variables that also need to be estimated from observable quantities, e.g. the current student's ability. In this work, we have used system dynamics to model learning and predict the student's performance in a given exercise, in an existing ITS that was developed to teach students solve arithmetic-algebraic word problems. The high correlation between the predicted and real scores outlines the potential of this type of modeling as a prediction tool to support the decision about the next task that should be offered to the learner.},

abstract = {This poster briefly elucidates on a crowdsourced exploratory study demonstrating the impact of common features of news websites' design on perceived bias. Type of news website, user characteristics, and the overall design, were shown to impact on perceived bias. The poster also reports the results of a novel method to validate and extend the initial results through comparative reevaluation. These confirmed the initial results and revealed additional significant findings. Lastly, the paper proposes a model of bias for personalizing news websites.},

abstract = {Our data analysis on real-world datasets shows that user preferences are intimately related with item categories, implying the non-negligible of category information for effective recommendation. Thus, in this paper, step by step we propose a unified item-category latent factor model by considering user-category, item-category and category-category interactions. Our approach can be applied to both the situations where an item belongs to either a single category (one-to-one) or multiple categories (one-to-many). Finally, empirical studies on the real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in comparison with other counterparts.},

abstract = {This paper presents an exploratory study of the perceptions users have of diversity and ordering in playlist recommendations. There is a match between the diversification approach used in the system, and importance that users placed on the item properties. Surprisingly, participants had no expectations of the songs being in a particular order in a playlist. We discuss possible explanations for this finding, refining the research agenda to consider which ordering choices are perceptible to users, and influence user satisfaction.},

abstract = {Information shared on Twitter is ever increasing and users-recipients are overwhelmed by the number of tweets they receive, many of which of no interest. Filters that estimate the interest of each incoming post can alleviate this problem, for example by allowing users to sort incoming posts by predicted interest (e.g., "top stories" vs. "most recent" in Facebook). Global and personal filters have been used to detect interesting posts in social networks. Global filters are trained on large collections of posts and reactions to posts (e.g., retweets), aiming to predict how interesting a post is for a broad audience. In contrast, personal filters are trained on posts received by a particular user and the reactions of the particular user. Personal filters can provide recommendations tailored to a particular user's interests, which may not coincide with the interests of the majority of users that global filters are trained to predict. On the other hand, global filters are typically trained on much larger datasets compared to personal filters. Hence, global filters may work better in practice, especially with new users, for which personal filters may have very few training instances ("cold start" problem).Following Uysal and Croft, we devised a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both global and personal filters. As in global filters, we train a single system on a large, multi-user collection of tweets. Each tweet, however, is represented as a feature vector with a number of user-specific features.},

It considers inference consistency of different types of user data in the process of learning and aims to deliver accurate and effective inference results, even in cases where some types of data are missing for a user, e.g. the user has yet to post any tweets. Experiments conducted on a large-scale Twitter dataset show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches which use only a single type of user data for inference.},

abstract = {Time plays a crucial role in influencing and understanding users' changeable preferences among various factors which directly or indirectly result in users' interesting behavior. In this paper, we propose a neural time series forecasting model (NTSF) to fit and predict user preference trend according to time. In this model, we integrate emerging/hot topic detection to deal with the short-term aspects, and use Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to differentiate cyclic behavior of users. Considering the nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics appearing through user interest patterns, Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) is employed to balance the influence of short and long term aspects, as well as adjust model parameters according to historical results. Our experimental results with extensive Twitter datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

We evaluate the indirect context suggestion approaches over a movie data collected from user surveys, in comparison with direct context prediction approaches. Our experimental results reveal that indirect context suggestion is better and tensor factorization is generally the best way to suggest contexts to a user when given an item.},
