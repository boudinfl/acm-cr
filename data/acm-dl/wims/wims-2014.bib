abstract = {The Web has an enormous influence on our everyday life. Thus, more efficient intelligent approaches and technologies are needed to realize the Web's full potential. Intelligence can be achieved by making the Web aware of the semantics of its own structures and content and by applying intelligent techniques to effectively access web resources. The Semantic Web was one of the significant steps towards bringing Intelligence to the Web. Based on this starting point, the Web Intelligence, Mining, and Semantics (WIMS) community works toward researching and implementing the next generation of the intelligent Web for humans and machines. In this editorial, opening the volume of the proceedings of WIMS'14, we review the topics of interest for the WIMS community, analyze the response of this year's authors to these topics, and present the program of the conference. We hope that this material will be useful for a reader as a key for the structure and content of these proceedings.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss scalable methods for nonmonotonic rule-based reasoning over Semantic Web Data, using MapReduce. This work is motivated by the recent unparalleled explosion of available data coming from the Web, sensor readings, databases, ontologies and more. Such datasets could benefit from the introduction of rule sets encoding commonly accepted rules or facts, application or domain specific rules, commonsense knowledge etc. This raises the question of whether, how, and to what extent knowledge representation methods are capable of handling huge amounts of data for these applications. Our results indicate that our method shows good scalability properties and is able to handle a benchmark dataset of 1 billion triples, bringing it on par with state-of-the-art methods for monotonic reasoning on the semantic web.},

Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) is the field that investigates techniques to preserve the privacy of data and patterns. Knowledge Hiding, a subfield of PPDM, aims at preserving the sensitive patterns included in the data, which are going to be published. A wide variety of techniques fall under the umbrella of Knowledge Hiding, such as frequent pattern hiding, sequence hiding, classification rule hiding and so on.In this tutorial we create a taxonomy for the frequent itemset hiding techniques. We also provide as examples for each category representative works that appeared recently and fall into each one of these categories. Then, we focus on the detailed overview of a specific category, the so called linear programming-based techniques. Finally, we make a quantitative and qualitative comparison among some of the existing techniques that are classified into this category.},

abstract = {Concept Hierarchies and Formal Concept Analysis are theoretically well grounded and largely experimented methods. They rely on line diagrams called Galois lattices for visualizing and analysing object-attribute sets. Galois lattices are visually seducing and conceptually rich for experts. However they present important drawbacks due to their concept oriented overall structure: analysing what they show is difficult for non experts, navigation is cumbersome, interaction is poor, and scalability is a deep bottleneck for visual interpretation even for experts. In this paper we introduce semantic probes as a means to overcome many of these problems and extend usability and application possibilities of traditional FCA visualization methods. Semantic probes are visual user centred objects which extract and organize reduced Galois sub-hierarchies. They are simpler, clearer, and they provide a better navigation support through a rich set of interaction possibilities. Since probe driven sub-hierarchies are limited to users' focus, scalability is under control and interpretation is facilitated. After some successful experiments, several applications are being developed with the remaining problem of finding a compromise between simplicity and conceptual expressivity.},

In this paper, we describe a new approach for obtaining measures for Web page ranking. Unlike other recent approaches, it exploits the meta-terms extracted from the titles and urls for indexing the contents of web documents. We use the term impact to correlate each meta-term with document's content, rather than term frequency and other similar techniques. Our approach also uses the structural knowledge available in Wikipedia for making better expansion and formulation for the queries. Evaluation with automatic metrics provided by TREC reveals that our approach is effective for building the index and for retrieval. We present retrieval results from the ClueWeb collection, for a set of test queries, for two tasks: for an adhoc retrieval task and for a diversity task (which aims at retrieving relevant pages that cover different aspects of the queries).},

To achieve this goal, we introduce a simple and robust algorithm to generate extraction rules based on string matching using the blog's web feed in conjunction with blog hypertext. This approach leads to a scalable blog data extraction process. Furthermore, we show how we integrate a web browser into the web harvesting process in order to support data extraction from blogs with JavaScript generated content.},

abstract = {Browsing the web is one of the most common activities that users engage in nowadays, and downloading web resources of interest, such as images, documents, music, etc., is part of this process. However, users would rather temporarily save that resource to a default path that they have easy access to (e.g. their "Desktop") than select the actual directory where they would eventually place it. This clearly implies that existing user interfaces are not as effective for this particular task as the users would like them to be. Instead of proposing a different User Interface, in this paper, we try to address the problem at its core, and propose a methodology to suggest the most likely directory where the file would (eventually) be saved by the user. By doing so, future interfaces can also benefit from our technique. We provide a formal definition of the problem and propose a classification framework to tackle it. We present our overall solution to this problem, namely Directory Download PrediCtor, or DiDoCtor for short. We give experimental evidence of its effectiveness, by implementing our approach as part of a widely used browser and evaluate it with real user activity. We also discuss lessons learned from this process, regarding the efficiency perspective.},

abstract = {Named Entity Extraction is the process of identifying entities (like persons, locations, organizations, etc.) in texts and linking them to related semantic resources. This task is useful in several applications, e.g. for question answering, annotating documents, post-processing of search results, etc. However, existing named entity extraction tools lack an open or easy configuration, although this is very important for building domain-specific applications. For example, supporting a new category of entities, or updating an existing category with additional entities, is either impossible or very laborious. In this paper we show how we can exploit semantic information (Linked Data) at real-time for configuring (handily) a named entity extraction system. We also present X-Link, a fully configurable named entity extraction tool that realizes this approach. Contrary to the existing tools, X-Link allows the user to easily define the categories of entities that are interesting for the application at hand by exploiting one or more (on-line) semantic Knowledge Bases. The user is also able to update a category and specify how to semantically link and enrich the identified entities. This enhanced configurability allows X-Link to be configured for different contexts, for building domain-specific applications (e.g. for identifying drugs in a medical search system or for annotating and exploring fish species in a marine-related web page). To test the approach, we conducted a task-based evaluation with users that demonstrates the usability of the proposed approach, and a case study that demonstrates its feasibility.},

By using Active Learning techniques on crowd-labeled data, we optimize the performance of the automatic method towards better accuracy, while keeping the costs low by gathering data on demand. In order to verify our proposed methods, we apply them to the task of deduplication of publications in a digital library by examining metadata. We investigate the problems created by noisy labels produced by the crowd and explore methods to aggregate them. We analyze how different automatic methods are affected by the quantity and quality of the allocated resources as well as the instance selection strategies for each active learning round, aiming towards attaining a balance between cost and performance.},

This paper outlines the underlying methods, provides insights into the migration of proprietary knowledge sources to linked enterprise data, and discusses the lessons learned from adapting linked data for named entity linking. A large dataset obtained from Orell F\"{u}ssli, the largest Swiss business information provider, serves as the main showcase. This dataset includes more than nine million triples on companies, their contact information, management, products and brands. We identify major challenges towards applying this data for named entity linking and conduct a comprehensive evaluation based on several news corpora to illustrate how Recognyze helps address them, and how it improves the performance of named entity linking components drawing upon linked data rather than machine learning techniques.},

This paper describes a supervised approach recognizing Japanese dish name entity (DNE) from online reviews of Japanese cuisine website. In the first stage, this work adopts tweets as the data source to construct the dictionary of dish name elements through semantic rules and use Bayesian posterior to remove noise. Next stage, we maps first-stage dictionary as a non-local feature into Conditional Random Field (CRF) to recognize the dish name. This method can automatically add new dish name elements into the non-local dictionary by iteration during the recognition proceeding. By using 10-fold validation, experimental results show our method can reach 84.38% in F1 score and outperform the two baselines using the dictionary or CRF with term feature separately.},

abstract = {In this paper, we proposed edge-weight based method to perform a community detection in scale-free networks. Our main idea is that communities are formed from edges. We believe that in scale-free networks, each edge is not equal. Edges that connect to hub nodes are more important and should be weighted more than edges that connect to fewer nodes. Therefore, our proposed method begins with edge weight calculation based on centrality value of each edge. Then, two steps community detection algorithm performs iteratively until the community detection result is balanced. The first step of our algorithm is aimed to extract communities that node degree follows power law (scale-free). While the second step is aimed to extract communities that node degree follows normal degree distribution. The benefit is that our method can work on both scale-free and non scale-free networks. Moreover, in scale-free networks, not all communities contain hub nodes nor node degree distribution follows the power law. For scale-free approaches, this can cause errors in community detection. On the other hand, our method can handle this case correctly because our algorithm contains both scale-free and non scale-free approaches. To evaluate our method, we use NMI - Normalized Mutual Information - to measure our results on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing with both scale-free and non scale-free community detection methods. The results show that, our method can perform almost equal or better on both scale-free and non scale-free networks.},

abstract = {Group modeling is the process that combines multiple user models into a single model. In group recommendation, this allows to derive a group preference for each item. It is known that the strategy used to model a group has to be chosen considering the domain in which the system operates. This paper evaluates group modeling strategies in a group recommendation scenario in which groups are detected by clustering users. Once users are clustered, strategies are tested, in order to find the one that allows to get the best accuracy. Experimental results show that clustering and group modeling are strongly connected. By producing group preferences that are equally distant from the individual preferences, the modeling strategy has the same role that the centroid has when users are clustered. This previously unknown link among the two tasks is essential in order to build accurate group recommendations.},

They significantly differ from traditional Web Service frameworks and have to cope with new challenges such as assisting consumers in specifying service requirements and providing effective decision support for service selection. Existing evaluation efforts within the scope of Semantic Web Services do not account for these user-specific requirements and hence are not appropriate for assessing the quality of solutions that are dedicated to end-users, i.e. service consumers. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a user-centered methodology for the evaluation of Semantic Web Service retrieval and demonstrating its feasibility.},

abstract = {Reducing cognitive overhead is one way to ensure fast and easy web-navigation for users. We present here an automated navigation-support tool for websites. Whenever a user visits a website for searching some information, the tool will suggest relevant links to click, where they can find desired information on that website. The tool is based on a new cognitive model CoLiDeS++Pic, which combines two related models, CoLiDeS+ and CoLiDeS+Pic. The model computes semantic similarity between the user goal and the website information using latent semantic analysis technique. It also takes into account the path adequacy, performs appropriate backtracking if required, and uses semantic information from pictures. In the current implementation, the tool is not fully automated because the semantic features of pictures have to be obtained manually. To evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, we conducted an experiment with tool support and multi-tasking as independent variables. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive impact of the tool support for time needed to perform search tasks, disorientation in navigation and task-accuracy. The navigation performance in time and disorientation of the users and answering questions are improved when provided with the tool support. Multi-tasking had no effect on time needed or answering questions, but we observed an unexpected positive effect on disorientation, suggesting that perhaps the participants were more motivated to perform primary task due to the assigned secondary task (monitoring a video at the same time), which resulted in less disorientation.},

There exist many research works that strive to answer the question "what items are the customers going to like" given their historic profiles. However, most of these works miss to take into account the time dimension and cannot respond efficiently when data are huge. In this paper, we study the problem of recommendations in the context of multi-relational stream mining. Our algorithm first separates customers based on their historic data into clusters. It then employs collaborative filtering (CF) to recommend new items to the customers based on their clustering structure. We evaluate our algorithm on two data sets, MovieLens and a synthetic data set.},

The email messages are divided into chronological batches (e.g. one per day). The user is asked to give the correct categories (labels) for the messages of the first batch and from then on the proposed algorithm decides when to ask for a new label, based on a clustering of the messages that is incrementally updated. We test different variants of the algorithm on a number of different datasets and show that it achieves very good results with only 2% of all email messages labelled by the user.},

We propose a new algorithm FOF-SP, a WAP-Tree based algorithm which combines an early prunning strategy called "Sibling Principle" from the literature and FOF (First Occurrence Forest) strategy. Experimental results revealed that FOF-SP finds patterns faster than previous WAP-Tree based algorithms PLWAP and FOF. Moreover, FOF-SP can mine patterns faster than PrefixSpan and as fast as LAPIN on real sequence databases from web usage mining and bioinformatics.},

Typically, the similarity measure that is used for such clustering methods takes into account the cooccurrence patterns of only pairs of items. In this work, we argue that examining the simultaneous cooccurrence patterns of a larger number of terms, is a better option when the corpus contains a set of closely related fine-grained topics. To this end, we treat the topic detection problem as a Frequent Pattern Mining problem and propose a novel algorithm for "soft" Frequent Pattern Mining. We test the proposed approach using three annotated datasets collected from Twitter and compare it to a set of algorithms that includes a graph-based feature-pivot approach that takes into account only cooccurrence patterns, a standard Frequent Pattern Mining algorithm and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The results indicate that SFPM is performing better than the other tested methods and show a clear improvement over the standard FPM approach.},

A number of experiments on real datasets at different density levels indicate that LLFR outperforms other state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods from a computational as well as a qualitative perspective. Our experimental results also show that its relative performance gains, compared to competing methods, increase as the data get sparser. This is true both when the sparsity is generalized -- as in the New Community Problem -- and in the very interesting case where the sparsity is localized in a small fraction of the dataset -- as in the New Users Problem.},

abstract = {Representing topological information for the Semantic Web often involves qualitative defined natural language terms such as "Into" or "Overlapping". This can be the case when exact coordinates of spatial regions are not available, they are incomplete or unreliable. Topological spatial relations are the most important aspect of spatial representation and reasoning, thus embedding such relations into an ontology along with their semantics as expressed using reasoning rules is an important issue. In this work we propose a representation of RCC-5 topological relations using OWL object properties and axioms, combined with reasoning rules expressed using SWRL embedded into the ontology.Three alternative representations are proposed and compared: the first is based on a straightforward implementation of the path consistency method for spatial reasoning, the second is an optimized version of the path consistency based representation implemented using an alternative representation of the topological equality relation and the third is based on the decomposition of RCC-5 relations to simpler ones. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work dealing with topological RCC-5 relations representation for the Semantic Web. In addition, our work improves the performance of topological RCC-8 relations reasoning when the best method, in terms of reasoning time, for RCC-5 relations is applied over RCC-8 relations.},

abstract = {Annotations are important for the description of any object. They give understanding about the object in a summary form. Annotations, unlike tags, are structured form of meta-data information. Best structured information is prepared by humans. However, given the large volume and variety of objects like images, videos and documents, to name a few, it is practically impossible to annotate all the objects in the world. In such a situation, automated approaches to subscribe semantically correct and structured annotations is an extremely important task. In this paper we have proposed a novel problem of semantic annotation of research datasets. Explosion in the usage of social media and various electronic devices has led to collection of huge volumes of datasets for scientific research. Although, most of the datasets are available online, the lack of semantic annotations/meta-data and the lack of a unified public repository has made it difficult for researchers to browse through the datasets even with popular search engines. In this work we propose an algorithmic approach to automate the task of annotating the datasets in structured and semantic manner. We have used knowledge from the World Wide Web and organized knowledge bases such as dbpedia, yago, freebase and wordnet to derive context and annotations for the research datasets. The proposed approach is evaluated on two real world datasets, namely, UCI dataset repository and SNAP dataset collections. Using various experimental setups we show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches. We also perform a case study to compare our results with Google search engine. We find that using the semantic annotations the search accuracy increases by 18% over the normal search for datasets.},

We show that, given a target concept defined through a DL-Lite^{N}_{bool} TBox, there exists a set of frequency constraints on boolean combinations of the concepts occurring in the TBox such that the target concept has a non-empty finite extension if and only if there exists a non-empty database which satisfies the constraints. As a consequence, the concept finite satisfiability problem is NP-complete for both logics. Furthermore, augmenting DL-Lite^{N}_{horn} and DL-Lite^{N}_{bool} TBoxes with frequency constraints on concept occurrence does not increase the complexity of the problems.},

However, in cases when database contents are exported into RDF, it is not always optimal or even necessary to dump the whole database contents every time. In this paper, the problem of incremental generation and storage of the resulting RDF graph is investigated. An implementation of the R2RML standard is used in order to express mappings that associate tuples from the source database to triples in the resulting RDF graph. Next, a methodology is proposed that enables incremental generation and storage of an RDF graph based on a source relational database, and it is evaluated through a set of performance measurements. Finally, a discussion is presented regarding the authors' most important findings and conclusions.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider knowledge bases that organize information using ontologies. Specifically, we investigate reasoning over a semantic web where the underlying knowledgebase covers linked data about science research that are being harvested from the Web and are supplemented and edited by community members. In the semantic web over which we want to reason, frequent changes occur in the underlying knowledge base, and less frequent changes occur in the underlying ontology or the rule set that governs the reasoning. Queries may be composed of mixtures of clauses answerable directly by access to the knowledge base or indirectly via reasoning applied to that base. Two common methods of reasoning over a knowledge base using first order logic are forward chaining and backward chaining. Forward chaining is suitable for frequent computation of answers with data that are relatively static whereas backward chaining is suitable when frequent changes occur in the underlying knowledge base. We introduce new optimization techniques to the backward-chaining algorithm. We show that these techniques together with the query-optimization reported on earlier, will allow us to actually outperform forward-chaining reasoners in scenarios where the knowledge base is subject to frequent change.},

By making use of the data within the Linking Open Data Cloud, this platform enables the development of new and sophisticated location-based services for the end consumer that also incorporate the semantics of a location rather than plain geospatial information. More importantly, it gives mobile network operators the opportunity to exploit their asset (being their network topology) for innovative services based on semantically enriched data analytics such as identifying location hotspots or traffic heat maps. The foundation of the OpenMobileNetwork is an ontology comprising static and dynamic network context facets that describe mobile and WiFi access point networks from a topological perspective (e.g., base stations, their locations and coverage areas). Within this paper, we present this ontology in detail and demonstrate its applicability in a power management scenario for mobile networks.},

The mathematical model stores data about the strength of the relationship between words expressed as a decimal number. Both structured data from WordNet, such as that the word "canine" is a hypernym (i.e., kind of) of the word "dog", and textual descriptions, such as that the definition of the word "dog" is: "a member of the genus Canis that has been domesticated by man since prehistoric times", are used in creating the graph. The quality of the graph data is validated by comparing the similarity of pairs of words using our software that uses the graph with results of studies that are performed with human subjects. To the best of our knowledge, our software produces better correlation with the results of both the Miller and Charles study and the WordSimilarity-353 study than any other published research.},

abstract = {Using crowdsourcing for gathering labels can be beneficial for supervised machine learning, if done in the right way. Crowdsourcing is more cost-effective and faster than employing experts for labeling the items needed as training examples. Unfortunately, the crowd produced labels are not always of a comparable quality. Therefore, different methods could be employed in order to assure label quality. One of them is redundancy, by gathering more than one label per item, from different assessors. In this paper we introduce a novel method for aggregating multiple crowdsourced binary labels, taking into account the worker's history and how well the worker agrees with the aggregated label. According to previously solved tasks, the worker expertise, or the confidence we have in his labels can be assessed. The computation of the aggregated crowd label is mutually reinforced by the assessment of the worker confidence. Besides a method for computing a hard nominal aggregated label, we also propose a soft label as an indicator of how much the labelers agree and how strong their labels are. Furthermore, we investigate whether or not worker confidence should depend on the provided label, whether discriminating between positive and negative answer quality can be beneficial. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, covering different domains and label gathering strategies. Moreover, we compare against other state of the art methods, showing the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Web structure mining is to extract knowledge from the hyperlink structure data of world wide webs for improving web design for clear content presentation and easy navigation. This paper presents a graph-based methodology for web structure mining. The structure of a website is firstly mapped onto a graph with its nodes representing web pages and links representing hyperlinks between pages and other websites. Then the characteristics of the web graph, such as, the degree of each node, density, connectivity, the closeness centralisation, and the node clusters, can be analysed quantitatively. The methodology is tested on the web structural data collected from 110 UK's university websites. After cleansing and pre-processing the data, the graphs were constructed and analysed to obtain the aforementioned properties for each web and other useful information, such as page size and the length of the optimal path as they both affect the navigability. Based on the evaluation of the properties, some guidelines and criteria are devised for quantifying the structural quality of the webs into five categories from very poor to very good. The average degree and the percentage of strongly connected component (SCC) pages together with the average distance were found to be the most important properties in determining the structural quality of a web.},

This provides an opportunity to apply data mining techniques on movement data in order to recognize people's daily activities without changing their routine. In this paper, we present a methodology for collecting and analysing user activity information with a smartphone application. This information can be further exploited in various applications ranging from m-health (e.g. fitness application) and transportation (e.g. user driving habits detection) to m-commerce (e.g. shopping recommendations). In order to demonstrate this methodology, we have developed GPSTracker a prototype application for Android phones, which collects position, speed, altitude and time information and performs real-time classification of user's movement. The processed information is collected in a private user folder, on a cloud storage service, and can be further processed in order to extract aggregate user habits, or in order to detect user activity over time and provide recommendations. We also provide a visualisation of user trajectories, as recorded and classified by GPSTracker application. We exploited all the possible sensors of the smartphone and employed additional geo-location data from public transportation services. Finally, we tested several movement classification algorithms and trajectory pattern analysis techniques in order to improve the performance of our activity recognition process.},

Recently Japanese people have more interest in well-being issues, and a number of the people try to walk regularly and further participate in city marathon races. It is not easy for the people, who do not usually exercise, to begin marathon running suddenly. We, in this paper, report the development and a preliminary evaluation of virtual marathon system to make people experience a marathon race easily and virtually using smartphones. We display a marathon course on a smartphone using Google maps and the Street view, and move an agent on the course according to the user's running distance measured by GPS. We, furthermore, introduce the pseudo simultaneous competition scheme to make users to compete with others running at different place and time. Competitor agents, which reflect the location of the other users using the system, appear on the screen of smartphone to encourage the user to do more physical activities.We performed a preliminary evaluation experiment to confirm the effectiveness of our system. As a result, it shows our system is more effective for the users who usually walk and run and the ones who are familiar with the marathon course. On the other hand, the pseudo simultaneous competition scheme did not work well because the interactions among the competitors did not happen frequently due to the large difference of the users' physical capability. The result suggests that we need to develop artificial pacemaker agents which can keep encouraging users in a long run as our future work.},

abstract = {Multi-agent systems simulation is used to predict human behaviour in emergency evacuation cases. However, as human behaviour can change under the effect of emotions, it is essential to create models of artificial agents and simulations that mimic such behaviour in order to make prediction of the overall system performance. In emotional agents, the role of emotional contagion is important. Emotional contagion is a result of interaction between agents which could affect each others emotions. It is the case that in emergency situations, emotions (especially calmness, fear and panic) may propagate in various ways, depending on the agents personality type as well as other factors. In this paper, we review various methods of emotional contagion. In order to develop emotional agent simulation, we start from a formal state-based modelling method and devise a number of variations of known emotional contagion methods. NetLogo visual simulation is used, in which a number of experiments is conducted. The results are useful to demonstrate different behaviour of different emotional contagion models in the evacuation of an open square area.},

abstract = {While there are plenty of agent languages around, those who are targeted towards practical aspects are few and far between. Most alternatives serve mainly as experimentation vehicles for Distributed Artificial Intelligence (i.e. Jason, GOAL). It is our opinion that if agents are to get any mainstream attention they have to come with solutions to current problems like concurrency and distribution such as those found in real world scenarios, e.g. cloud and mobile systems. While some of the existing solutions partially address some of these issues, they do so in an unconvincing way.In this paper we propose Blueprint, an agent oriented programming language with built-in support for concurrency. Other key features are static typing and checked communication protocols which prevent a part of the errors that can appear in agents developed with existing languages. We walk through Blueprint's main features, shortcomings, and future extensions, motivating our design decisions.},

abstract = {Reaching consensus has long been regarded as one of the most important problems in distributed systems. Being able to do so under failures is addressed by the Paxos family of algorithms which is able to guarantee safety, while probabilistically satisfying progress. The role-based approach of Paxos makes it an ideal candidate for implementation using autonomous agents which can dynamically assume their part(s). This paper aims to bring the basic Paxos fault-tolerant algorithm into the multi-agent world by describing a system architecture and implementation under the Jade platform, and presents valuable experimental results for convergence in unfavorable cases.},

abstract = {Recently, research on emotional intelligence has advanced significantly from its theoretical basis, analytical studies and processing technology to exploratory application. The main intention of this paper is twofold. First, it will give an overview of the state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research. Then, it will suggest a systematic order of research activities and steps with the idea of proposing an adequate framework for real-life applications. We recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data analysis and pattern mining/recognition in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available emotional information and data sets. Finally, the paper will propose research activities in order to design an agent-based architecture, in which agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents. This kind of virtual emotional agent could be employed in intelligent human-computer interaction, within areas such as tourism, education, and virtual cultural exhibitions.},

The major advantage of agile development methods is that they take into account the way the human society works and interacts. This paper's purpose is to analyse one of the most used agile development methods, SCRUM, from the point of view of information flow and exchange.Having as a model a software company we shall create graphs that capture the transfer of information from different perspectives. In analysing the information flow through the networks we shall use one of the most recent developed methods, called Organisational Networks Analysis (ONA). ONA is based on the techniques used in Social Network Analysis, techniques used to analyse formal or informal networks that appear in an organisation.The information exchange graphs are created with the purpose to approximate three perspectives of information flow: Stakeholders' requests, between teams skill exchange, inside teams skill exchange; We shall prove that SCRUM's effects on organisational structures has important benefits on the transfer of information. To measure these benefits we shall compare SCRUM's organisational structure with the classical hierarchical structure.},

This paper will discuss applications relevant to urban areas with a focus on discussing research insight tools that draw on real-time public opinion sentiments in democratic societies. These tools will provide important data on what citizens know and want to know in normal circumstances. It also provides real-time analysis on development and humanitarian challenges within urban areas in times of crisis. The knowledge flows that are defined by citizen participation in government decisions can be exploited for other purposes, including the creation of smarter infrastructure (e.g., an electric grid or traffic management) aimed at improving the efficiency and quality of the services provided by local governments.},

abstract = {This paper examines the issues of policy and trust in the context of IT infrastructures for Smart Cities. This paper proposes that trusted Smart city policies can lead to the development of trusted foundational service underlying all smart city solutions. Such a set services are critical for architectural choices of data integration and use within smart city domains, and will lead to the development of a marketplace where service providers and consumers engage in a free and fully informed exchange to choose worthy and reliable experiences to address everything from reporting street light outage to identifying economic advantages during city planning. It argues that two usually mutually exclusive architectural meta-models; Centralization and Federation, are required to achieve a set of trusted foundational services. It reviews the large array of options for implementing the marketplace component of the foundational services to support scenarios varying from fully isolated well known analytics to the anonymous access that allows potential users to browse for services without any controls. It concludes that Trusted Policies are highly important as successful ingredients in the development of foundational services and the following developmental stage, and in the operations and maintenance stages for integrated Smart city systems. It is critical that Smart cities systems implement city-wide policies that improve and sustain trust that in turn help Smart cities manage across the multitude of systems that are in both developmental and operational stages simultaneously, and will be so for many decades to come.},

abstract = {The rapid rise of Web 2.0 technologies and the popularity of social media, together with the broad use of low cost smart devices, changed dramatically the way users receive information, but also gave them the ability to become significant contributors of disseminated data. The challenge now is to benefit from large volumes of data and collective intelligence, so as to detect what people think or discuss in virtual communities, at the time that an event happens or the information is spread. Our domain of interest is the Urban Air Quality (UAQ) and public health. We want to promote the potential use of social media as a real-time source of "sensing" the environmental load or the existing environmental condition that affects directly humans' quality of life. With the use of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), we analyze posts gathered from Twitter and we identify existing UAQ conditions, based on users' reports. Clusters of tweets with similar topics of discussion are formed. We additionally investigate the relations between citizens' reports and the corresponding, in time and location, actual observations of specific environmental characteristics. With a thorough investigation of SOM visualizations, we conclude that there is a positive correlation between personal observations and official data, highlighting thus the agreement among soft sensors' (users) and hard sensors' (monitoring sites) measurements.},
