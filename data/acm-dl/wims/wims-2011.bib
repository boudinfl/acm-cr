abstract = {Over the past 4 years, the semantic web activity has gained momentum with the widespread publishing of structured data as RDF. The Linked Data paradigm has therefore evolved from a practical research idea into a very promising candidate for addressing one of the biggest challenges in the area of the Semantic Web vision: the exploitation of the Web as a platform for data and information integration. To translate this initial success into a world-scale reality, a number of research challenges need to be addressed: the performance gap between relational and RDF data management has to be closed, coherence and quality of data published on the Web have to be improved, provenance and trust on the Linked Data Web must be established and generally the entrance barrier for data publishers and users has to be lowered. We discuss approaches for tackling these challenges and their integration into a mutual refinement cycle - the linked data 'washing machine'.},

abstract = {Why people process text with computers? It all started many years ago, with the main goal in minds of researchers, to understand the text. In the meantime, the area of text processing developed in many different directions whereby the original goals were often forgotten. Funny enough, it seems, in several decades of computerized processing of textual data, the solution to the 'text understanding' problem didn't evolve much compared to some other, easier and often more profitable problems to deal with (such as information retrieval/search, machine translation or information extraction). In this paper we touch various aspects of text processing along several dimensions: (a) how we represent the textual data, (b) what kind of algorithms and techniques we use, and (c) what kind of problems we solve on the top of text. Finally, it is interesting to observe various research communities dealing with textual data in different ways. Most of them are still rather fragmented and don't learn enough from each other - many of the ideas developed within one community don't cross borders of that community for too long.},

abstract = {When recommending news items, most of the traditional algorithms are based on TF-IDF, i.e., a term-based weighting method which is mostly used in information retrieval and text mining. However, many new technologies have been made available since the introduction of TF-IDF. This paper proposes a new method for recommending news items based on TF-IDF and a domain ontology. It is demonstrated that adapting TF-IDF with the semantics of a domain ontology, resulting in Concept Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (CF-IDF), yields better results than using the original TF-IDF method. CF-IDF is built and tested in Athena, a recommender extension to the Hermes news personalization framework. Athena employs a user profile to store concepts or terms found in news items browsed by the user. The framework recommends new articles to the user using a traditional TF-IDF recommender and the CF-IDF recommender. A statistical evaluation of both methods shows that the use of an ontology significantly improves the performance of a traditional recommender.},

abstract = {One of the most relevant problems with Information Retrieval (IR) softwares is the correct processing of complex lexical units, today also known as multiword units. The shortcomings are mainly due to the fact that such units are often considered as extemporaneous combinations of words retrievable by means of statistical routines. On the contrary, several linguistic studies, also dating back to the '60s, show that multiword units, and mainly compound nouns, are almost always fixed meaning units, with specific formal, morphological, grammatical and semantic characteristics. Furthermore, these units can be processed as dictionary entries, thus becoming concrete lingware tools useful to achieve efficient semantic information retrieval (IR).Therefore, in this paper we will focus on CATALOGA®, an automatic IR software which retrieves terminological information from digitized texts without any human intervention. CATALOGA® is actually configured as a stand-alone software which can be integrated in Web sites and portals to be used online. More specifically, we will describe its lingware and software characteristics, discussing their usage as a possible solution to current IR software limitations. The analytical procedure here described will prove itself appropriate for any type of digitized text, and will also represent a relevant support for the building and implementing of Semantic Web (SW) interactive platforms.},

abstract = {We introduce ELS, a new method for entity-level sentiment classification using sequence modeling by Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The CRF is trained to identify the sentiment of each word in a document, which is then used to determine the sentiment for the entity, based on where it appears in the text. Due to its sequential nature, the CRF classifier performs better than the common bag-of-words approaches, especially when we target the local sentiment in small parts of a larger document. Identifying the sentiment about a specific entity, mentioned in a blog post or a larger product review, is a special case of such local sentiment classification. Furthermore, the proposed approach performs well even in short pieces of text, where bag-of-words approaches usually fail, due to the sparseness of the resulting feature vector. We have implemented and tested the proposed method on a publicly available benchmark corpus of short product reviews in English. The results that we present in this paper improve significantly upon published results on the same data, thus confirming our intuition about the approach.},

Form understanding is key to automatically access and process all the relevant---and nowadays readily available---data.We introduce opal (ontology-based web pattern analysis with logic), a novel, purely logical approach to web form understanding: opal labels, structures, and groups form fields according to a domain-specific ontology linked through phenomenological rules to a logical representation of a DOM. The phenomenological rules describe how ontological concepts appear on the web; the ontology formalizes and structures common patterns of web pages observed in a domain. A unique feature of opal is that all domain-independent assumptions about web forms are represented in rules, whereas domain-specific assumptions are represented in the ontology. This yields a coherent logical framework, robust in face of changing web trends.We apply opal to a significant, randomly selected sample of UK real estate sites, showing that straightforward rules suffice to achieve high precision form understanding.},

The used mobile communication forums picture an example of user generated content in online discussion forums.Central to our system is a flexible visualization, which supports the analysis and exploration visually. Flexible means, that the ordering and the mapping of colors can be interactively changed by the analyst and the visualization is also capable to show the different structural levels of a user forum. The filter area offers beside well-known features many interesting features with respect to forum analysis, which we introduce in this paper. A detailed view of the particularly selected thread in the main visualization is presented in a third area. For a convenient manipulation and interaction we implemented intuitive mechanism. We describe the system and present various fictive user scenarios of different typical stakeholder tasks to illustrate the benefit of the system.},

This makes it possible for users to easily be aware of the main kinds of things in the dataset but also their main properties and the values the take while they perform faceted navigation.

System integration on the user interface level, e.g., in portals or mashups, allows users to access multiple applications in parallel and explore the information contained therein while reusing familiar and powerful user interfaces. Linked data can significantly add value by allowing uniform access to the data contained in the systems, and by letting reasoners discover hidden, non-explicit knowledge from that data.In this paper, we present an approach combining both paradigms. A framework for integrating user interfaces is enhanced by the Semantic Data Explorer, which is interlinked with the integrated applications in a hybrid view. With a quantitative user study conducted in the emergency management area, we show that hybrid visualizations of annotated data help gathering information from integrated systems, even for users who are not trained with ontologies and semantic networks.},

abstract = {In our everyday conversations, entities (persons, companies, etc.) are referred to by natural language identifiers (NLIs). Humans employ personal experience and situational context to interpret such identifiers. However, due to ambiguity, even humans run the risk of misinterpretations. In our prior work, we presented a novel method to resolve entity references in texts under the aspect of ambiguity. We explore ontological background knowledge represented in an RDF(S) graph. The different interpretation possibilities lead to different subgraphs of the underlying ontology, each subgraph describing one consistent, non-ambiguous interpretation of the ambiguous NLIs within the ontological knowledge base. Our domain-independent approach is based on spreading activation and uses a semantic relational ranking. In this paper, we suggest three extensions to our original algorithm. First, we process in a two-step interpretation---instead of the whole original input text---at first hand smaller text windows in order to get more precise reference interpretations through a smaller local text context. Second, we extend the spreading-activation algorithm within the RDF(S) graph towards a bidirectional exploration of edges which shall speed-up the algorithm. Third we use reinforcement learning in order to take advantage of re-occurring information. We present first experimental results with these algorithmic extensions and derive directions for future work.},

abstract = {The Eurovision contest has been the reference on european song contests for the past 50 years. Countries in the European Union can shows the rest of the participants their current music tendencies. This phenomena has been studied in domains like physic and social sciences to find correlations between contests and current political and socio-economy trends in EU. The inclusion of web and social technologies some years ago, have caused a disruption in the traditional voting system whereby the audience is encouraged to participate by casting votes for their favorite song. As a result, this system yields new, relevant information that may be extrapolated to social and political tendencies in Europe with a higher degree accuracy than by data collected using the previous jury-based system. This paper provides an initial data analysis in crowd behavior to assess the impact of the televote system, in the Eurovision voting dynamic, by focusing on two distinct five years periods that can successfully contrast each voting scheme. Analyzing these periods separately, we can observe results from the televoting contests and then compare to the jury to see if there is a change in voting patterns. Finally, we study the underlying community structure of the voting network using the Cluster Percolation Method and Edge Betweenness to discover stable core communities spanning a number of years in the contest. The clusters obtained using these algorithms are then used to compare how these stable communities have evolving during the considered periods.},

abstract = {The analysis of business/financial news has become a popular area of research because of the possibility to infer the future prospects of companies, economies and economic actors in general on information contained in the media. The classical approaches rely upon a "coarse" polarity classification of a news story, however this may not be an optimal solution because this form of classification assigns the same polarity to all of the entities contained in the news story. A news story which contains multiple entities may contain varying polarity for each individual entity. In addition,"coarse" classification may ignore sentiment modifiers which may alter the strength or direction of the story's polarity. News stories don't have a preassigned polarity label, consequently news stories must be manually assigned a polarity label. This process is slow, therefore there will be limited labelled data available. This lack of pre-classified data may inhibit the performance of learners which rely upon labelled data.This paper describes a rule based approach which identifies feature based sentiment and business event phrases. The phrases are captured with context free grammars which model the phrase as a triple. The triple contains: 1. Phrase subject (an economic actor), 2. A sentiment adjective or event verb and 3. An object (a property of the phrase subject). The captured phrases are limited by the semantic role of the subject. An annotated phrase can capture sentiment modifiers and negators. The scoring of the phrase incorporates all relevant linguistic features and consequently an accurate individual polarity score can be assigned to each relevant entity. The evaluation of the technique reports a recall of 0.71 and precision of 0.94 sentiment phrase annotation and 0.84 recall and 0.83 precision for event phrase annotation.},

Although a great attention has been paid to design semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on taxonomies, there has been little discussion about the design of semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on ontologies. In this paper we introduce a novel graph-based semantic relatedness approach to calculate semantic relatedness considering both hierarchical and non-hierarchical concepts in an ontology. In addition, our approach considers some important properties such as different relation types, concepts' depth and distance that play an essential role in measuring semantic relatedness. Three experimental studies are provided to first illustrate that our approach give a different results than other measures in the literature. Then, we compare our approach against existed methods using a benchmark dataset, and finally, evaluate our approach by using a real ontology and compare the predictions of our semantic relatedness approach against the human-subject judgment. The results in all the experiments show a considerable improvement against traditional taxonomy-based measures.},

From a linguistic and semantic point of view we get more coherent results through a linguistically motivated data mining than a statistical approach. We developed LR for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, composed by electronic dictionaries made of terminological multiword-expressions (Machine-Readable Form) and by local grammars (in the form of finite-state automata and transducers -- FSA/FST). Both parts of this lingware were built and applied according to Lexicon-Grammar (LG) formalization principles and methods. The mentioned language resources form the basis to develop an Information Retrieval System for e-Government. This device is a Semantic Web (SW) application, which will automatically recognize a given set of frequently-asked questions (from here on, FAQs) on European Community Information, previously formalized as syntactic patterns inside local grammars.},

Biologists need also to distinguish between new and prior information, especially to identify the real new output of a study. In order to respond to these needs, we propose a linguistic model based on the discursive categories. This model aims to develop the BioExcom tool for the automatic production of thematic sheets using the Contextual Exploration processing.

Many systems were previously proposed to make a web environment more accessible for the deaf people by providing signed expressions, i.e. translating written text into sign language animations and presenting them in a proper way, based on the observation that deaf users normally have much difficulty understanding text-based information as well as audio contents. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these systems with respect to discussed design criteria, and propose a system that presents a signing avatar for web page documents via a mobile device, which is expected to overcome the shortcomings of the previous systems and to improve the accessibility of deaf users to textual contents in a web environment. The proposed system has three main parts based on a client-server architecture: 1) a client that executes a web browser and transmits selected text to the server, 2) a server that takes text as input and translates it into signed expressions through a sign language generation module, and 3) a mobile device that displays signing animation transmitted from the server by streaming. We also present some linguistic issues raised by the difference between Korean and Korean Sign Language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to the use of a mobile device for web document access by the aurally challenged people.

Due to the nature of the e-learning material produced, it is lacking searchable data and metadata. Social Web technologies have been identified as one way to overcome this problem, because metadata will be generated by users. But still, the amount of metadata generated that way is not sufficient and the contextual information is missing. This information can be extracted from the Semantic Web, especially from Linked Data initiatives. This paper describes a workflow that utilizes the metadata generated by users to trigger the query of semantic datasets. These datasets are providing additional metadata, that can be extracted via an interface, which is publicly available. Thereby it is possible to supply new search strategies and achieve an extension of the search space for multimedia e-learning data. An extension of an existing search functionality and the similarity detection is finally described.},

abstract = {Interoperability between model-driven software technologies can become easier to achieve if the models and modelling languages used are made interoperable too. One way to achieve interoperability is to capture the semantics of modelling language constructs and model elements by mapping them to semantic models, such as ontologies. The paper proposes a set of extensions for XML-based modelling language specifications. The extensions have the potential to work equally well for model representations. The purpose is to support fine-grained and structured semantic annotations of languages and, eventually, of models. The proposal is inspired by the Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML (SAWSDL) recommendation and on the Unified Enterprise Modelling Language (UEML). The proposal is exemplified using the Action and ActionExecution constructs from UML 2.2.},

This paper presents a state-of-the-art survey on related problems in the fields of information retrieval, web page classification and directed search.As a solution to the EMRIS, this paper presents an innovative algorithm called the lost sheep. The lost sheep is specifically designed to work in web sites with of links, link texts and web pages. It works as a pre-classifier on link texts to decide if a web page is candidate for further evaluation.This paper also defines sound metrics to evaluated the EMRIS. The lost sheep outperforms all comparable algorithms both when it comes to maximizing accuracy and minimizing the number of downloaded pages.},

While SWRL can provide additional expressivity to OWL-based ontologies, it does not provide any way to handle uncertainty or imprecision. There is a pressing need to provide a standard-based, simple and functioning solution. We describe an extension of SWRL called SWRL-F that we believe can provides such a solution. SWRL-F is based on SWRL rule language and uses SWRL's strong semantic foundation as its formal underpinning. We extend it with a SWRL-F ontology to enable fuzzy reasoning in the rule base basing on the fuzzy control systems approach. The resulting language provides small but powerful set of fuzzy operations that do not introduce inconsistencies in the host ontology. We present it basing on the example of risk assessment in oil and gas industry which was a driving use case for this project.},

abstract = {Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic web specification that aims to support conceptual modeling of information about resources in the form of a triples of facts. In this paper, we note that, although RDF provides mechanisms to encode meta-information (such as source, trust, or certainty) about facts recorded in the knowledge base, existing RDF query languages and RDF stores fail to support key primitives needed in a large class of knowledge applications which associate utilities or costs on the available knowledge statements. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel R2DF framework for utility ranked resource descriptions. We first propose a simple ranked RDF (R2DF) specification to enhance RDF triples with an application specific weight (e.g. cost). We then propose a SPARankQL query language specification, which includes a set of novel primitives on top of the SPARQL language to express top-k queries using traditional query patterns as well as novel flexible path predicates. An extended query processor engine, AR2Q, leverages novel index structures to support efficient ranked path search and includes query optimization strategies based on two key metrics: (a) proximity and (b) sub-result inter-arrival time. Experiments show that the use of these two metrics has significant impacts on the performance of top-k queries over R2DF graphs: in particular, the proximity measure helps reduce the number of path matches that need to be considered, whereas the inter-arrival measure reduces the overall execution time significantly especially when used along with proximity. The proposed strategies help obtain query plans close to optimal.},

Dealing with the problem of semantic heterogeneity is a key point in the semantic web environment. The (semi) automatic generating of mappings with respect to uncertainty is a labor intensive and error prone task. While the confidence values of mappings themselves are uncertain, how can the aggregation method between them be certain? How can we model them in a certain manner? This paper introduces a new approach for modeling uncertainty in ontology matching on the basis of fuzzy set theory and then describes an iterative algorithm that exploits group decision making solutions to aggregate opinions of matchers into a group consensus one. Thus matching systems are combined to overcome contradictory and incomplete alignments, so that the quality and accuracy of final alignment will be improved.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) provide new ways for people to communicate with one another and to share content. OSNs have become quite popular among the general population but their rapid growth has raised concerns about privacy and security. Many predict that the OSNs of today provide a glimpse of the future Internet infrastructure. Whether or not that will be true is difficult to say but what is certain is that the privacy, integrity, and security issues and concerns need to be addressed now. In fact, the mainstream media have uncovered a rising number of potential and occurring problems, including: identity theft, unauthorized sharing of private information, malicious behavior of OSN services and applications, and so on. This paper addresses several important security and privacy issues by focusing on one of the core concepts of OSNs; the user profile, which both includes private and public information that the user shares to different parties and the customized security and privacy settings of the user. We present a method for comparing user profiles, by measuring the distance between the profiles in metric space, and for determining how well an OSN application conforms to user privacy settings. We report on a case study in which the proposed method is applied to Facebook to demonstrate the applicability of the method as well as to motivate its theoretical foundation.},

abstract = {Twitter is a micro-blogging service on the Web, where people can enter short messages, which then become visible to other users of the service. While the topics of these messages varies, there are a lot of messages where the users express their opinions about companies or products. Since the twitter service is very popular, the messages form a rich source of information for companies. They can learn with the help of data mining and sentiment analysis techniques, how their customers like their products or what is the general perception of the company. There is however a great obstacle for analyzing the data directly: as the company names are often ambiguous, one needs first to identify, which messages are related to the company. In this paper we address this question. We present various techniques to classify tweet messages, whether they are related to a given company or not, for example, whether a message containing the keyword "apple" is about the company Apple Inc.. We present simple techniques, which make use of company profiles, which we created semi-automatically from external Web sources. Our advanced techniques take ambiguity estimations into account and also automatically extend the company profiles from the twitter stream itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments.},

abstract = {Cross-enterprise collaboration has emerged as a key survival factor in today's global markets. Semantic Web technologies are the basis to establish enterprise interoperability including data mediation support and automatic composition of services. Capabilities of services are semantically described and reasoning techniques support the discovery and selection of services at run-time. These technologies are commonly based on precisely defined enterprise ontologies. In contrast to Semantic Web technologies that cover interactions between (technical) services, human collaborations emerge based on social preferences. Social networks have become a mass phenomenon. The fundamental aspects of these networks are to manage personal contacts and to share profile information with friends. These principles are increasingly harnessed in businesses and professional environments. In a manner similar to service-oriented systems, they enable flexible discovery and dynamic collaborations between participants. In this paper, we discuss the concept of social overlays for Web service based collaboration infrastructures. This mechanism enables information flows between actors in order to allow for flexible group formations in highly dynamic large-scale networks.},

This analysis aims in advancing our understanding of Web Social Media and their impact, and may be useful in creating feedback mechanisms for increasing user participation and sharing. For each of the three websites, we select five fundamental factors appearing in all content centered Web Social Media and we use regression analysis to calculate their correlation. We present findings of statistically important correlations among these key factors and we rank the discovered correlations according to the degree of their influence. Furthermore, we perform analysis of variance in distinct subgroups of the collected data and we discuss differences found in the characteristics of these subgroups and how these differences may affect correlation results.Although we acknowledge that correlation does not imply causality, the discovered correlations may be a first step towards discovering causality laws behind content contribution, commenting and the formulation of friendship relations. These causality laws are useful for boosting the user participation in social media.},

abstract = {In 2010 the first prototype of Share.TEC (www.share-tec.eu) repository system was developed. The system is designed as a highly flexible portal which is supposed to give access to a great variety of Teacher Education (TE) resources. At the center of the Share.TEC system is the repository system which stores metadata for TE resources. The resources are described and classified in detail, which allows the system to recommend certain resources to different users depending on their profiles. The basic purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which the predefined features of the system were developed in the first prototype and the extent to which the system meets the needs of the target users. For this purpose the system was initially tested by the authors of this paper and the prototype has now been offered for testing to a group of 12 volunteer university and school teachers. Having many years in teaching and training environment the teachers belong to the group of target users which can produce relevant and comprehensive interaction with the system. The feedback will be summarized in this paper and will become a milestone for the final release of the system.},

In our tests we have a dataset of users who give ratings for some movies; we hide some values from the dataset, and we try to predict them again using its remaining portion (the so-called "leave-n-out approach").In order to use an Information Retrieval algorithm, we reformulate this Recommender Systems problem in this way: a user corresponds to a document, a movie corresponds to a term, the active user (whose rating we want to predict) plays the role of the query, and the ratings are used as weigths, in place of the weighting schema of the original IR algorithm.The output is the ranking list of the documents ("users") relevant for the query ("active user"). We use the ratings of these users, weighted according to the rank, to predict the rating of the active user. We carry out the comparison by means of a typical metric, namely the accuracy of the predictions returned by the algorithm, and we compare this to the real ratings from users. In our first tests, we use two different Information Retrieval algorithms: LSPR, a recently proposed model based on Discrete Fourier Transform, and a simple vector space model.},

abstract = {The vast amounts of knowledge in the biomedical domain have paved the way for a new paradigm in biological research called Systems Biology, essentially an approach that relies on the integration of all available knowledge of a biological system in a single model. This approach promotes a comprehensive understanding of biological systems, driven by data integration and mathematical modelling. However, the sheer volume, variation and complexity of the current biological data pose a number of hurdles in knowledge management that need to be overcome. The Semantic Web offers various solutions to these challenges. With our initiative, named Semantic Systems Biology (SSB), we augment the systems biology approach with semantic web technologies to enable smooth data integration, rigorous knowledge representation, efficient querying, and hypothesis generation. Here we present an overview of the projects associated with the SSB initiative. Access to our resources developed within the SSB frame is provided on our website: http://www.semantic-systems-biology.org.},

abstract = {Currently, the OBO Foundry plays an important role by setting guidelines to formalise the concepts within the biomedical domain. The ontologies within the OBO Foundry are usually represented in the OBO ontology language. While being human-readable, this language lacks the computational rigour required for the Semantic Web (SW). Consequently, the RDF and OWL languages, both fundamental components of the SW technology stack, are being increasingly adopted by the biomedical community to exchange biological knowledge in a computer intelligible form. Some of the OBO- formatted ontologies have been made available in OWL, thus signalling a move towards the SW. OWL provides support for automated reasoning, which is its raison d'\^{e}tre. Unfortunately, automated reasoning on the massive volumes of data that are typical of the biomedical domain is riddled with performance limitations. Due to consistent support for the SPARQL specification in triple store implementations, as well as the ability to simulate some types of reasoning with pre-computed closures, RDF has evolved into a language of choice for knowledge exchange within the framework of the SW. Here, we discuss the need to establish a foundry charged with the task of harmonizing biomedical RDF resources, acting along the same lines as the OBO Foundry. To substantiate the need for an RDF Foundry, we provide the outcome of a small survey we have conducted to highlight the domain coverage, redundancies, and comprehensiveness of results obtained from a few representative distributed resources available today.},

abstract = {With the vast amount of information available online, searching results for a given query requires the user to go through many titles and snippets. This searching time can be reduced by clustering search results into clusters so that the user can select the relevant cluster at a glance by looking at the cluster labels. For web page clustering, terms (features) can be extracted from different parts of the web page. Giansalvatore, Salvatore and Alessandro have extracted terms from the entire web page for clustering. Number of terms returned in this case is more and it produces lengthy vectors. To reduce the size of the vector, Stanis law Osinski et al., and Ahmed Sameh and Amar Kadray have considered terms from the snippets.In this work, terms are extracted from the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), Title tag and Meta tag to cluster the web documents. The reason for selecting these parts of a web page is that they have the keywords which are available in a web page. Among existing clustering algorithms, K-means algorithm is a simple algorithm and can be easily implemented for solving many practical problems. The disadvantage of K-means algorithm is the random selection of initial centroids and this paper selects initial centroids by calculating the midpoint. The proposed method of clustering is compared with Snippet based clustering and URL and Tag content based traditional K-means clustering in terms of Intra-cluster distance and Inter-cluster distance.},

The potential benefits have generated the need to be the first one to achieve an enough level of autonomy to provide customized services for both users and product providers.But the true revolution will arrive when social networks become "smart". To build these new intelligent systems we propose to use Artificial Intelligence techniques, more concretely plan recognition.
