abstract = {We study computational and sample complexity of parameter and structure learning in graphical models. Our main result shows that the class of factor graphs with bounded factor size and bounded connectivity can be learned in polynomial time and polynomial number of samples, assuming that the data is generated by a network in this class. This result covers both parameter estimation for a known network structure and structure learning. It implies as a corollary that we can learn factor graphs for both Bayesian networks and Markov networks of bounded degree, in polynomial time and sample complexity. Unlike maximum likelihood estimation, our method does not require inference in the underlying network, and so applies to networks where inference is intractable. We also show that the error of our learned model degrades gracefully when the generating distribution is not a member of the target class of networks.},

abstract = {It is well known that there may be many causal explanations that are consistent with a given set of data. Recent work has been done to represent the common aspects of these explanations into one representation. In this paper, we address what is less well known: how do the relationships common to every causal explanation among the observed variables of some DAG process change in the presence of latent variables? Ancestral graphs provide a class of graphs that can encode conditional independence relations that arise in DAG models with latent and selection variables. In this paper we present a set of orientation rules that construct the Markov equivalence class representative for ancestral graphs, given a member of the equivalence class. These rules are sound and complete. We also show that when the equivalence class includes a DAG, the equivalence class representative is the essential graph for the said DAG.},

publisher = {AUAI Press},
address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {When training data is sparse, more domain knowledge must be incorporated into the learning algorithm in order to reduce the effective size of the hypothesis space. This paper builds on previous work in which knowledge about qualitative monotonicities was formally represented and incorporated into learning algorithms (e.g., Clark &amp; Matwin's work with the CN2 rule learning algorithm). We show how to interpret knowledge of qualitative influences, and in particular of monotonicities, as constraints on probability distributions, and to incorporate this knowledge into Bayesian network learning algorithms. We show that this yields improved accuracy, particularly with very small training sets (e.g. less than 10 examples).},

abstract = {Inferring from inconsistency and making decisions are two problems which have always been treated separately by researchers in Artificial Intelligence.

Recently, other argumentation systems [3, 4, 8] have been defined for making decisions under uncertainty.The aim of this paper is to present a general argumentation framework in which both inferring from inconsistency and decision making are captured.The proposed framework can be used for decision under uncertainty, multiple criteria decision, rule-based decision and finally case-based decision. Moreover, works on classical decision suppose that the information about environment is coherent, and this no longer required by this general framework.},

abstract = {Correlated equilibrium (Aumann, 1974) generalizes Nash equilibrium to allow correlation devices. Aumann showed an example of a game, and of a correlated equilibrium in this game, in which the agents' surplus (expected sum of payoffs) is greater than their surplus in all mixed-strategy equilibria. Following the idea initiated by the price of anarchy literature (Koutsoupias &amp; Papadimitriou, 1999; Papadimitriou, 2001) this suggests the study of two major measures for the value of correlation in a game with non-negative payoffs:1. The ratio between the maximal surplus obtained in a correlated equilibrium to the maximal surplus obtained in a mixed-strategy equilibrium. We refer to this ratio as the mediation value.2. The ratio between the maximal surplus to the maximal surplus obtained in a correlated equilibrium. We refer to this ratio as the enforcement value.In this work we initiate the study of the mediation and enforcement values, providing several general results on the value of correlation as captured by these concepts. We also present a set of results for the more specialized case of congestion games (Rosenthal, 1973), a class of games that received a lot of attention in the recent literature.},

abstract = {Structured utility models are essential for the effective representation and elicitation of complex multiattribute utility functions. Generalized additive independence (GAI) models provide an attractive structural model of user preferences, offering a balanced tradeoff between simplicity and applicability. While representation and inference with such models is reasonably well understood, elicitation of the parameters of such models has been studied less from a practical perspective. We propose a procedure to elicit GAI model parameters using only "local" utility queries rather than "global" queries over full outcomes. Our local queries take full advantage of GAI structure and provide a sound framework for extending the elicitation procedure to settings where the uncertainty over utility parameters is represented probabilistically. We describe experiments using a myopic value-of-information approach to elicitation in a large GAI model.},

This paper deals with the problem of clarifying how the variance of a response variable would have changed if a treatment variable were assigned to some value (counterfactually), given that a set of variables is observed (actually). In order to achieve this aim, we reformulate the formulas of the counterfactual distribution proposed by Balke and Pearl (1995) through both the total effects and a covariance matrix of observed variables. We further extend the framework of Balke and Pearl (1995) from point observations to interval observations, and from an unconditional plan to a conditional plan. The results of this paper enable us to clarify the properties of counter-factual distribution and establish an optimal plan.},

abstract = {The Bayesian Logic (BLOG) language was recently developed for defining first-order probability models over worlds with unknown numbers of objects.

This paper extends BLOG by adopting generative processes over function spaces — known as nonparametrics in the Bayesian literature. We introduce syntax for reasoning about arbitrary collections of objects, and their properties, in an intuitive manner. By exploiting exchangeability, distributions over unknown objects and their attributes are cast as Dirichlet processes, which resolve difficulties in model selection and inference caused by varying numbers of objects. We demonstrate these concepts with application to citation matching.},

year = {2005},
isbn = {0974903914},
publisher = {AUAI Press},
address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {A model of the world built from sensor data may be incorrect even if the sensors are functioning correctly. Possible causes include the use of inappropriate sensors (e.g. a laser looking through glass walls), sensor inaccuracies accumulate (e.g. localization errors), the a priori models are wrong, or the internal representation does not match the world (e.g. a static occupancy grid used with dynamically moving objects). We are interested in the case where the constructed model of the world is flawed, but there is no access to the ground truth that would allow the system to see the discrepancy, such as a robot entering an unknown environment. This paper considers the problem of determining when something is wrong using only the sensor data used to construct the world model. It proposes 11 interpretation inconsistency indicators based on the Dempster-Shafer conflict metric, Con, and evaluates these indicators according to three criteria: ability to distinguish true inconsistency from sensor noise (classification), estimate the magnitude of discrepancies (estimation), and determine the source(s) (if any) of sensing problems in the environment (isolation). The evaluation is conducted using data from a mobile robot with sonar and laser range sensors navigating indoor environments under controlled conditions. The evaluation shows that the Gambino indicator performed best in terms of estimation (at best 0.77 correlation), isolation, and classification of the sensing situation as degraded (7% false negative rate) or normal (0% false positive rate). While the evaluation is limited to 2D world models, the use of the Dempster-Shafer conflict metric to detect significant inconsistencies in data appears useful and could lead to systems which autonomously switch information sources to ensure the best mission performance, learn the relative contribution and reliability of sources for different environments, and reason about which sources to use under what circumstances.},

abstract = {Planning in adversarial and uncertain environments can be modeled as the problem of devising strategies in stochastic perfect information games. These games are generalizations of Markov decision processes (MDPs): there are two (adversarial) players, and a source of randomness. The main practical obstacle to computing winning strategies in such games is the size of the state space. In practice therefore, one typically works with abstractions of the model. The difficulty is to come up with an abstraction that is neither too coarse to remove all winning strategies (plans), nor too fine to be intractable. In verification, the paradigm of counterexample-guided abstraction refinement has been successful to construct useful but parsimonious abstractions automatically. We extend this paradigm to probabilistic models (namely, perfect information games and, as a special case, MDPs). This allows us to apply the counterexample-guided abstraction paradigm to the AI planning problem. As special cases, we get planning algorithms for MDPs and deterministic systems that automatically construct system abstractions.},

address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {Voting is a very general method of preference aggregation. A voting rule takes as input every voter's vote (typically, a ranking of the alternatives), and produces as output either just the winning alternative or a ranking of the alternatives. One potential view of voting is the following. There exists a "correct" outcome (winner/ranking), and each voter's vote corresponds to a noisy perception of this correct outcome. If we are given the noise model, then for any vector of votes, we can compute the maximum likelihood estimate of the correct outcome. This maximum likelihood estimate constitutes a voting rule. In this paper, we ask the following question: For which common voting rules does there exist a noise model such that the rule is the maximum likelihood estimate for that noise model? We require that the votes are drawn independently given the correct outcome (we show that without this restriction, all voting rules have the property). We study the question both for the case where outcomes are winners and for the case where outcomes are rankings. In either case, only some of the common voting rules have the property. Moreover, the sets of rules that satisfy the property are incomparable between the two cases (satisfying the property in the one case does not imply satisfying it in the other case).},

Although solutions to these problems are intractable in general, there might be special cases, such as structured POMDPs, which can be solved efficiently. A natural and possibly efficient way to represent a POMDP is through the predictive state representation (PSR) — a representation which recently has been receiving increasing attention.In this work, we relate POMDPs to multiplicity automata — showing thatPOMDPs can be represented by multiplicity automata with no increase in the representation size. Furthermore, we show that the size of the multiplicity automaton is equal to the rank of the predictive state representation. Therefore, we relate both the predictive state representation and POMDPs to the well-founded multiplicity automata literature.Based on the multiplicity automata representation, we provide a planning algorithm which is exponential only in the multiplicity automata rank rather than the number of states of the POMDP. As a result, whenever the predictive state representation is logarithmic in the standard POMDP representation, our planning algorithm is efficient.},

Our method accommodates not just the standard signs, but provides for context-specific signs as well. We show how the various signs translate into order constraints on the network parameters and how isotonic regression can be used to compute order-constrained estimates from the available data. Our experimental results show that taking prior knowledge about the signs of influences into account leads to an improved fit of the true distribution, especially when only a small sample of data is available. Moreover, the computed estimates are guaranteed to be consistent with the specified signs, thereby resulting in a network that is more likely to be accepted by experts in its domain of application.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of learning Bayesian network classifiers that maximize the margin over a set of classification variables. We find that this problem is harder for Bayesian networks than for undirected graphical models like maximum margin Markov networks. The main difficulty is that the parameters in a Bayesian network must satisfy additional normalization constraints that an undirected graphical model need not respect. These additional constraints complicate the optimization task. Nevertheless, we derive an effective training algorithm that solves the maximum margin training problem for a range of Bayesian network topologies, and converges to an approximate solution for arbitrary network topologies. Experimental results show that the method can demonstrate improved generalization performance over Markov networks when the directed graphical structure encodes relevant knowledge. In practice, the training technique allows one to combine prior knowledge expressed as a directed (causal) model with state of the art discriminative learning methods.},

We consider an extension of this framework where there is uncertainty as to which of a number of likelihood functions is appropriate, and discuss how one formal approach to defining evidence, which views evidence as a function from priors to posteriors, can be generalized to accommodate this uncertainty.},

The resulting algorithm E-IPFP is further developed to D-IPFP, which reduces the computational cost by decomposing a global E-IPFP into a set of smaller local E-IPFP problems. Limited analysis is provided, including the convergence proofs of the two algorithms. Computer experiments were conducted to validate the algorithms.

The relationship between the threshold value used in the proposed test and its size and power is deduced from the approximation. The mean delay time before a change is detected is estimated using the average sample number of a SPRT. The performance of the test using various threshold values is examined on five different data stream scenarios simulated using two synthetic data sets. Finally, experimental results show that the test is effective in detecting changes in time-varying data streams simulated using three benchmark data sets.},

Indeed, different abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel method for selecting logical hidden Markov models from data called SAGEM. SAGEM combines generalized expectation maximization, which optimizes parameters, with structure search for model selection using inductive logic programming refinement operators. We provide convergence and experimental results that show SAGEM's effectiveness.},

abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo techniques are useful for state estimation in non-linear, non-Gaussian dynamic models. These methods allow us to approximate the joint posterior distribution using sequential importance sampling. In this framework, the dimension of the target distribution grows with each time step, thus it is necessary to introduce some resampling steps to ensure that the estimates provided by the algorithm have a reasonable variance. In many applications, we are only interested in the marginal filtering distribution which is defined on a space of fixed dimension. We present a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm called the Marginal Particle Filter which operates directly on the marginal distribution, hence avoiding having to perform importance sampling on a space of growing dimension. Using this idea, we also derive an improved version of the auxiliary particle filter. We show theoretic and empirical results which demonstrate a reduction in variance over conventional particle filtering, and present techniques for reducing the cost of the marginal particle filter with N particles from O(N2) to O(N log N).},

In this paper, we focus on the case of binary variables with pairwise couplings, and establish stronger properties of TRW fixed points that satisfy only the milder condition of weak tree agreement (WTA). First, we demonstrate how it is possible to identify part of the optimal solution—i.e., a provably optimal solution for a subset of nodes— without knowing a complete solution. Second, we show that for submodular functions, a WTA fixed point always yields a globally optimal solution. We establish that for binary variables, any WTA fixed point always achieves the global maximum of the linear programming relaxation underlying the TRW method.},

Classical first-order logic is sufficiently expressive, but lacks a coherent plausible reasoning capability. Recent years have seen the emergence of a variety of approaches to integrating first-order logic, probability, and machine learning. This paper presents Multi-entity Bayesian networks (MEBN), a formal system that integrates First Order Logic (FOL) with Bayesian probability theory. MEBN extends ordinary Bayesian networks to allow representation of graphical models with repeated sub-structures, and can express a probability distribution over models of any consistent, finitely axiomatizable first-order theory.

To remedy this situation, we derive conditions that guarantee that the optimal expected utilities of the total plan-execution reward exist and are finite for fully observable Markov decision process models with non-linear utility functions. In case of Markov decision process models with both positive and negative rewards, most of our results hold for stationary policies only, but we conjecture that they can be generalized to non-stationary policies.},

Based on the differential semantics we describe how variable propagation in the LARP architecture may give access to additional partial derivatives. The cautious LARP (cLARP) scheme is derived to produce a flexible cLARP equilibrium that offers additional opportunities for calculating single and multi dimensional partial derivatives of the evidence and subsets of the evidence from a single propagation. The results of an empirical evaluation illustrates how the access to a largely increased number of partial derivatives comes at a low computational cost.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a fundamental issue central to approximation methods for solving large Markov decision processes (MDPs): how to automatically learn the underlying representation for value function approximation? A novel theoretically rigorous framework is proposed that automatically generates geometrically customized orthonormal sets of basis functions, which can be used with any approximate MDP solver like least-squares policy iteration (LSPI). The key innovation is a coordinate-free representation of value functions, using the theory of smooth functions on a Riemannian manifold. Hodge theory yields a constructive method for generating basis functions for approximating value functions based on the eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint (Laplace-Beltrami) operator on manifolds. In effect, this approach performs a global Fourier analysis on the state space graph to approximate value functions, where the basis functions reflect the large-scale topology of the underlying state space. A new class of algorithms called Representation Policy Iteration (RPI) are presented that automatically learn both basis functions and approximately optimal policies. Illustrative experiments compare the performance of RPI with that of LSPI using two handcoded basis functions (RBF and polynomial state encodings).},

abstract = {The need to measure sequence similarity arises in information extraction, object identity, data mining, biological sequence analysis, and other domains. This paper presents discriminative string-edit CRFs, a finite-state conditional random field model for edit sequences between strings. Conditional random fields have advantages over generative approaches to this problem, such as pair HMMs or the work of Ristad and Yianilos, because as conditionally-trained methods, they enable the use of complex, arbitrary actions and features of the input strings. As in generative models, the training data does not have to specify the edit sequences between the given string pairs. Unlike generative models, however, our model is trained on both positive and negative instances of string pairs. We present positive experimental results on several data sets.},

address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for minimizing the difference between two sub-modular functions using a variational framework which is based on (an extension of) the concave-convex procedure [17]. Because several commonly used metrics in machine learning, like mutual information and conditional mutual information, are submodular, the problem of minimizing the difference of two submodular problems arises naturally in many machine learning applications. Two such applications are learning discriminatively structured graphical models and feature selection under computational complexity constraints. A commonly used metric for measuring discriminative capacity is the EAR measure which is the difference between two conditional mutual information terms. Feature selection taking complexity considerations into account also fall into this framework because both the information that a set of features provide and the cost of computing and using the features can be modeled as submodular functions. This problem is NP-hard, and we give a polynomial time heuristic for it. We also present results on synthetic data to show that classifiers based on discriminative graphical models using this algorithm can significantly outperform classifiers based on generative graphical models.},

abstract = {Boosted decision trees typically yield good accuracy, precision, and ROC area. However, because the outputs from boosting are not well calibrated posterior probabilities, boosting yields poor squared error and cross-entropy. We empirically demonstrate why AdaBoost predicts distorted probabilities and examine three calibration methods for correcting this distortion: Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression, and Logistic Correction. We also experiment with boosting using log-loss instead of the usual exponential loss. Experiments show that Logistic Correction and boosting with log-loss work well when boosting weak models such as decision stumps, but yield poor performance when boosting more complex models such as full decision trees. Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, however, significantly improve the probabilities predicted by both boosted stumps and boosted trees. After calibration, boosted full decision trees predict better probabilities than other learning methods such as SVMs, neural nets, bagged decision trees, and KNNs, even after these methods are calibrated.},

A CTBN is a directed (possibly cyclic) dependency graph over a set of variables, each of which represents a finite state continuous time Markov process whose transition model is a function of its parents. We address the problem of learning the parameters and structure of a CTBN from partially observed data. We show how to apply expectation maximization (EM) and structural expectation maximization (SEM) to CTBNs. The availability of the EM algorithm allows us to extend the representation of CTBNs to allow a much richer class of transition durations distributions, known as phase distributions. This class is a highly expressive semi-parametric representation, which can approximate any duration distribution arbitrarily closely. This extension to the CTBN framework addresses one of the main limitations of both CTBNs and DBNs — the restriction to exponentially / geometrically distributed duration. We present experimental results on a real data set of people's life spans, showing that our algorithm learns reasonable models — structure and parameters — from partially observed data, and, with the use of phase distributions, achieves better performance than DBNs.},

A CTBN is a directed (possibly cyclic) dependency graph over a set of variables, each of which represents a finite state continuous time Markov process whose transition model is a function of its parents. As shown previously, exact inference in CTBNs is intractable. We address the problem of approximate inference, allowing for general queries conditioned on evidence over continuous time intervals and at discrete time points. We show how CTBNs can be parameterized within the exponential family, and use that insight to develop a message passing scheme in cluster graphs and allows us to apply expectation propagation to CTBNs. The clusters in our cluster graph do not contain distributions over the cluster variables at individual time points, but distributions over trajectories of the variables throughout a duration. Thus, unlike discrete time temporal models such as dynamic Bayesian networks, we can adapt the time granularity at which we reason for different variables and in different conditions.},

We focus on self-confirming price distribution predictions, which by definition turn out to be correct when all agents bid decision-theoretically based on them. Bidding based on these is provably not optimal in general, but our experimental evidence indicates the strategy can be quite effective compared to other known methods.},

abstract = {Two types of probabilistic maps are popular in the mobile robotics literature: occupancy grids and geometric maps. Occupancy grids have the advantages of simplicity and speed, but they represent only a restricted class of maps and they make incorrect independence assumptions. On the other hand, current geometric approaches, which characterize the environment by features such as line segments, can represent complex environments compactly. However, they do not reason explicitly about occupancy, a necessity for motion planning; and, they lack a complete probability model over environmental structures. In this paper we present a probabilistic mapping technique based on polygonal random fields (PRF), which combines the advantages of both approaches. Our approach explicitly represents occupancy using a geometric representation, and it is based upon a consistent probability distribution over environments which avoids the incorrect independence assumptions made by occupancy grids. We show how sampling techniques for PRFs can be applied to localized laser and sonar data, and we demonstrate significant improvements in mapping performance over occupancy grids.},

abstract = {Systems such as sensor networks and teams of autonomous robots consist of multiple autonomous entities that interact with each other in a distributed, asynchronous manner. These entities need to keep track of the state of the system as it evolves. Asynchronous systems lead to special challenges for monitoring, as nodes must update their beliefs independently of each other and no central coordination is possible. Furthermore, the state of the system continues to change as beliefs are being updated. Previous approaches to developing distributed asynchronous probabilistic reasoning systems have used static models. We present an approach using dynamic models, that take into account the way the system changes state over time. Our approach, which is based on belief propagation, is fully distributed and asynchronous, and allows the world to keep on changing as messages are being sent around. Experimental results show that our approach compares favorably to the factored frontier algorithm.},

Revision operators can be classified into two different families: the model-based ones and the formula-based ones. So the revision-based approach has two different versions according to which family of revision operators is chosen. Two particular revision operators are considered, one is the Dalal's revision operator, which is a model-based revision operator, and the other is the cardinality-maximal based revision operator, which is a formula-based revision operator. When the Dalal's revision operator is chosen, the revision-based approach is independent of the syntactic form in each stratum and it captures some notion of minimal change. When the cardinality-maximal based revision operator is chosen, the revision-based approach is equivalent to the DMA approach. We also show that both approaches are computationally easier than the DMA approach.},

abstract = {Studying the effects of one-way variation of any number of parameters on any number of output probabilities quickly becomes infeasible in practice, especially if various evidence profiles are to be taken into consideration. To provide for identifying the parameters that have a potentially large effect prior to actually performing the analysis, we need properties of sensitivity functions that are independent of the network under study, of the available evidence, or of both. In this paper, we study properties that depend upon just the probability of the entered evidence. We demonstrate that these properties provide for establishing an upper bound on the sensitivity value for a parameter; they further provide for establishing the region in which the vertex of the sensitivity function resides, thereby serving to identify parameters with a low sensitivity value that may still have a large impact on the probability of interest for relatively small parameter variations.},

Finally, we compare and contrast various of the algorithms in the DLR hierarchy on spin-glass problems.

abstract = {Models of dynamical systems based on predictive state representations (PSRs) are defined strictly in terms of observable quantities, in contrast with traditional models (such as Hidden Markov Models) that use latent variables or state-space representations. In addition, PSRs have an effectively infinite memory, allowing them to model some systems that finite memory-based models cannot. Thus far, PSR models have primarily been developed for domains with discrete observations. Here, we develop the Predictive Linear-Gaussian (PLG) model, a class of PSR models for domains with continuous observations. We show that PLG models subsume Linear Dynamical System models (also called Kalman filter models or state-space models) while using fewer parameters. We also introduce an algorithm to estimate PLG parameters from data, and contrast it with standard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms used to estimate Kalman filter parameters. We show that our algorithm is a consistent estimation procedure and present preliminary empirical results suggesting that our algorithm outperforms EM, particularly as the model dimension increases.},

Continuing this line of research, we show how to discover the complete causal structure of continuous-valued data, under the assumptions that (a) the data generating process is linear, (b) there are no unobserved confounders, and (c) disturbance variables have non-gaussian distributions of non-zero variances. The solution relies on the use of the statistical method known as independent component analysis (ICA), and does not require any pre-specified time-ordering of the variables.

We demonstrate the overall approach on a reduced version of poker using Dirichlet priors and then on the full game of Texas hold'em using a more informed prior.

Conditional training is even more difficult, because the partition function depends not only on the parameters, but also on the observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training example. An appealing idea for such models is to independently train a local undirected classifier over each clique, afterwards combining the learned weights into a single global model. In this paper, we show that this piecewise method can be justified as minimizing a new family of upper bounds on the log partition function. On three natural-language data sets, piecewise training is more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often performs comparably to global training using belief propagation.},

address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {One of the basic tasks for Bayesian networks (BNs) is that of learning a network structure from data. The BN-learning problem is NP-hard, so the standard solution is heuristic search. Many approaches have been proposed for this task, but only a very small number outperform the baseline of greedy hill-climbing with tabu lists; moreover, many of the proposed algorithms are quite complex and hard to implement. In this paper, we propose a very simple and easy-to-implement method for addressing this task. Our approach is based on the well-known fact that the best network (of bounded in-degree) consistent with a given node ordering can be found very efficiently. We therefore propose a search not over the space of structures, but over the space of orderings, selecting for each ordering the best network consistent with it. This search space is much smaller, makes more global search steps, has a lower branching factor, and avoids costly acyclicity checks. We present results for this algorithm on both synthetic and real data sets, evaluating both the score of the network found and in the running time. We show that ordering-based search outperforms the standard baseline, and is competitive with recent algorithms that are much harder to implement.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increased need for the use of active systems - systems required to act automatically based on events, or changes in the environment. Such systems span many areas, from active databases to applications that drive the core business processes of today's enterprises. However, in many cases, the events to which the system must respond are not generated by monitoring tools, but must be inferred from other events based on complex temporal predicates. In addition, in many applications, such inference is inherently uncertain. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for knowledge representation and reasoning enabling such event inference. Based on probability theory, we define the representation of the associated uncertainty. In addition, we formally define the probability space, and show how the relevant probabilities can be calculated by dynamically constructing a Bayesian network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables taking such uncertainty into account in the context of active systems. Therefore, our contribution is twofold: We formally define the representation and semantics of event composition for probabilistic settings, and show how to apply these extensions to the quantification of the occurrence probability of events. These results enable any active system to handle such uncertainty.},

title = {Structured Region Graphs: Morphing EP into GBP},
year = {2005},
isbn = {0974903914},
publisher = {AUAI Press},
address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {GBP and EP are two successful algorithms for approximate probabilistic inference, which are based on different approximation strategies. An open problem in both algorithms has been how to choose an appropriate approximation structure. We introduce "structured region graphs," a formalism which marries these two strategies, reveals a deep connection between them, and suggests how to choose good approximation structures. In this formalism, each region has an internal structure which defines an exponential family, whose sufficient statistics must be matched by the parent region. Reduction operators on these structures allow conversion between EP and GBP free energies. Thus it is revealed that all EP approximations on discrete variables are special cases of GBP, and conversely that some well-known GBP approximations, such as overlapping squares, are special cases of EP. Furthermore, region graphs derived from EP have a number of good structural properties, including maxent-normality and overall counting number of one. The result is a convenient framework for producing high-quality approximations with a user-adjustable level of complexity.},

address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose a generalization of previous approaches in qualitative decision making. Our work is based on the binary possibilistic utility (PU), which is a possibilistic counterpart of Expected Utility (EU). We first provide a new axiomatization of PU and study its relation with the lexicographic aggregation of pessimistic and optimistic utilities. Then we explain the reasons of the coarseness of qualitative decision criteria. Finally, thanks to a redefinition of possibilistic lotteries and mixtures, we present the refined binary possibilistic utility, which is more discriminating than previously proposed criteria.},

abstract = {One of the proposed solutions to the equilibrium selection problem for agents learning in repeated games is obtained via the notion of stochastic stability. Learning algorithms are perturbed so that the Markov chain underlying the learning dynamics is necessarily irreducible and yields a unique stable distribution. The stochastically stable distribution is the limit of these stable distributions as the perturbation rate tends to zero. We present the first exact algorithm for computing the stochastically stable distribution of a Markov chain. We use our algorithm to predict the long-term dynamics of simple learning algorithms in sample repeated games.},

abstract = {We propose a multi-wing harmonium model for mining multimedia data that extends and improves on earlier models based on two-layer random fields, which capture bidirectional dependencies between hidden topic aspects and observed inputs. This model can be viewed as an undirected counterpart of the two-layer directed models such as LDA for similar tasks, but bears significant difference in inference/learning cost tradeoffs, latent topic representations, and topic mixing mechanisms. In particular, our model facilitates efficient inference and robust topic mixing, and potentially provides high flexibilities in modeling the latent topic spaces. A contrastive divergence and a variational algorithm are derived for learning. We specialized our model to a dual-wing harmonium for captioned images, incorporating a multivariate Poisson for word-counts and a multivariate Gaussian for color histogram. We present empirical results on the applications of this model to classification, retrieval and image annotation on news video collections, and we report an extensive comparison with various extant models.},

isbn = {0974903914},
publisher = {AUAI Press},
address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {We consider the estimation of the policy gradient in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) with a special class of structured policies that are finite-state controllers. We show that the gradient estimation can be done in the Actor-Critic framework, by making the critic compute a "value" function that does not depend on the states of POMDP. This function is the conditional mean of the true value function that depends on the states. We show that the critic can be implemented using temporal difference (TD) methods with linear function approximations, and the analytical results on TD and Actor-Critic can be transfered to this case. Although Actor-Critic algorithms have been used extensively in Markov decision processes (MDP), up to now they have not been proposed for POMDP as an alternative to the earlier proposal GPOMDP algorithm, an actor-only method. Furthermore, we show that the same idea applies to semi-Markov problems with a subset of finite-state controllers.},

year = {2005},
isbn = {0974903914},
publisher = {AUAI Press},
address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {One of the main problems of importance sampling in Bayesian networks is representation of the importance function, which should ideally be as close as possible to the posterior joint distribution. Typically, we represent an importance function as a factorization, i.e., product of conditional probability tables (CPTs). Given diagnostic evidence, we do not have explicit forms for the CPTs in the networks. We first derive the exact form for the CPTs of the optimal importance function. Since the calculation is hard, we usually only use their approximations. We review several popular approximation strategies and point out their limitations. Based on an analysis of the influence of evidence, we propose a method for approximating the exact form of importance function by explicitly modeling the most important additional dependence relations introduced by evidence. Our experimental results show that the new approximation strategy offers an immediate improvement in the quality of the importance function.},

publisher = {AUAI Press},
address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {Different directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) may be Markov equivalent in the sense that they entail the same conditional independence relations among the observed variables. Chickering (1995) provided a transformational characterization of Markov equivalence for DAGs (with no latent variables), which is useful in deriving properties shared by Markov equivalent DAGs, and, with certain generalization, is needed to prove the asymptotic correctness of a search procedure over Markov equivalence classes, known as the GES algorithm.For DAG models with latent variables, maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) provide a neat representation that facilitates model search. However, no transformational characterization — analogous to Chickering's — of Markov equivalent MAGs is yet available. This paper establishes such a characterization for directed MAGs, which we expect will have similar uses as it does for DAGs.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of diagnosing faults in a system represented by a Bayesian network, where diagnosis corresponds to recovering the most likely state of unobserved nodes given the outcomes of tests (observed nodes). Finding an optimal subset of tests in this setting is intractable in general. We show that it is difficult even to compute the next most-informative test using greedy test selection, as it involves several entropy terms whose exact computation is intractable. We propose an approximate approach that utilizes the loopy belief propagation infrastructure to simultaneously compute approximations of marginal and conditional entropies on multiple subsets of nodes. We apply our method to fault diagnosis in computer networks, and show the algorithm to be very effective on realistic Internet-like topologies. We also provide theoretical justification for the greedy test selection approach, along with some performance guarantees.},
