abstract = {Reading is part of how we understand the world, how we share knowledge, how we play, and even how we think. Although reading text is the dominant form of reading, most of the text we read letters, numbers, words, and sentences is surrounded by illustrations, photographs, and other kinds of symbols that we include as we read. As dynamic displays migrate into the real world at many scales, whether personal devices, handhelds, or large screens in both interior and exterior spaces, opportunities for reading migrate as well. As has happened continually throughout the history of reading, new technologies, physical forms and social patterns create new genres, which themselves may then combine or collide to morph into something new.At PARC, the RED (Research in Experimental Design) group examined emerging technologies for impact on media and the human relationship to information, especially reading. We explored new ways of experiencing text: new genres, new styles of interaction, and unusual media. Among the questions we considered: how might "the book" change? How does the experience of reading change with the introduction of new technologies, and how does authoring change?In this talk, we'll discuss the ideas behind the design and research process that led to creating eleven different experiences of new forms of reading for a museum exhibit called "XFR: eXperiments in the Future of Reading". We'll also consider how our technological context for reading has changed in recent years, and what influence the lessons from XFR may have on our ever-developing online reading experiences.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a measure that uses a spread co-citation relationship for document retrieval. To clarify whether this proposed measure has potential for enhancing the search performance of co-citation searching, two retrieval methods are evaluated: one uses the relationship directly; the other incorporates the co-citation context. Experiments with a special test collection comprising about 152,000 documents are conducted. Results indicate that this relationship tends to be able to detect relevant documents which are undetectable using a traditional co-citation relationship, and that using context has a positive effect to reduce the number of noise documents.},

abstract = {Learning to read efficiently and effectively is emphasized at the elementary and high school levels. Finding books that children/youth are interested in reading, however, is a non-trivial task due to the diversity of topics and different readability levels covered in the huge volume of books available these days. Ideally, K-12 students can turn to book recommenders which suggest books that match their interests. However, since the preferences and reading levels of these students vary from one grade to another, books suggested by existing recommenders, which ignore the literacy skills and the personal interests of their users, may be unsuitable for the targeted audience. In this paper, we present additional design issues that should be applied in developing a book recommender based on BReK12, our previously-proposed book recommender for K-12 users, to further enhance the quality of its recommendations. BReK12, which performs content and readability analysis to identify books potentially appealing to its users, is extended to incorporate (i) a multi-criteria analysis that studies its users' complex and diverse interests and (ii) an enhanced readability-detection tool that determines precisely the readability levels of books which match the literary skills of its users.},

abstract = {Reading is an important activity for individuals. Content-based recommendation systems are, typically, used to recommend scientific papers or news, where search is driven by topic. Literary reading or reading for leisure differs from scientific reading, because users search books not only for their topic but also by author or writing style. Choosing a new book to read can be tricky and recommendation systems can make it easy by selecting books that the user will like. In this paper we study recommendation through writing style and the influence of negative examples in user preferences. Our experiments were conducted in a hybrid set-up that combines a collaborative filtering algorithm with stylometric relevance feedback. Using the LitRec data set, we demonstrate that writing style influences book selection; that book content, characterized with writing style, can be used to improve collaborative filtering results; and that negative examples do not improve final predictions.},

With the power of modern computing technologies, we can gather, analyze, replicate, and transfer digital content at unprecedented speeds and scale. These advantages stimulate the digitization of physical books, manuscripts, and documents to make them an integral part of the digital repositories. However, transforming physical artifacts into digital formats places them in the same vulnerable position of the born digital content: there is no insurance that the content will be accessible in the future. We reflect on the unique nature of digital media and research needed to devise effective methods and techniques to facilitate long term access to digital content.},

abstract = {This paper argues that the best current text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems are approaching the quality necessary to provide effective automated narration of audio books. Currently, nearly all audio books and audio journals are recorded by professional voice actors at great expense with significant lead times. These cost and time constraints mean that fewer than than 2% of the new titles published each year are available in "Talking Book" editions, leaving the visually-impaired and print-disabled community of users with few options when seeking material in digital libraries. State-of-the-art TTS systems now can reproduce human voice prosody of sufficient quality to make listening to long narrative reading both pleasant and comprehensible. Such technology is relatively compact and inexpensive; it is time to deploy it widely as an alternative means of accessing digital texts. This would not only directly benefit the reading-disabled community, but also enable "digital natives" and other users to listen to texts on platforms on which reading may not be practical.},
