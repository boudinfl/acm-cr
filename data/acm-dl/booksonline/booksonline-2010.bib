abstract = {Despite the widespread use of Web 2.0 techniques in our entire surrounding environment, which tend to make it more social, more dynamic and driven by users, some domains have not really changed yet. This is the case for (e-)books which reading remains mainly a solitary activity - or which is done at least without appropriate collaborative tools. However, the benefits of making this activity - and especially active reading - more social and digital are huge - in particular for people having learning reading goals - leading potentially to a wide range of new services: faster access to information, possibility to interact with people sharing similar concerns or able to provide relevant explanations, determining most interesting areas in a book, or even helping users accessing faster the information that will make them progress in their learning curve. Thus, in this position paper, we describe a set of concepts and features about a "sBook", which consists in making e-books more social, more communicative, in order to sustain students in a learning activity, and leverage collective intelligence from social interactions to make students' learning experience more efficient.},

abstract = {As interactive digital documents are becoming more and more commonplace, we find ourselves searching for new ways to make good use of them. The fast delivery and large storage capacity that digital devices offer, make reading from bulky physical books seem obsolete, even nonsensical. EReaders, the latest craze in digital reading, follows from the introduction of eInk and promises paper-like reading capabilities with the added digital benefits.. But is the excitement justified? Can you `curl up' with an eReader in the same way as you can a physical book, or is the design of eReading devices hindering this process?.As of yet, no one has taken a scientific view of current eReader technology from the systematic standpoint of basic HCI principles. This paper discusses guidelines for good eReader design and illustrates them with examples of shortcomings of some of the more popular eReader devices on the market today.},

abstract = {This paper describes an effort to build a bookshelf of electronic books for children. This will then be made available for researchers to run user studies. Reading is a very personal experience and, when considering children 6-9 years old, even reading for pleasure is intertwined with learning and getting essential lifelong skills. As children in the Western world are increasingly interacting with technology from a very young age, it is often the case they are exposed and enjoy playing, browsing and searching the web, even before their reading and writing skills are fully developed. Besides, we have experienced in previous studies how extremely positive is children's attitude toward technology and this is worth exploiting when considering an essential and demanding skill such as reading. On this basis, we believe electronic books have lot of potential in engaging and getting children more enthusiastic about reading. Of course proper interfaces have to be designed to take into account young readers' specific needs. In order to involve children in the design process we need a collection of titles that children would want to read. Copyright free material has a role to play with classics that can be presented in appealing editions to children but it is also important to offer content children really want to read. We also need to consider the social side of reading at that young age and how children rely on each other suggestions. This is why we believe the bookshelf we aim to build in consultation with al relevant stake-holders: librarians, book sellers, parents, children and educators, will play a crucial role in getting us a real picture of how children interact and enjoy reading electronic books. In this paper, we will describe a cluster of interrelated projects, all aimed at offering children innovative and engaging e-books. None of these projects has started yet, but in here we will explore their mutual implications and related expectations. Building a bookshelf of children titles will provide us with a collections to be used during the co-design and testing of innovative interfaces for e-books as in project HEBE. It will ensure children taking part in the design process would engage with books they are willing to read for real. This will, in turn, enable us to study and build a social network for children to share and search book reviews made by their peers.},

This position paper will provide some history as to how the project began, its use within graduate level courses since 2009, and a follow up workshop held in March 2010, which culminated in funding being allocated to sending technological and human resources, which created more opportunities for the stakeholders to find out solutions together. Using the ODBS as a case study, we will share our experiences and relating them to three themes at this conference: sensitivity to social context, designing across cultural boundaries, and the integration of content and service.},

abstract = {When you digitalize a different version, or even when you create a book digitally, that implies choices of format, codification and standards which are going to definitely change our experience as readers. Whilst analyzing the Portuguese project 'Biblioteca de Livros Digitais'[2], I question how the use of new technologies has been translating aesthetic innovations into the every day most sensitive reading experience. I believe that important questions about reading comprehension on the digital realm need to be addressed if we want to effectively understand online reading today. In this paper, I will closely examine the skills and abilities needed to interact with e-books on BLD while exploring the answers to these three questions: Is the reading process different on BLD? If so, what new processes are used beyond those needed to comprehend conventional print? And if we are talking about another type of reading, what implications do these differences have for today's literacies? To explore the changing nature of reading, I draw upon the unifying concept of transliteracy created by Sue Thomas and the Production and Research in Transliteracy group (PART)[8]},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the importance of evaluation and in particular the impact of user studies on the progress and improvement of e-books and their usability, with particular attention to their design and functionalities aimed at increasing overall user experience. While there is a consensus on the importance of good design and few authors have already been publishing guidelines and provided advice on good practice, still no much attention has been paid to evaluation and its impact on e-book quality. It would indeed be extremely useful for designers to have a common platform in terms of bench-marks, agreed procedures, criteria and measures to evaluate the impact of their products on users but this is far from happening. The reality is that quite a few researchers are setting up evaluation experiments and collecting evidence of good practice but mostly in isolation from other previous or current similar initiatives. Under the INEX Book Track a specific task called Active Reading Task (ART) has been designed to gather efforts across the e-book community. Over the last two years we have tried to raise awareness in related communities but we are still facing serious problems in terms of participation. Indeed, we understand how demanding taking part in ART maybe, as working with users, real or surrogates, always has a high cost in terms of time and resources, this is why we are working to make the overall experience as rewarding, efficient and painless as possible. We strongly believe that such initiative would bring lots of benefits to the e-book community at large, in terms of improved design and quality of e-books. This paper starts with a description of ART, as part of the INEX initiative. We will then point out known problems with participation and discuss how to increase visibility, awareness and participation to ART by involving as many members of relevant communities as possible and by providing them with support and examples of good practice.},
