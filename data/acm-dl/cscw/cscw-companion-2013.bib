abstract = {ResearchBroker is an online system, which connects academic researchers with real-world research opportunities at companies, organizations and government institutions. A number of companies and organizations don't have the expertise or the resources to conduct research studies on their application software/systems. Similarly PhD students are looking for research work in industry that also aligns with their academic research interests. ResearchBroker has been developed to connect these two parties. In this demo, we first introduce ResearchBroker system along-with its current usage and then discuss a prototype for an interactive browsing experience on ResearchBroker.},

However, users rarely know whether, when, and by whom information was actually accessed within the parameters they specified. We define actual accesses to personal information as "information exposure". Knowing one's exposure can potentially enhance privacy management. Toward this end, we present Attire: an app for computers and smartphones that represents the user with an avatar.

abstract = {Broadcast media are declining in their power to decide which issues and viewpoints will reach large audiences. But new information filters are appearing, in the guise of recommender systems, aggregators, search engines, feed ranking algorithms, and the sites we bookmark and the people and organizations we choose to follow on Twitter. Sometimes we explicitly choose our filters; some we hardly even notice. Critics worry that, collectively, these filters will isolate people in information bubbles only partly of their own choosing, and that the inaccurate beliefs they form as a result may be difficult to correct. But should we really be worried, and, if so, what can we do about it? Our panelists will review what scholars know about selectivity of exposure preferences and actual exposure and what we in the CSCW field can do to develop and test ways of promoting diverse exposure, openness to the diversity we actually encounter, and deliberative discussion.},

abstract = {Green Dolphin (GD) is a question and answer system for students learning programming, with a social web interface. It crowd-sources the task of answering technical questions to the peers of students who ask questions. GD has several original features that make it different from existing systems. It automatically identifies students who are knowledgeable based on their activity, and tags them as experts to whom other students can ask questions. GD provides students with automatic feedback of the quality of code they submit. Thus, students get fast and high quality answers from their peers and the system, freeing up time for teachers. After a student posts a question in GD, it delays making visible answers from instructors and teaching assistants so that other students are encouraged to participate, and have time to answer the question. We believe that this can significantly increase student participation, collaboration and sense of ownership. Students gain new knowledge from the flow of questions and answers in the system. They develop communication skills by asking and answering questions as well as programming and debugging skills.},

The requirement of designing for embedded systems, which places a strict upper limit on available computing power, in addition to the restriction on haptic feedback, makes designing a suitable interface a unique challenge. The proposed solution relies on an ingenious extension of Voice Activity Detection providing inherent disturbance immunity, and incorporates feedback to the user to make selection of the input easier. This input scheme is being tested for a unique system for cleansing immobile patients via nozzle-fitted gloves worn by an operator on both hands. The design calls for the operator being able to control the flow of soap, water, or a stream of hot air from the nozzles, even with both hands engaged in cleaning the patient using the gloves.},

Technologies and systems have been developed to support such collaborations. However, existing systems often confine collaborators in fixed desktop settings. Yet, there are many situations in which collaborators are mobile and/or desktop settings are not possible to set up. In this paper, we present HandsInAir, a real-time collaborative wearable system for remote collaboration. HandsInAir is designed to support mobility of both the worker and the helper and to provide easy access to remote expertise. In particular, this system implements a novel approach that allows helpers to perform hand gestures in the air and frees two hands of workers for object operations. We describe the system and an evaluation of it and envision future work.},

The 90-9-1 rule states that 90% of users are "lurkers" who do not contribute, 9% are those who contribute from time to time, and only 1% of participants are highly active in the community and make most contributions. The question is: how can we motivate the inactive users to contribute? Previous research has shown that altruism is one of the most influential reasons for active contributors to participate [3, 10]. We present a new approach to promote altruism by capitalizing on reciprocity and gratitude in a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) system, in order to mitigate the participation inequality problem. In this paper, we introduce how gratitude and reciprocity can stimulate the intrinsic motivator, altruism, in our system EnishiSource. Also, we describe a user study with 8 participants and show our preliminary results.},

Although most of functional-service robots are lack expressive faces, research that supports social interaction between users and facial-constrained robots are limited. This study investigated what interaction modalities can be effectively used for naturalistic social interaction between users and facial-constrained robots in a domestic environment. We applied non-facial and non-verbal interaction methods for representing robots' state. We conducted a 3 (modalities: motion vs. light vs. sound) within-participants experiment (N=25). Using motion was the most familiar way of interaction between a user and a non-facial robot. Also, robots' perceived sociality was associated with people's preference for robots. This study shows evidence that robots' motion would be helpful for users to understand the robots' mind in a social manner; furthermore, it would enhance users' acceptance of robots.},

We conducted a discourse analysis examining the practices of active roleplayers, who interact with thousands of other fans and fellow players to continue their experience of the story, and engage in what we term Twitter play. Our findings illustrate how roleplayers are able to use Twitter to expand their experience of media and story. By examining roleplayers' use of Twitter affordances, we find that these performers not only exhibit deep knowledge of their characters and the narrative, but also of Twitter, demonstrated by expanding the uses of the service's affordances to playfully connect the story with popular culture and current events.},

abstract = {Virtual worlds are well-known as being fantasy spaces sealed off from the real world, but more careful analysis reveals that the boundaries between the real and the virtual are quite porous. Participants or such experiences carry with them their unique set of subjective behavioral assumptions and attitudes that cannot be disentangled from their interactions in the virtual world and vice versa.Like the real world; these modeled worlds simulate appearances very similar to the real one or a hybrid fantasy; which also dictates the rules and conduct accordingly in the simulated world and potentially in the real world, depending on the immersive-ness of the experience.From a psychoanalytic viewpoint; these simulations of hybrid fantasies, aspirations or desires originate from within one's own self i.e. the 'unconscious' - a suppressed part of our being which finds itself in control and many a times pampered in these environments, transcending socio-economic, cultural, physical or psychological barriers.Be it engaging web portals, virtual environments, online multiplayer gaming or a simple Avatar on a common chat client; the depiction of this world is very similar to the real one, involving real-time actions, and communication, where the degree of immediacy may vary according to its usage, intent and design.},

It allows anyone with a personal electronic device and regardless of their musical expertise to participate in the music an orchestra generates, while also encouraging social interactions among participants. Users can be either musicians or conductors. The latter drive the group's music production, while the others follow simple game-like instructions on their device for playing the conductor's selected songs. The primary mode of interaction for playing songs, consists of rotating one's electronic device in different ways. Our system also provides different social interaction cues that aim for novice and expert users to start conversations with each other and improve the group's performance as well as construct a community among participants. We report on a qualitative analysis, which suggests that users appreciate the system's versatility in providing service to a variety of devices and enjoy participating in the orchestra with their own personal device. Users judged the social interaction cues the system provided to be effective. We believe our findings aid the design of future social intelligent environments that seek to build communities with participants through music.},

abstract = {Although various partner-matching services are available on the Internet, finding a partner is still difficult because reading the various attributes and self-advertisements of potential marriage partners is not enough to find a lifetime partner. We have developed an SNS-based marriage partner-finding system, "Ding-Dong," which makes full use of support from participants' friends. Using Ding-Dong, the partner seeker can understand what the partner candidate is really like by seeing the candidates' everyday behavior, reading the "reviews" written by their friends, and watching the conversations between the candidates and their friends.},

abstract = {Ever wondered if it was a good time to call your spouse, child, or friend? Do you sometimes just want to know if they are on their way to meet you? With Peek you can request the activity state (e.g. walking, in-vehicle, at-rest) and location of a phone when needed. Context is sent back automatically to people on the phone owner's pre-approved Peek contact list. The person being peeked at receives a notification that provides awareness of who peeked at them and when.},

abstract = {Collaborative editing (CE) has been an area of continuous research since early days of CSCW. Various CE systems have been studied in academia as research vehicles to investigate key technical issues in building advanced collaborative applications. In recent years, CE techniques have been increasingly adopted and further developed in industry for supporting real-world Internet or Cloud-based CE systems/services, such as Google Docs, Codoxware, IBM OpenCoWeb, Novell Vibe, and SubEthaEdit. This workshop aims to bring together CE academic researchers, industry developers, and end-users to discuss and exchange ideas on contemporary issues in researching, developing, and adopting CE systems. We have successfully organized this workshop annually at CSCW-related conferences. This year's workshop focuses on CE issues and techniques for supporting complex real-world documents (including but not limited to rich text, xml, spreadsheet, 2D/3D digital media, CAD, video, etc.), and evaluation of CE systems for such complex real-world documents.},

abstract = {Despite an increasing use of formal healthcare systems such as the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and communication devices, informal communication continues to play an important role in the highly collaborative, dynamic, and information-rich medical work. Formal systems often fail to support the spontaneous and opportunistic needs of healthcare providers to communicate patient information. Yet it is not clear what constitutes informal communication in healthcare practices, what roles does it play in the patient care process, what types of technologies can be designed to support informal communication, and how to design them. This workshop aims to gather interested researchers to better understand informal communication in healthcare, to discuss their implications for CSCW healthcare research, and to brainstorm technological innovations that can support the informal aspects of health communication.},

This workshop is an effort to gather a small and motivated set of such participants. The workshop will incorporate discussions on theoretical foundations of CIS as well as its applications. It will bring together researchers from both academia and industry, working in the fields of CSCW, CSCL, IR, HCI, and PIM to share their ideas, questions, and opinions on how theories and practices from different domains can be brought together to create a strong and rich path ahead for collaborative information seeking/retrieval/searching as well as collective information synthesis and sense-making.},

abstract = {Collaboration in safety-critical environment introduces special challenges for the tools in use, as the tools need to reliably support work tasks conducted in challenging and verifying situations. Examples of these types of environments include industrial settings (i.e. oil and gas platforms, mines, and factories), transportation (i.e. ships, airplanes, and trains), military settings, and hospitals. People collaborating and communicating with each other in safety-critical environments might be co-located or interacting remotely, and the interaction can be simultaneous or asynchronous. Furthermore, the information communicated need to be accurate and timely. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from various backgrounds to discuss challenges and opportunities designing IT tools for collaboration in safety-critical environments. Such tools could bring significant improvements to personnel safety as well as efficiency when carefully designed. We also invite studies describing safety-critical environments and their needs for collaboration tools. Such information is traditionally challenging to gather because these types of environments are physically dangerous and/or difficult to access.},
