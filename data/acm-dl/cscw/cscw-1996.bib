abstract = {This full-day workshop is intended for designers, researchers, and decision-makers to discuss and compare their experiences with designing and introducing groupware in an organizational context.  Considering the impact that groupware has had on collaboration in recent years, there are relatively few published studies on experiences with introducing groupware.  With so few comparisons, it is difficult to develop and appropriate framework which could guide its introduction.  Yet it is important not only to understand successes and failiures with methods, but also design and methodology compromises that groupware implementers must live with.Workshop participants shall present and discuss their experinces with requirement anlalysis, design and realization, training, user  support/mediation, roles in the design team, and user acceptance.  One goal of the workshop is to identify commonalities between different methods associated with successes and problems in order to move in the direction of developing approaches that will benefit users in system adaptation.  An important issue here will be to view the introduction of groupware as an integrated organizational and technological development, i.e., a design of technology, work, and organizations.},

abstract = {ARGUS is a prototype system which achieves awareness before starting face-to-face communication by utilizing multiple far-end controllable cameras on a broadband network. A user desiring awareness information can change camera directions and angular fields of view at will in order to get the desired image. We call this active control of cameras to aquire awareness information “active awareness.” Camera locations and viewing fields can be quickly grasped by camera icons on the Map Viewer, which shows the actual office layout. ARGUS has a merit to provide both wide area views and close, detailed views via the control of remote cameras. However, the privacy of people may be violated, for example, through extreme magnificaiton. Therefore, it is very important to carefully consider the camera placement and usage. We have modeled office enviroments and have introduced two camera types: private cameras and public cameras. The aim of the former type is to catch a personal view whereas the aim of the latter type is to monitor common spaces. To protect privacy, ARGUS has several levels of access restrictions for each of these camera types. In this video, we describe the policy and implementation of ARGUS from the viewpoints of user interface and privacy.},

People in InterSpace communicate using audio as well as video interaction in a three dimensional world. Remote terimals are connected to a central server via networks. Facial image, audio, and proximity, are processed and sent out to the remote terminals to enable multi-modal communication in a virtual world. InterSpace technology comes a step closer to bridging the gap between virtual reality and world experiences. We conducted a trial service, CyberCampus, based on the InterSpace platform. Individual actions can now be shared with other users as you explore, talk, shop, learn, and experience the many facets of CyberCampus. Environments related to entertainment,  distance learning, on-line shopping, and advertisement are currently being explored in CyberCampus with unlimited expansion capabilities.CyberCampus debuted in September 1995 and has been hosted by several universities and businesses in the San Francisco area. Preliminary usage suggests that multi-user, multi-modal interaction has a prominent role in the future of telecommunications.},

abstract = {Real-time groupware systems often let each participant control their own view into a shared workspace. However, when collaborators do not share the same view they lose their awareness about where and how others are interacting with the workspace artifacts. We have designed a number of add-on awareness windows that help people regain this awareness. Two general strategies and several variations are illustrated in this video that extend work done in a few other groupware systems. First, radar overviews shrink the entire workspace to fit within a single window. Awareness is indicated by overlaying the overview with boxes representing others' viewports, by telepointers that show where they are working, and by seeing changes to objects in the workspace as they are made. The workspace can  be represented within the radar overview as a scaled miniature, by stylized objects, or by its semantic structure. Second, two types of detailed views show some or all of what another person can see, providing awareness of fine-grained details of others' actions.},

abstract = {Real time groupware systems are now moving away from strict view-sharing and towards relaxed “what-you-see-is-what-I-see” interfaces, where distributed participants in a real time session can view different parts of a shared visual workspace. As with strict view-sharing, people using relaxed-WYSIWIS require a sense of workspace awareness—the up-to-the-minute knowledge aobut another person's interactions with the shared workspace. The problem is deciding how to provide a user with an appropriate level of awareness of what other participants are doing when they are working in different areas of the workspace. In this video, we illustrate distortion oriented displays as a novel way of providing this awareness. These displays, which employ magnification lenses and fisheye view techniques, show global context and local detail within a  single window, both peripheral and detailed awareness of other participants' actions. Three prototypes are presented as examples of groupware distortion-oriented displays. The head-up lens uses a see-through lens to show full-sized local detail in the foreground, and a miniature overview showing global context in the background. The offset lens employs a magnifying lens to show detail over a miniature overview. The fisheye text viewer provides people with detail of what everyone is doing through multiple focal points, one for each participant.},

abstract = {Prairie is a simulation prototype or vision, demonstrating how individuals may work together in a virtual work enviroment designed for a whole enterprise. Prairie addresses various organizational and social issues exacerbated by distance and time. By using the concept of communities and by extending physical interaction cues to others across distance and time, we demonstrate possible solutions to these issues. In Prairie, people and information are organized into mission-based (organizational units), goal-based (project teams) and interest-based (special interest groups) hierarchies for ease of navigation. A worker may alternately navigate to communities by using personal links from their private virtual desktops. Each community has two areas. One area contains the information germane  to a community, that is pushed or pulled depending on the nature of the information. Each community also has an area with a shared view where community members can meet or congregate. Presence in these community areas range from seeing thumbnail photos to holding a video-conference. The shared view facilitates ad hoc, informal interactions which are important for maintaining and building social networks and organizational culture. We believe the framework for Prairie is flexible, integrated, and scaleable so it can be adapted to model other organizations, communities, and processes.},

abstract = {This video shows a multiparty videoconferencing system “MAJIC” and a multiparty desktop conferencing system “DesktopMAJIC”. MAJIC is composed of 2 video cameras, 2 video projectors, a one-way transparent screen, and a tilted workstation forming a desk. Life-size video images of participants are projected without boundaries onto a large curved screen as if users in remote locations are sitting around a table attending a meeting together. MAJIC supports gaze awareness and multiple eye-contact among the participants. Moreover, a shared work space is provided at the center, enabling users to carry on a discussion in a manner comparable to face-to-face meetings. Although MAJIC is very effective, it needs a high speed network and special facilities. DesktopMAJIC is  implemented on a convential computer workstation, and supports pseudo gaze awareness and pseudo hand action. Still-picture portraits of the user in 9 different gaze directions are sent to every DesktopMAJIC in advance, and an appropriate one is dynamically selected during the conference to reflect where the user is paying attention. Moreover, other participants' mouse cursors on the shared application window are linked to their portrait window, allowing each user to intuitively see which cursor belongs to whom. Since DesktopMAJIC does not need a high speed network, it may work smoothly even in a telephone or wireless network environment.},

The GestureCam consists of an actuator with three degrees of freedom and a video camera mounted on the actuator. The actuators can be controlled by a master-slave method, by a touch-sensitive CRT, or by a gyro sensor. Also, a laser pointer is mounted on an actuator to assist remote pointing. The experiments  with human subjects are also shown in the video.},

These systems incorporate diagnostic aids, on-line maintenance manuals, schematic drawings, and telecommunications that allow workers to access both stored information and interactive help from remote experts.  This videotape illustrates the problem area and some wearable computer prototypes.  It describes some of the field work we have done documenting the value of collaboration when workers are diagnosing and repairing complex equipment.  Our laboratory experiments investigate whether wireless video capabilities are useful.  One  prototype incorporates both shared computer-based information (an on-line repair manual) and a shared view of the non-computerized work space (a video feed from a head-mounted camera).  Experiments so far show that commumication with a remote expert improves the speed and quality of repairs, but that shared video does not.  Video does, however, affect how collaborators coordinate their behavior, for example by allowing a pair to be less verbally explicit.  The videotape illustrates how a collaborative pair can exploit both shared data sources to communicate more effectively.},

abstract = {This video demonstrates different aspects of the DOLPHIN cooperative hypermedia environment in the context of electroic meeting rooms.  There are three parts.  First, the basic funtionality of DOLPHIN for electronic whiteboards is demonstrated.  This includes the pen-based user-interface for creating informal structures such as scribbling, freehand sketching, and the creation of nodes and links.  Interaction for frequently used operations is based on gesture-recognition.  Second, it shows how DOLPHIN supports different aspects of meetings including the processes in the pre-, in-, and post-meeting phases.  During the meeting, participants can use computers mounted in the meeting room table.  Thus, everybody can access and modify information on the public space displayed on the  whiteboard while sitting at the table.  They can also engage in parallel private work which can be shared with the group later on.  The third part demonstrates how DOLPHIN can be used to support meetings between two groups on physically distributed meeting rooms.  Shared workspaces are complemented by audio/video connections between the rooms.  It is noted that DOLPHIN can also be used in distributed desktop-based situations.},
