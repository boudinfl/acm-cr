abstract = {SEeS@w faces the problem of safety in working environments in an innovative way, putting together objects and people, and the virtual and real word. We aimed at designing and developing a demonstrative prototype of an innovative ICT solution to monitor, evaluate and manage risks in a complex cooperative working environment. Data about risks are provided by workers themselves using interactive maps, according to the Internet of Persons paradigm. Maps are also fed by other data collected by networks of ambient and wearable sensors connected to the Internet, according to the Internet of Things paradigm. Maps display and bring all these data together, and can be therefore used by workers as a powerful instrument to coordinate people, manage risk issues, and improve safety at work. Thanks to the Living Lab methodology, we brought together the technical and human aspects of the project, testing the solution in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, usability and ergonomics.},

abstract = {Online crowds are a promising source of new innovations. However, crowd innovation quality does not always match its quantity. One way to improve quality is to enable experts to provide personalized feedback. However, this scales poorly, and may lead to premature convergence during creative work. To deal with these issues, we present IdeaGens, a crowd ideation system that adapts expert facilitation, a successful strategy for improving collaborative creativity in face-to-face brainstorms, to crowd brainstorming. In IdeaGens, experts monitor incoming ideas from the crowd through a dashboard, and offer high-level "inspirations" to guide ideation towards interesting solution themes. In a randomized controlled experiment, crowd workers who receive facilitation through IdeaGens generate significantly more creative ideas that unfacilitated crowd workers.},

abstract = {While large-scale automatic grading of student programs for correctness is widespread, less effort has focused on au-tomating feedback for good programming style: the tasteful use of language features and idioms to produce code that is not only correct, but also concise, elegant, and revealing of design intent. We hypothesize that with a large enough (MOOC-sized) corpus of submissions to a given program-ming problem, we can observe a range of stylistic mastery from naive to expert, and many points in between, and that we can exploit this continuum to automatically provide hints to learners to improve their code style based on the key stylistic differences between a given learner's submission and one that is stylistically slightly better. We present a sys-tem with two key interfaces. The first is an instructor-facing GUI that allows an instructor to browse student submis-sions clustered by stylistic patterns and view chains from a particular submission to a canonical one. The second is a student-facing GUI that allows a student to submit a solu-tion and receive instantaneous style feedback.},

Many enterprises use virtual agents that automatically interact with customers across a variety of interaction channels. However, these agents have no emotional intelligence and cannot express themselves in an empathic manner. This demo demonstrates the use of emotional intelligence in a technical conversation with a customer. The agent is augmented with emotion sensing capabilities, which allow him to detect expressed emotions, and reply in an appropriate manner by expressing empathy, for example.},

We aim to address these problems by leveraging the large expert user base such programs tend to have. We present DiscoverySpace, a prototype extension panel for Adobe Photoshop that suggests macros for effects to apply to the user's photo, based on features of the photo. These macros are Photoshop actions that have been created and shared online by the user community, and can be applied in one click. Our work demonstrates how high-level macro suggestions can help users get started in a complex application. Preliminary feedback from a pilot study indicates that these suggestions may be most useful for users with exploratory goals, such as “make this photo more fun,” rather than users with very specific goals.},

Understanding large-scale variation in student solutions is a hard but important problem. For teachers, this variation can be a source of pedagogically valuable examples and expose corner cases not yet covered by autograding. For students, the variation in a large class means that other students may have struggled along a similar solution path, hit the same bugs, and can offer hints based on that earned expertise. We developed three systems to take advantage of the solu-tion variation in large classes, using program analysis and learnersourcing. All three systems have been evaluated using data or live deployments in on-campus or edX courses with thousands of students.},

In this paper we present CATS, an open source, scalable, Web application designed to support researchers who want to carry out studies based on tweets. The purpose of CATS is twofold: (i) allow people to collect tweets (ii) enable them to analyze these tweets thanks to efficient tools (e.g. event detection, named-entity recognition, topic modeling, word-clouds). What is more, CATS relies on a distributed imple-mentation which can deal with massive data streams.},

Moreover, non-native speakers are supposed to pardon for one more listening but it is hard to get the opportunity when their partners keep on talking.

abstract = {Professionals and researchers of the Architectural, Engi-neering &amp; Construction (AEC) industry are challenged by the increasing complexity of designing, constructing and op-erating a building. This typically requires close cooperation of actors having different backgrounds and interests. Tra-ditionally, this cooperation happens in an ad-hoc way and information exchange occurs through conventional general-purpose communication channels, such as paper or email. This communication and collaboration process can be inad-equate and inefficient, as it makes room for many different interpretations, mistakes and errors and can eventually lead to schedule and cost alterations. We present Green2.0, a system that tries to leverage advancements in building in-formation modeling to facilitate the collaboration process. The system integrates energy-efficiency simulation tools, and methods for online social network analysis to enable a data-driven approach to building design, construction and operation. By sharing all information online, all project ac-tors can access relevant information when they need so that everyone can work efficient together. The system aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals work together throughout a building's lifecycle.},

abstract = {Structuring and rearranging free-hand sketches on large interactive surfaces typically requires making multiple stroke selections. Without well-designed selection tools, this can be both time-consuming and fatiguing. Investigating the concept of automated clustering, we conducted a background study to understand the varying perspectives of how elements in sketches can be grouped. In response to these diverse user expectations, we present cLuster, a flexible, domain-independent clustering approach for free-hand sketches. Our approach is designed to accept an initial user selection, which is then used to calculate a linear combination of pre-trained perspectives in real-time. The remaining elements are then clustered. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in a variety of application scenarios.},

A high-level approach to address this challenge is to create a synthesis of emerging solution space that can be used to provide participants with creative and diverse inspirational ideas of others. Existing approaches to generate the synthesis of solution space either require community members to engage in tasks that detract from the main activity of generating ideas or depend on external crowd workers to help organize the ideas. We built IDEAHOUND a collaborative idea generation system that demonstrates an alternative “organic” human computation approach, where community members (rather than external crowds) contribute feedback about ideas as a byproduct of an activity that naturally integrates into the ideation process. This feedback in turn helps the community identify diverse inspirational ideas that can prompt community members to generate more high-quality and diverse ideas.},

abstract = {Social science researchers spend significant time annotating behavioral events in video data in order to quantitatively assess interactions [2]. These behavioral events may be instantaneous changes, continuous actions that span unbounded periods of time, or behaviors that would be best described by severity or other scalar ratings. The complexity of these judgments, coupled with the time and effort required to meticulously assess video, results in a training and evaluation process that can take days or weeks. Computational analysis of video data is still limited due to the challenges introduced by objective interpretation and varied contexts. Glance [4] introduced a means of leveraging human intelligence by recruiting crowds of paid online workers to accurately analyze hours of video data in a matter of minutes. This approach has been shown to expedite work in human-centered fields, as well as generate training data for automated recognition systems. In this paper, we describe an interactive demonstration of an improved, more expressive version of Glance that expands the initial set of supported annotation formats (e.g. time range, classification, etc.) from one to nine. Worker interfaces for each of these options are dynamically generated, along with tutorials, based on the analyst's question. These new features allow analysts to acquire more specific information about events in video datasets.},

abstract = {Full participation in online social spaces requires the contri-bution of content in the form of text, activity, or multimedia. Decisions about whether to share a particular item and with whom can easily become complex, as users consider the potential risks or benefits of reaching various parts of their audience. As systems begin to support the sharing of large collections such as bulk-uploaded photos, these difficulties compound, and users often respond by adopting simple, sub-optimal sharing strategies. My proposed dissertation aims to model sharing decisions in order to inform systems which support nuanced decision-making at large scale.},

abstract = {Personalization has recently become an influential part of social media, as it significantly affects the ways people interact with each other through the systems. As more and more social media providers automatically personalize their services based on user data, of which process is often black-boxed, it hinders user's autonomy in their use of systems. In this context, this dissertation investigates the ways to design for user autonomy in a system-driven personalization of social media. Through three-phase studies, this dissertation aims to provide a solid set of design principles that researchers of future “smart” social systems can leverage in their practices.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of social media like Twitter and Facebook has lead to a paradigm shift in the way our so-ciety is producing and consuming information, from the broadcast mass media to online social media. To study the effects of this paradigm shift, we define the concept of infor-mation diet - which is the composition of a set of informa-tion items being produced or consumed. Information diets can be constructed along many aspects like topics (eg. pol-itics, sports, science etc), or perspectives (eg. politically left leaning or right leaning), or sources (eg. originating from different parts of the world). We use information diets to measure the diversity and bias in the information produced or consumed, and to study how the recommendation and search systems are shaping the diets of social media users. We leverage the insights we gain from analysing social me-dia users' diets to design better information discovery and exchange systems over social media.},

In this panel, we explore the tensions that arise around controlling personal information online. We do so through a series of case studies around lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) identities, children, personal data exchange, and advertising. In each, we consider the politics of visibility around personal, family, social, and community identities, especially in the context of marginalized or scrutinized populations and experiences. We aim to generate debate about appropriate sharing behaviors online and to further an agenda that prioritizes greater control of personal information online.},

Using crowd work models within enterprises requires addressing enterprise-specific concerns such as how to maintain focus on employees' primary work while providing the right incentives to perform crowd work, how to promote wide employee participation while preserving management oversight and control. We present a novel crowd work system for the enterprise, the Market for Enterprise Tasks (MET), that addresses these concerns via two novel features: an incentive system tied to real-world dollars and multiple means of indirect control offered to the management, especially the ability to limit the size of tasks performed in the market. We have deployed MET in several groups within a large IT enterprise and report on initial experiences.},

abstract = {As environmental groups utilize social media to increase the participation of citizens in contributing scientific data, the question of what kind of content will motivate user engagement becomes increasingly important. Using a Social Network Analysis framework and following on the heels of motivational studies, we examine the Facebook Fan Pages of three environmental communities: eBird, Aspen Center for Environmental Studies and the Anacostia Watershed Society. We find that whether posts originate with the page owner (Page Posts), with users (User Posts), or whether they are posted by Fan Pages of other sites (Mention Posts), posts on a site fall into 4 main categories based on their message and intent: informational, invitational, motivational and investigational. While thematic content analysis corroborates that posts by owners motivate the most user engagement across the board, the degree to which Page Posts cumulatively fall into the motivational category on a site critically impacts user engagement.},

abstract = {In this research, a mobile time management application was developed and tested on 5 Chinese and 5 French students of a university in China through some basic manipulations of the prototype and a personal interview in order to gain insights on cultural differences between French and Chinese time management practices. It was shown that the interviewees were late depending on the events' priority, but the priorit is different for Chinese and French students. Chinese students tend to change meeting times more frequently; therefore they often double-check meetings for confirmation. Design guidelines for time management applications can be deducted from these observations.},

This work investigates how social incentives work for individuals with obesity and diabetes. We used a mobile fitness application called HealthyTogether as an experimental platform, which allows dyads to achieve fitness goals together and compete in an online community. We conducted a four-week study with 16 obese and diabetic patients who used HealthyTogether to exercise with a buddy. Results show that participants exercised more with social incentives compared with their baseline. Collaborating with buddies to compete in a community was reported as motivating for dyads exercising with strong ties. Social interactions could be demotivating between dyads who did not know each other well. Finally, it is crucial to consider patients' technical literacy when designing behavior-changing technologies.},

abstract = {The cold start problem in recommender systems refers to the inability of making reliable recommendations if a critical mass of items has not yet been rated. To bypass this problem existing research focused on developing more reliable prediction models for situations in which only few items ratings exist. However, most of these approaches depend on adjusting the algorithm that determines a recommendation. We present a complimentary approach that does not require any adjustments to the recommendation algorithm. We draw on motivation theory and reward users for rating items. In particular, we instantiate different gamification patterns and examine their effect on the average user's number of provided report ratings. Our results confirm the positive effect of instantiating gamification patterns on the number of received report ratings.},

For the purpose of testing and validating our scale, we are relying on Mechanical Turk, an Amazon Web Service, through which we can enlist and pay workers to code our dataset of tweets. Preliminary results suggest that aggression in tweets is difficult for human coders to identify and that we have not reached consensus about what constitutes harassment online. We discuss our preliminary results and propose next steps such as scale modification and automated classifier development.},

abstract = {Tagging (or bookmarking) online resources with representative keywords is one of the most popular and practical approaches for giving identity to the objects. Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD. CODer Entrepreneurs in the automatically formed communities can dynamically improve identity of the entrepreneurial objects related to their expertise or interests.},

abstract = {The use of telepresence robots brings the impression of physical presence to remote collaborations, which is beneficial in terms of establishing a closer relationship in a short time. However, operating a robot requires substantial cognitive effort. This can cause problems in practical situations involving older users, where the cognitive load interferes with the main task that needs to be performed. We have developed a telepresence robot system that addresses this problem by lowering the barriers preventing the operation of a robot. Its basis is the concept of an “observation window” that allows the robot to be operated without using hands or having to wear additional devices. This lightweight, less intrusive technology is expected to be desirable even for older users. This poster describes the mechanism and implementation of our system and reports its effectiveness in practical use by people of all ages, including older users.},

abstract = {Expertise of an individual is metaphorically defined by shapes of letters such as I, T, M and hyphen, depending on her expertise in an area (depth) and the number of areas of interest (width). Industries have now started recruiting people with specific shapes of expertise. In this poster, we introduce the idea of mining shapes of user expertise in a typical online social Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) community where expert users often answer questions posed by other users. We report observations on distribution of different shapes of expertise in a StackExchange community called Super User.},

abstract = {Many online communities for high school computer science teachers have been developed to help teachers connect with each other and share course materials. However, these sites have failed to meet teachers' needs and are widely underused. Creating new communities by repeat-ing the design of existing sites will only require teachers to search additional sites to find what they need. Prior work has framed the inefficacy of these sites in terms of usabil-ity without exploring additional underlying problems that discourage teachers from using the sites. We interviewed teachers about their attitudes toward existing sites to further our understanding of these underlying problems. During interviews teachers said that finding relevant resources is difficult and contributing to these communities requires too much time. We propose a new design for a system that low-ers the barrier to participation while providing teachers with improved access to each other's relevant course materials.},

abstract = {In this project, we evaluate two different methods for highlighting shared gaze across two tasks with different collaborative properties. There are many factors to consider when designing shared gaze representations such as how much information to display and when to provide it so that it will be most useful. Unlike other non-verbal forms of communication such as deictic gesturing, gaze is not always intentionally communica-tive and therefore we need to think critically about when and how to display it. For each task, participants saw their partner's gaze displayed continuously, em-phasized either by previous fixation points or extended fixations. We discuss our findings and present design implications for shared gaze awareness based on inter-action traces and interviews with participants.},

We have found that Slack and its integrations (i.e., bots) are playing an increas-ingly significant role in software development, replacing email in some cases and disrupting software development processes. To understand how Slack impacts development team dynamics, we designed an exploratory study to inves-tigate how developers use Slack and how they benefit from it. We find that developers use Slack for personal, team-wide and community-wide purposes. Our research also reveals that developers use and create diverse integrations (called bots) to support their work. This study serves as the first step towards understanding the role of Slack in sup-porting software engineering.},

Even though recent developments in technology allowed for smart materials to become feasible and viable in a variety of contexts, they are not commonly seen in everyday computing devices. Different fields of knowledge such as Design and Engineering can benefit from harnessing the power of smart materials by proposing new forms of interaction within the space that smart materials unfold. We believe that by drawing inspiration from the theoretical framework of Computational Composite, a notion of Sensorial Interaction can be established, and provide practitioners with the tools necessary to bring this new field to a wider range of solutions. The purpose of this study is to establish, initially, a cross-domain conversation and to highlight the research opportunities revealed by introducing new channels of expression to an artifact.},

In the proposed game, each player is paired with another at random and, instead of an image, the paired players are provided with a purchase scenario. The scenario describes a scene where an individual chooses a product from a given product set from two different suppliers. The players are supposed to enter verbal expressions that explain the reason for the individual's choice, and when an expression entered by a player is judged to match one of the expressions entered by the other player, both of the players are given points based on the quality of the expression. The expressions gathered by the game are then used to draw a perceptual map of the set of products. Furthermore, when a designer wants to locate a new product on the perceptual map, the proposed game can be used to characterize the unknown new product “X.”},

We present two prototypes, one using linear slide potentiometers and the other using linear actuators, that incorporate these forms of feedback to facilitate mediated social touch. We present the benefits and drawbacks of each system, and conclude that, for a system focused on collaboration and synchronous communication, linear actuators may be better suited due to their load capacity and precision.},

For instance, the following parameters need to be decided when designing a peer-feedback system where students review each others' essays: the number of students each student must provide feedback to, an algorithm to map feedback providers to receivers, constraints that ensure students do not become free-riders (receiving feedback but not providing it), the best times to receive feedback to improve learning etc. While instructors can answer these questions by running experiments or invoking past experience, game-theoretic models with data from online learning platforms can identify better initial designs for further improvements. As an example, we explore the design space of a peer feedback system by modeling it using game theory. Our simulations show that incentivizing students to provide feedback requires the value obtained from receiving a feedback to exceed the cost of providing it by a large factor (greater than 7). Furthermore, hiding feedback from low-effort students incentivizes them to provide more feedback.},

We examined photographs taken by casual visitors to a Colorado nature preserve to look for clues about what attracts them. A thematic analysis revealed that the majority of their pictures were of plants, birds, and landscapes, and three-quarters chose to annotate some photos with comments or questions. Based on these findings, we propose ways to entice such visitors toward participating in biodiversity-oriented citizen science projects.},

This dyadic approach fails to adequate capture the array of group relationships that are more than the sum of their parts and prevalent in real-world situations. For example, collaborative teams, wireless broadcast, and political coalitions all contain unique group dynamics that need to be captured. In this paper, we use simplicial complexes to model these supra-dyadic relationships in networks. We argue that a number of problems within social and communications networks such as network-wide broadcast and collaborative teams can be elegantly captured using simplicial complexes in a way that is not possible with graphs. In this study, we operationalize several types of simplicial complexes in an online-based experiment using the Wildcat Wells paradigm. We then run subjects in these experiments to investigate measures of team strength and hub behavior using simplicial complex models.},

This work begins to close the gap in the literature by presenting a method to examine the interactions between a crowdfunding campaign video and a potential supporter in terms of emotion. We present a methodology based on a technique first developed in the study of emotions and videos that utilizes the idea of collective indexing. Our results show that it is likely that the emotional footprints of each video can be measured using our methodology.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new framework for video surveillance systems for crime prevention. The main purpose of this framework is to help provide reasonable and stable solutions for automated video surveillance systems in a collaborative way. This framework is characterized by a verification process using crowdsourcing after the image analysis process: automated image analyzer detects as many suspicious events as possible followed by filtering process using human intelligence, to achieve both high re-call and high precision rates. Here we describe the basic mechanisms for collaboration between camera devices, data stores, image analyzers and surveillance crowds.},

abstract = {Most mixed and augmented reality (MAR) applications require the target to be specified a priori and need the same MAR applications among cooperative users. Thus, most existing MAR applications are hard to share MAR scenes or contents without prior agreement for cooperative works. To address this problem, we propose a webizing method that redesigns component relationship of MAR content using an episode as a container of user interactions for sharing life experience and activities. The MAR scene can be gradually developed by multiple participants of the episode. Our examples demonstrate MAR contents can be cooperatively produced, accumulated and consumed like Web 2.0, a digital prosumption that has proven effective in dramatic expansion of Web contents.},

However, analyzing more than 350K videos on YouTube, we find that more than 10% of them obtain their peak popularity after at least one year from being uploaded. We term such videos as Sleeping Beauties and observe that these videos engage users more compared to other videos on YouTube. We further observe that sleeping beauties can retain their popularity to a greater extent following their peak popularity compared to other videos. We believe that recognizing such videos will not only benefit the advertisers, but also the designers of recommendation systems who seek to maximize user satisfaction. Through this interactive poster, we bring the presence and characteristics of sleeping beauties in front of the research community.},

We would not start them if there is no deadline, or if there is, we would be haunted by it. We have many tasks requested by a company, customer, family...etc., and those we want to do for ourselves. However, our time is limited and some tasks are left undone as a result. Lasting regrets result from the things we fail to do, not those we do. Moreover, tasks needing cooperation are tricky. We have to organize schedule, considering people concerned. If you are an important person, you can hire a secretary, but most of us can't. We propose the Human Process Design (HPD) service that is, so to speak, a task scheduler for humans. It makes a schedule and recommends a next task, and helps him/her complete tasks. We discuss the concept and the fundamental architecture of HPD and confirm its effectiveness thorough prototyping.},

abstract = {Online bots are quickly becoming important collaborators with humans in tackling issues in healthcare, politics, and even activism. Recently, non-profits have used many bots in place of their human members to scaffold collaborations with citizens. However, this shift invites new challenges: it is difficult for outsiders to understand the joint effort that bots have now initiated with humans, limiting the goals reached collectively. To help non-profits coordinate the volunteers recruited by online bots, we propose BotViz. BotViz is a new online platform that via data visualizations provides outsiders a clear understanding of the interactions of bots with volunteers. Our data visualization presents two benefits related to traditional interfaces: 1) Diversity, wherein people can understand the diversity of the volunteers, especially their unique strengths; 2) Stalling, wherein people who may be delaying the collective effort triggered by bots can be easily identified by volunteers. Together, our data vi-sualizations point to a future where humans and online bots can better collaborate in order to have large scale impact.},

It is usually believed that the local reviewers have a better understanding of the business hosts in their regions and their reviews are much more influential. How-ever by analyzing the reviews on a popular review site Yelp, we show that the reviews provided by the non-local review-ers (“outsiders”) converge over time while local reviewers are much more decentralised and provide mixed choices to the consumers. In order to identify the possible reasons for this, we unfold a series of systematic differences in the reviewing characteristics of the outsiders that make them strikingly different from the insiders.},

This is the approach that has been already proved to be very successful for data mining problems by web services such as Kaggle. During our project we adapted this concept for solving computational problems that require implementation of software. To achieve this we designed the on-line judge system that receives algorithmic solutions in a form of source code from the crowd of programmers, compiles it, executes in a homogeneous run-time environment and objectively evaluates using the set of test cases. It was verified during internal experiments at the Poznan University of Technology and it is now ready to be presented to wider audience.},

abstract = {Given the popularity of GPS-enabled smart devices, location-based social networks (LBSNs) have attracted numerous users around the world. The openness of LBSN platforms has also made themselves the targets of malicious attack-ers. In LBSNs, attackers can register a number of fake iden-tities and let them post spam reviews or fake check-ins. Therefore, discovering and blocking the malicious accounts are vital for the experience of legitimate users. In this pa-per, we investigated how to accurately detect malicious ac-counts in LBSNs. We collected rich user data from a pop-ular LBSN in China, so-called Dianping. We then built a crowdsourcing based annotation platform to mark legitimate and malicious accounts. By examining the annotated data set, we selected a number of key features to distinguish between these two types of accounts. Based on these fea-tures, we built LBSNShield, a machine learning-based mali-cious account detection system. According to our extensive evaluation, our system can achieve an F1-score of 0.89.},

We foresee how new interconnected knowledge systems - objects/devices, buildings and even cities created from web-based services and IoT - thoroughly transform CSCW. A wide spectrum of services already invites users to seamlessly move between real and virtual workspaces, using a range of previously separated media channels. This interdisciplinary workshop welcomes researchers and practitioners to a day-long exchange targeting User eXperience (UX) and, specifically, the relationship between social and spatial connectedness in mediated and virtual work environments.

The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers with diverse, yet convergent interests in tabletop, surface, mobile and wearable technologies, and those interested in the social aspects of interaction, such as conversation analysis and ethnomethodology. These communities have matured considerably, and produced significant exemplars of systems, methods, and studies concerned with collocated interactions. Yet, new challenges abound as people wear and carry more devices than ever, creating fragmented device ecologies at work, and changing the ways we socialise with each other. In this workshop we seek to start a dialogue to look back as well as forward, review best practices, discuss and design paper-prototypes using the collocated design framework, to consider how we might address new and future challenges through collocated design practice.},

abstract = {Previous workshops examined how individual users adopt and adapt technologies to meet local needs, “completing design through use.” However, there has been little systematic study of how groups engage collaboratively in these activities. This workshop opens a discussion for these forms of collaborative appropriation, including field studies, design explorations, theoretical accounts, and critical reflections.We invite submissions addressing the following and other topics in collaborative appropriation: Practical experiences in design for collaborative appropriation Flexible, open design and tailorability as support for collaborative appropriation Design goals, guidelines, and principles for collaborative appropriation Major drivers to design for collaborative appropriation Emergent roles (actors) in collaborative appropriation practices Characterization and differentiation of collaborative appropriation between couples, teams, groups, and communities Lessons learned from other design movements and research domains to inform the design for collaborative appropriation},

abstract = {Social signaling theory (SST) is an analytical approach for interpreting interactions in social settings that are not ostensibly explicit. Social computing researchers are beginning to apply SST to study questions of identity, trust, reliability, and multi-cultural communication. Example framing questions include: Relationships: How does social signaling theory complement existing theories used for studying social computing systems? Applications: What types of questions about social computing systems cannot currently be answered from an SST stance? Interventions: How can Social Signaling Theory be leveraged to facilitate the design of next generation social computing systems? During this workshop, through a variety of creative activities and lively discussions, we will begin to unpack SST, map how it is currently being used in research, and investigate the potential for future exploration.},

This workshop seeks to bring the emerging community together to explore how the new domain of “sharing economy” research could help shift forward broader conceptual and theoretical efforts within CSCW, and how, on the other hand, we might utilize prior work more effectively to inform our research agenda and efforts in this emerging sub-area of the field. In particular, the workshop focuses on the future of platforms as sites of work, collaboration and trust. The workshop approaches sharing and the “sharing economy” phenomenon inclusively, adopting a “big tent” approach to invite broad participation. The one-day event will consist of diverse activities, with an emphasis on in-depth conversations, community building, and support for establishing new collaborations.},

Programs like Zooniverse, Fold.It, and SciStarter demonstrate the power of recruiting online volunteers as participants and contributors to research. Platforms like Project Implicit and Volunteer Science confirm that a wide range of social scientific research can be conducted with volunteers in online laboratories. In this workshop, a group of scholars with wide-ranging experience in this area will discuss existing and emerging approaches to online experimentation. Participants will learn about designing and running online studies and will be given access to the Volunteer Science research platform (volunteerscience.com) where they will work with researchers to develop, test, and deploy their own online studies.},

abstract = {Emergencies are critical situations that demand immediate action to avoid adverse consequences to life and property. A key challenge in Emergency Management is decision-making under time pressure, with an overload of unconfirmed, uncertain and conflicting information, including the management of many people, with distinct and possibly fluid roles, in different places. Collaboration in these settings is an interesting element, since emergency response generally involves multiple agencies and the public, which have different views, protocols and priorities, but must act in concert to handle the situation. In addition, an increasing amount of virtual information is necessary to inform and manage volunteers. The goal of this workshop is to identify and map the main challenges of collaboration in crisis situations, review current research methods and approaches to address them and from there to address the lack of formal processes, structures, methodologies and tools, following a multidisciplinary approach.},

abstract = {The workshop focuses on the new work ecologies emerging from implementation and use of information infrastructures in healthcare (IIH). As IIH “grows” through organizational and regulatory mechanisms, CSCW researchers grapple with the shifting nature of healthcare data. CSCW has long been concerned with coordination, cooperation, and communication among interdisciplinary occupations in healthcare. Yet, while medical record keeping is still a primary function of IIH, second order data usages are increasingly large foci of IIH design and use. Facilitating development of health data practice and infrastructure is an area ripe for CSCW research. Critical topics include but are not limited to: re-use of clinical data for second order usages; design of artifacts and infrastructures; politics of creating and using data; algorithmic authority of IIH and effects on the exercise of expertise and discretion of healthcare professions; new forms of healthcare data work, including new occupations; data-driven accountability and management in healthcare”},

abstract = {There are new potentials for transformative developments in government, work life, science, and emergency response as the use of participatory and social media has become widespread in society and enabled a more collaborative information production. However, these new platforms for participation have not solved many of the pre-crowd problems regarding participation, such as lack of representativeness and flawed deliberative processes. Therefore it is important and relevant to look at the power relations within crowd production and to examine how different tools handle participatory processes in the crowd. This workshop examines different types of participation in crowd work such as crowdsourced policymaking, crisis management, citizen science and paid crowd work, among others, focusing on relations and power dynamics within and beyond the crowds. We welcome researchers from a diversity of disciplines and perspectives to formulate a typology of participation in crowd work.},

Computational approaches provide researchers access to broad assemblages of data, but the insights extracted may lack the rich detail that qualitative approaches have brought to the understanding of sociotechnical phenomena. How do we preserve the richness associated with traditional qualitative methods while utilizing the power of large data sets? How do we uncover social nuances or consider ethics and values in data use? These and other questions are explored by human-centered data science, an emerging field at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), human computation, and the statistical and computational techniques of data science. This workshop, the first of its kind at CSCW, seeks to bring together researchers interested in human-centered approaches to data science to collaborate, define a research agenda, and form a community.},

What animates many of these debates is a perceived lack of clarity as to what algorithms actually are, what precisely they do, and which human-technology-relations their application may bring about. Therefore, this CSCW workshop critically discusses computational algorithms and the diverse ways in which humans relate to them-focusing particularly upon work practices and investigating how algorithms facilitate, regulate, and require human labor, as well as how humans make sense of and react to them. The purpose of this workshop is threefold: first, to chart the diversity of algorithmic technologies as well as their application, appropriation, use and presence in work practices; second, to probe analytic vocabularies that account for empirical diversity; third, to discuss implications for design that come out of our understandings of algorithms and the technologies through which they are enacted.},
