abstract = {Urban cycling is often a solitary pursuit, as many cities do not provide infrastructure to facilitate social cycling, such as protected bike lanes. Negotiating congested streets can be stressful, even under the best conditions. The challenges of obstacle avoidance are amplified at night, when reduced visibility increases the risk of collision. In order to promote social cycling at night, we introduce [Bike] Swarm. Inspired by the natural synchrony emerging in swarms of nocturnal insects such as crickets and fireflies, [Bike] Swarm automatically inducts cyclists into a collective of nearby riders. A removable sheath of white LED illuminators is attached to the bicycle frame, providing a baseline level of illumination. When cyclists enter a 5-meter radius of other [Bike] Swarm riders, their bicycle lights begin pulsating in unison, creating a visually unified presence and extending membership in a self-organizing community that is increasing safety cooperatively.},

abstract = {This demo presents ModelLens, an interactive system designed to support data science teams in their model improvement practices. A central component of improving models is analyzing model errors, often incorporating feedback on the model's precision and recall performance (e.g., differences between the model's predicted label and its actual label). Today, error analysis is typically an ad hoc, team-specific process, largely accomplished through spreadsheets. ModelLens offers a unified view of feedback from multiple sources, the ability for data scientists to explore the context of an individual feedback instance, as well as a customizable ontology to enable collaborative and systematic annotations of model errors.},

Participants used a variety of technology channels to connect with others to express their moods and create solutions to challenges. However, these connections can also be a source of conflict. Next, I will investigate collaborations between individuals managing depression and their close ties to understand how these activities play out in-person and through technology.},

In my dissertation, I examine how social media news consumption impacts the viability of online political deliberation around news content. Specifically, I investigate how civil discourse is shaped in relation to political hashtags in the headlines and texts of social media news posts.

abstract = {Research on health practices, particularly around patient records in CSCW and HCI largely has underlying assumptions like individualism, emotional minimalism, recording clinical evidence, etc. We break away from this over simplification, that forgoes cultural categories like beliefs and assumptions about illness, technology and, gender roles, etc. This paper provides overview of ongoing dissertation research seeking to examine socio cultural aspects evoked within obstetrics and gynaecology (OB/GYN) outpatient consultation and how this leads to variations in EMR use. We have identified case study as suitable research strategy and principles of grounded approach will be applied while analyzing data. We hope to bring more nuanced understanding of cultural mechanisms in creating variations in use of health IT.},

First, research has been focusing on smart home users' privacy perceptions rather than other stakeholders in a smart home considering various social factors. These social factors may include social relationships (e.g., guests and homeowners) and various social contexts (e.g., temporary residency). Second, most existing privacy mechanisms for smart homes are either proposed or implemented by researchers without users' input or designed solely for smart home users. This project takes the first attempt to fill these gaps.},

Qualitative evaluation further demonstrated that screen brightness can also play a role in reliability for volunteers using mobile devices. These findings can be taken into consideration in the design and testing of apps and platforms for crowdsourced image classification to support reliability and data quality.},

We then used this temporal/spatial data to study crowd density and the behavior of GHM's visitors and compared them with the reported figures published by GHM's officials. Initial results show that Snap Map can be useful in understanding crowd behavior and detecting certain events, and may potentially be used in crowd size prediction.},

We then discuss preliminary insight from a survey to faculty prompting them to create their profile page and provide feedback on its design. The created profiles indicate that faculty embrace profile pictures as tools for conveying their expertise and resources rather than their physical appearance. Furthermore, functionality to link the profiles of users who are currently working together should be considered as a way to convey combined collaboration potential.},

Along with this growth, however, there is an increasing concern over the lack of control social media users have on the content they are shown by invisible algorithms. In this paper, we introduce Gobo, an open-source social media browser system that enables users to manage and filter content from multiple platforms on their own. Gobo aims to help users control what's hidden from their feeds, add perspectives from outside their network to help them break filter bubbles, and explore why they see certain content on their feed. Through an iterative design process, we've built and deployed Gobo in the wild and conducted a pilot study in the form of a survey to understand how the users respond to the shift of control from invisible algorithms to themselves. Our initial findings suggest that Gobo has potential to provide an alternate design space to enhance control, transparency, and explainability in social media.},

While the editor interactions in the English Wikipedia have been researched extensively, these other language editions remain understudied. To understand how editors currently come to consensus in article building in the Spanish language, a team of researchers has leveraged an existing English framework that depicts how power and policies play a role in mass collaboration. Using this English language framework, we are utilizing qualitative coding methods to build a unique model of the editor interactions on the Spanish language Wikipedia (ES). The results of this study will help contribute to a deeper understanding of how a framework in a different language edition of Wikipedia varies from the English. Our preliminary findings show that the power plays utilized in the Spanish Wikipedia talk pages differ in type and amount from power plays identified in the talk pages in the English language Wikipedia (EN), suggesting different forms of editor interactions and facilitation strategies across this multilingual platform.},

However, CAs with voice interfaces pose unique challenges for those with different accessibility needs - specifically, older adults with hearing loss.There has been little work to understand how deaf older adults leverage CAs and the challenges they face while using voice interfaces. To address this gap, we conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 4 deaf older adults to understand how and why they use CAs. We explore their expectations for their devices and identify common challenges (e.g., default voices used by commercial CAs). We provide suggestions for designing CAs that can better accommodate a range of hearing abilities and provide the first step forward toward a more inclusive CA.},

abstract = {Existing studies have not reached a consensus with regard to how social media may positively or negatively affect users' well-being. In this study, we endeavor to contribute towards HCI/CSCW knowledge on this open space and offer more empirical evidence. In doing so, we conducted 10 semi-structured in-depth interviews to explore the downsides of social media. We present four themes in social media use that adversely affect users' well-being emerging in participants' self-reports, namely, social comparison, fear of missing out, political discussions, and cyberbullying. Furthermore, we discuss two potential dynamics through which people consider their social media use negative to their well-being: 1) self-oriented internalization where users perceive the social media experience differently (negative or neutral) based on their personality traits; and 2) content-oriented internalization where users perceive the experience negative regardless of their personality traits. We argue that identifying these two dynamics of internalization helps understand the complex relationships between social media use and user well-being, which can then inform the future design of social media systems to remedy these adverse social and psychological impacts.},

abstract = {The Cambridge Analytica scandal triggered a conversation on Twitter about data practices and their implications. Our research proposes to leverage this conversation to extend the understanding of how information privacy is framed by users worldwide. We collected tweets about the scandal written in Spanish and English between April and July 2018. We created a word embedding to create a reduced multi-dimensional representation of the tweets in each language. For each embedding, we conducted open coding to characterize the semantic contexts of key concepts: "information", "privacy", "company" and "users" (and their Spanish translations). Through a comparative analysis, we found a broader emphasis on privacy-related words associated with companies in English. We also identified more terms related to data collection in English and fewer associated with security mechanisms, control, and risks. Our findings hint at the potential of cross-language comparisons of text to extend the understanding of worldwide differences in information privacy perspectives.},

As only a relatively small number of social workers are certified in providing the relevant support, there may be few colleagues to discuss with and learn from, even in larger municipalities with many social workers. To support social workers in providing the best possible support, the web-based collaborative tool PYCIPEDIA has been co-designed with social workers from two Swedish municipalities. The tool allows social workers to log in, and independent from what municipality they work in, create, browse, edit and share material (e.g. text, images and video) that can support the parents. They can discuss cases, rate online material, and access a forum.},

Organized yet informal reading and discussion groups are crucial resources for many scholars in interdisciplinary fields, yet such groups are difficult to start and maintain, very difficult to learn about and join, and only rarely involve participants from multiple institutions. Simply put, greater visibility into who's reading what and a way participate in these conversations would keep interdisciplinary scholars more connected with each other and with the various fields they follow. Perhaps even more importantly, a system which could collect this information could eventually offer a view into an otherwise part of the intellectual graph not visible via citation analysis or altmetrics, providing a platform for future research. Informal academic discussion groups are poorly studied, and though this paper relies on personal experience rather than qualitative research, it represents a first step in better understanding and serving these communities.},

We analyzed 57 posts from a forum for persons with dementia. Our findings indicate that users engaged with these forums as a means for self-expression, to connect with others, and to identify necessary resources. While seeking these types of information and support, persons with dementia sometimes provide private and vulnerable information as well as direct medical data, often in identifiable ways that would violate HIPPA standards. The tensions between need for support and the information shared presents interesting new challenges and opportunities for CSCW researchers.},

The system also serves as a survey instrument and we use it to collect data on the percentage of people who have their voter ID cards that enable them to vote. Extending past work on IVR-based mass awareness, we employ a different way of presenting content---a quiz instead of a tutorial---and of incentivizing usage---no monetary incentive for referrals except for specified referrers. In 24 days of deployment, over 1900 people have called the system, out of which 1245 answered all questions correctly in their first attempt, and 234 answered correctly after learning from their initial incorrect answers.},

Smart-speakers employ light behaviors to indicate a wide range of device states as well as notifying users. However, no prior work has looked into the efficacy of these light behaviors in smart-speakers. That is, can users distinguish and understand information states associated with different light behaviors in smart-speakers? In this work, we aim to address this gap by investigating whether users can accurately identify light behaviors in Amazon Echo and Google Home devices. For this, we conducted an MTurk survey with 243 smart-speaker owners. Our findings reveal that only 34% of the light behaviors are correctly recognized by users on average. Moreover, we found that users find it easier to recognize light behaviors in Amazon Echo than in Google Home devices. These findings show a clear need for rethinking the design of light behaviors in smart-speakers. We also explored novel light behaviors that users might find useful but are not supported by current devices including expressing sentiment and privacy notifications.},

In the case of EarthCube, data interoperability through the envisaged cyberinfrastructure remains elusive. Recent themes in CSCW literature examine questions of infrastructure and infrastructuring [17]. A goal of this poster is to illustrate the potential to use analysis of geoscience infrastructure to add to these discussions. The relevance of data interoperability is significant given the large amounts of funding and effort being put towards this goal and the potential for data interoperability to foster new scientific insights. Finally, examining this topic is even more salient given the recent emphasis on "FAIR data."},

Previous research shows that computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools have the potential to help newcomers adjust to new environments. However, it is not clear what the role of communication tools is in newcomer international students' adaptation to the US. We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with international students from China, Korea, and Japan to understand their adjustment challenges and how they use CMC tools to address them. We found that international students use CMC tools for finding reliable information, building new social networks, and providing an alternative channel for engaging in the US classroom. Based on these findings, we propose design implications for tools to better support international students' adjustment to the US.},

abstract = {Collaborative learning has potential to serve as a platform for fostering social connection, particularly in non-traditional contexts. Recent years have seen an increase in (long overdue) interest in supporting communities within such contexts through research. This has been often approached through ethnographic methods such as naturalistic observations, which are suitable for smaller, marginalized populations, However, the analysis of data produced by such methods often lack standardization, which limits generalizability of results and makes comparison across populations and learning contexts challenging. In this paper, we argue how greater grounding of data analysis in collaborative learning theories can provide standards for more meaningful comparison across contexts. We review Vygostky's social learning theories, shared social regulation of learning, and the trialogical approach. We discuss how anchoring inductive and deductive approaches in social frameworks may yield standardization metrics for unstructured, qualitative data from studies of social learning. We base this in our ongoing research on collaborative language learning between immigrant grandparents and grandchildren.},

The findings of the study have implications for usability and future design of smart-speakers. We also explored how the enhanced interactions in smart-speakers through back-channeling can be used for self-centered therapy leading to betTer emotional and social support.},

However, little is known about how to design such a chatbot and how group members react to its presence. As an initial exploration, we design GremoBot based on text analysis technology and emotion regulation literature. We then conduct a study with nine three-person teams performing different types of collective tasks. In general, participants find GremoBot useful for reinforcing positive feelings and steering them away from negative words. We further discuss the lessons learned and considerations derived for designing a chatbot for group emotion management.},

The result of our analysis of four movements as represented on Twitter (#BlackLivesMatter, #WhiteLivesMatter, #AllLivesMatter, and #BlueLivesMatter) reveal that #BlueLivesMatter represents values such as Care, Harm, Loyalty, and Authority, while #WhiteLivesMatter features Harm and Fairness. Moreover, we find that Harm is the most prominent moral value in all of our datasets. Our analysis provides a robust understanding of authors' moral stances, which contextualizes the influence of movements on people, and how these movements are perceived in society.},

In this study, we formulate MicroLapse, a function that expresses a maximal error in working time prediction that workers can accept for a given working time length. We collected 60,760 survey answers from 660 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to formulate MicroLapse. Our evaluation of our previous method based on MicroLapse demonstrated that our working time prediction method was fairly successful for shorter microtasks, which could not have been concluded in our previous paper.},

For each subreddit, we investigated 300 posts and 500 comments. Using topic modelling, we identify and distinguish the main emergent types of posts and comments we find in these two subreddits. We find that posts in r/academia center more on the challenging aspects of academia such as plagiarism, working in academia, and mental health, whereas r/gradschool posts deal with more generic issues on graduate school life. However, we find that the way the community reacts and provides support via comments is similar in both subreddits, mostly by providing moral support and solidarity.},

To better design and utilize these technologies, it is critical to understand the landscape of existing modalities and how they influence the care of cancer patients. Here, we review recent advances in the development and implementation of provider-oriented systems for oncologic care. We propose that these developments may be effectively characterized based on where they are situated in the timeline of cancer care; that is, technologies for cancer detection and diagnosis, intervention and surgery, and longitudinal patient therapy/management. The utility and impact of this class of informatics technologies is highlighted through a comprehensive case analysis of Figure1, a mobile application tailored to improve the continuing clinical education among providers. The advances and advantages showcased by Figure1 demonstrate the potential for provider-centered HIT to facilitate open clinical collaboration, collective growth of medical human capital, and ultimately more effective, personalized cancer care.},

abstract = {This study reports research findings from a qualitative thematic analysis based study that examined the design aspect of the Bangladeshi ride-sharing service "Pathao''. We examined a total of 8000+ app review data for our study. Investigation of a ride-sharing app from a design perspective by analyzing app review data is novel. We categorized users complaints in (1) technical (2) user experience (UX) (3) payment and cost issues (4) driver-related issues as they were discovered from our data. Our research findings might not be generalizable across different platforms. Nevertheless, the outcome of this study will provide guidelines for designing new and improved ride-sharing experience in the future.},

abstract = {Asthma is the most common childhood chronic illness. Patients with asthma are recommended to have an asthma action plan (AAP) for long-term control and responding to worsening asthma symptoms. We investigated a mobile icon-based AAP (I-BAAP) to understand whether children comprehend the AAP and the icons which are a part of it. We conducted a 2-part study with 14 participants where we (1) assessed the comprehension via translucency rating of the icons (2) evaluated the comprehensibility and usability of the AAP through a scenario test. We compared our results of children with the results of caregivers in the previous study. Our study shows that there is a difference between children and caregivers in terms of the comprehension of the icons and I-BAAP. Redesign or adjustments of the icons and mobile I-BAAP are needed to accommodate the children's needs. We iterated the design and concluded with recommendations about how to improve mobile I-BAAP for asthmatic children.},

abstract = {Group facilitators often organize large co-located crowds into small groups where people can more effectively interact and learn from each other. However, current approaches for facilitating small group interactions typically do not capture data about the rapport and future potential of interacting groups. We introduce ProtoTeams, a system designed to facilitate and gather data from small group interactions by dynamically connecting people from larger co-located crowds, such as classrooms and hackathons, through personal mobile devices. The system randomly assigns subjects into groups, then guides them through short activities, at the end of which they evaluate their teammate preferences. We report preliminary results from three deployments in a university-level design studio course where students (N = 50) interact with peers on activities before forming teams for a quarter-long project. Results suggest that the system is intuitive and groups form efficiently. Few subjects report the environment being too hectic and activities too short to accurately evaluate their peers. Future studies will continue investigating the value of this tool in co-located team dynamics.},

This is a public health crisis, and draws our attention to systemic issues with US health care, as maternal mortality is a core statistic used to indicate health care quality. Responding to the increasing number of women dying during one of the most common experiences with the medical system will require organizing a diverse group of stakeholders over a long period of time. Due to the unevenly distributed nature of the crisis, with Black women 243% more likely to die in childbirth or from childbirth-related causes will also require us to incorporate underrepresented voices into the current system. To examine these issues, we conducted interviews with public health experts working to address maternal mortality. We found that articulation work practices in public health limit the ability of experts to initiate contact with the very stakeholders they need to build relationships with to address the rise in maternal mortality.},

However, the co-presence of instructor and potential learners is missing when experts pre-produce how-to tutorials or videos offline. Hence, the content being shared by experts may not meet future learners' needs. To ensure the instructional value of archived tutorials for future learners, we explored ways to improve content production by analyzing interactive social prompts from a social partner during the time when experts share knowledge. We paired experts with partners of varying expertise and asked them to freely interact with the experts along the process. To simulate sharing knowledge via video-recording, a cooking task was deployed and we asked cooking experts to think-aloud while executing a cooking task with feedback from one of three types of paired partners, including another cooking expert, a novice, or no partner. This study identified six types of social prompts that can inform the design of computer-mediated knowledge sharing. Moreover, content quality was rated and evaluated, which shows that the best when knowledge was shared with the aid of expert's prompts. This study provides understanding of how various types of social prompts affect the externalization of how-to knowledge for asynchronous knowledge transfer between experts and future learners.},

What can we learn about collaborative systems and practices from other communities of people with lived experiences of politics of collaboration? Our workshop will incorporate communal practices of grassroots movement building to explore what it means to examine designs of CSCW arti- facts and practices for the politics they embody and pro- mote. The workshop simultaneously is about grassroots approaches, and also leverages lessons we have learned from grassroots movements in the workshop structure.},

abstract = {Social media platforms are deeply ingrained in society, and they offer many different spaces for people to engage with others. Unfortunately, accessibility barriers prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in these spaces. Social media users commonly post inaccessible media, including videos without captions (which are important for people who are deaf or hard of hearing) and images without alternative text (descriptions read aloud by screen readers for people who are blind). Users with motor impairments must find workarounds to deal with the complex user interfaces of these platforms, and users with cognitive disabilities may face barriers to composing and sharing information. Accessibility researchers, industry practitioners, and end-users with disabilities will come together to outline challenges and solutions for improving social media accessibility. The workshop starts with a panel of end-users with disabilities who will recount their Perspectives of Successes and Barriers. Industry professionals from social media companies (e.g., Facebook and LinkedIn) will detail their Design Process and Implementation Challenges in a panel with questions from attendees. The attendees will share their work and tackle Open Challenges and Future Research Directions. This workshop will forge collaborations between researchers and practitioners, and define high-priority accessibility challenges for social media platforms.},

abstract = {When people experience major changes in their lives (e.g., relationship changes, transition from high school to college, realizing an LGBTQ identity, etc.), they often turn to social technologies to help navigate shifting identities and networks and find support and resources. People's experiences using social technologies during times of life transition, and how to better design such technologies, has been a major focus of social computing research. This workshop will gather researchers working in this space to discuss eight themes: life events vs. processes; changing identities; multiple overlapping life events; physical and digital transitions; technology non-use during life transitions; liminality framework; theoretical frames; and methodological considerations. Collaboratively, we will 1) synergize insights from workshop organizers' and participants' research to determine how social technologies can be designed to better support people during life transitions and 2) outline an agenda for the future of social computing work on life transitions.},

Working in physical spaces allow opportunities for social support, long-term growth, and stability. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate a discussion around how physical spaces and online technologies influence each other in on-demand work. We plan to invite a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers studying these topics, grassroots organizers who can represent and voice the concerns of their respective worker communities, and designers of on-demand work platforms. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be archived online and made available to the larger research community and the general public.},

While a growing body of work has studied commercial content moderation in the context of platform governance and policy enforcement, only a small number of studies have begun to explore the work of unpaid, volunteer community moderators who manage the millions of different subcommunities that exist on platforms. This workshop will create a pathway for future scholars to tackle the challenges and opportunities of research on volunteer community moderators and establish best practices for engaging with volunteer moderators without disrupting their work. Through lightning talks, collaborative brainstorming exercises, and small-group activities applying principles to research practice, workshop participants will bring together their diverse experiences and perspectives to map the future of moderation research. Both industry and academic researchers as well as experienced moderators will lead this one-day workshop that may accommodate up to 20 participants.},

abstract = {By 2019, diversity is an established fact in most workplaces, teams, and work-groups, presenting both old and new challenges to CSCW in terms of team structure and technological supports for increasingly diverse teams. The research literature on diversity and teams has examined many definitions and attributes of diversity, and has described different types of teams, tasks, and measures, with contrasting and even contradictory results. Diversity becomes a strength in some studies, and a burden in others. The literature is similarly complex regarding individual and organizational approaches to realize those strengths, or to mitigate those burdens. In this workshop, we collectively take stock of these complex findings; we consider the several theoretical and methodological efforts to organize these findings; and we propose new research directions to address the "diversity of diversity studies.",0},

abstract = {As algorithmic (and particularly machine learning) decision making systems become both more widespread and make more important decisions, there are growing concerns about their embedded values and ability to establish legitimacy among decision subjects. We argue that designing for contestability in these systems can assist in surfacing values, aligning system design and use with context, and building legitimacy. However, designing for contestability can be challenging, particularly in systems that are designed to be opaque: systems need to accurately surface embedded values, expose decision making processes in ways that are meaningful for users, support engagement with and allow influence over system performance, and so on. In addition to these technical aspects, designing for contestability may by challenged by the need to protect intellectual property and prevent gaming of the system. In this workshop, we will address goals, audiences, and designs for contestability in algorithmic systems. We hope to develop a taxonomy of contestable systems and understand the value provided by contestability, while bringing together a community to work on this multidisciplinary problem.},
