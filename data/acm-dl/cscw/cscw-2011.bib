abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of digital technology, internet services and social media in our everyday lives allows for a seamless transitioning between the visible and the invisible infrastructure of cities: road systems, building complexes, information and communication technology, and people networks create a buzzing environment that is alive and exciting. Driven by curiosity, initiative and interdisciplinary exchange, the Urban Informatics Research Lab at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia, is an emerging cluster of people interested in research and development at the intersection of people, place and technology with a focus on cities, locative media and mobile technology. This paper seeks to define, for the first time, what we mean by 'urban informatics' and outline its significance as a field of study today. It describes the relevant background and trends in each of the areas of people, place and technology, and highlights the relevance of urban informatics to the concerns and evolving challenges of CSCW. We then position our work in academia juxtaposed with related research concentrations and labels, followed by a discussion of disciplinary influences. The paper concludes with an expos\'{e} of the three current research themes of the lab around augmented urban spaces, urban narratives, and environmental sustainability in order to illustrate specific cases and methods, and to draw out distinctions that our affiliation with the Creative Industries Faculty affords.},

Our research targets people who are just beginning to use computing technologies and services as well as those for whom access to computing still remains largely out of reach. Most of our work falls under the rubric of the relatively young field of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD or ICT4D). Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of ICTD, TEM is a multidisciplinary group engaged in a range of technical and social-science research. We work in the areas of cultural anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, and psychology, all of which help us understand the social context of technology and how it relates to communities and individual users. We combine this understanding with technical research in hardware and software to devise solutions for underserved communities in rural and urban environments around the world.},

abstract = {We present three studies that compare adoption and appropriation between China and the United States of BlogCentral, an internal blogging tool employed by a large global enterprise. We first analyzed 23 months of usage logs for users in both countries and found that compared to the U.S., Chinese users were much less active, with less activity and sparser user interaction. We then conducted 25 interviews and surveyed 213 bloggers in both countries to understand user motivations and behaviors of corporate blogging in more detail. The results show that Chinese employees use internal blogs for organizing personal work and short term team formation, unlike U.S. users who are driven more by the goal of sharing information to a broad community. The Chinese users were seeking (and not finding) greater social interaction and felt instead a sense of alienation from the global blogging community. We further identify a gap between Chinese users' requirement for local community and the existing global aspect of enterprise blogging tools. Lastly we discuss implications from the data analysis.},

We found that parents from different socioeconomic classes have different values and practices around technology use, and that those values and practices reflect structural differences in their everyday lives. Calling attention to class differences in technology use challenges the prevailing practice in human-computer interaction of designing for those similar to oneself, which often privileges middle-class values and practices. By discussing the differences between these two groups and the advantages of researching both, this research highlights the benefits of explicitly engaging with socioeconomic status as a category of analysis in design.},

abstract = {Long-distance couples face considerable communication challenges in their relationships. Unlike collocated couples, long-distance couples lack awareness cues associated with physical proximity and must use technologies such as SMS or telephony to stay in sync. We posit that long-distance couples have needs that are not met by prevailing communication technologies, which require explicit action from the sender as well as the receiver. We built CoupleVIBE to explore the properties of an implicit messaging channel and observe how couples would use such a technology. CoupleVIBE is a mobile application that automatically pushes a user's location-information to her partner's mobile phone via vibrotactile cues. We present qualitative results of a four-week user study, studying how seven couples used CoupleVIBE. A key result is that CoupleVIBE's implicit communication modality operated as a foundation that helps keep couples in sync, with other modalities being brought into play when further interaction was needed.},

abstract = {Awareness of other people's activity is an important part of shared-workspace collaboration, and is typically supported using visual awareness displays such as radar views. These visual presentations are limited in that the user must be able to see and attend to the view in order to gather awareness information. Using audio to convey awareness information does not suffer from these limitations, and previous research has shown that audio can provide valuable awareness in distributed settings. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of synthesized dynamic audio information, both on its own and as an adjunct to a visual radar view. We developed a granular-synthesis engine that produces realistic chalk sounds for off-screen activity in a groupware workspace, and tested the audio awareness in two ways. First, we measured people's ability to identify off-screen activities using only sound, and found that people are almost as accurate with synthesized sounds as with real sounds. Second, we tested dynamic audio awareness in a realistic groupware scenario, and found that adding audio to a radar view significantly improved awareness of off-screen activities in situations where it was difficult to see or attend to the visual display. Our work provides new empirical evidence about the value of dynamic synthesized audio in distributed groupware.},

In this paper, we propose a technique called "remote lag" to alleviate the problems caused by the invisibility of remote gestures. The technique provides people with instant playback of remote gestures to recover from the missed context of coordination. To examine the effects of the proposed technique, we studied four-person groups who engaged in two mentoring tasks using physical objects with and without remote lags. Our results show that remote lags effectively alleviated the invisibility problems, resulting in fewer questions/confirmations and redundant instructions during collaboration. The technique also decreased the overall workload of workers as well as the temporal demands for both helpers and workers.},

This will, we hope, enable us to balance image quality and update rate to deliver highly realistic and dynamic 3D human representations that offer the visual quality of high end video conferencing with the spatial and temporal characteristics of immersive virtual environments. The output of this will enhance communication by enabling a remote actor to be realistically projected into another person's local space, projected into an extension of the local space, or projected into a shared virtual space. This extends previous work by incorporating texture into the reconstructed form and evaluating the optimized process within our established simulation system.},

It takes advantage of commenters' participation as well as their knowledge and intelligence condensed in the sentiment of comments, thereby greatly reduces the high complexity of political view identification. We conduct extensive study on commenters' behaviors, and discover predictive commenters showing a high degree of regularity in their sentiment patterns.

In this work we examine the complex interplay between the needs and desires of news commenters with the functioning of different journalistic approaches toward managing comment quality. Drawing primarily on newsroom interviews and reader surveys, we characterize the comment discourse of SacBee.com, discuss the relationship of comment quality to both the consumption and production of news information, and provide a description of both readers' and writers' motivations for usage of news comments. We also examine newsroom strategies for dealing with comment quality as well as explore tensions and opportunities for value-sensitive innovation within such online communities.},

abstract = {Standard web browsers are becoming a common platform for delivering groupware applications, but until recently, the only way to support real-time collaboration was with browser plug-ins. New networking approaches have recently been introduced - based on re-purposed techniques for delivering web pages (Comet), or integration of real-time communication directly into the browser (HTML5 WebSockets). Little is currently known, however, about whether these new approaches can support real-time groupware. We carried out a study to assess the performance of the three different networking approaches, based on a framework of groupware requirements, in several network settings. We found that web-based networking performs well - better than plug-in approaches in some cases - and can support the communication requirements of many types of real-time groupware. We also developed two groupware applications using Comet and WebSockets, and showed that they provided fast and consistent performance on the real-world Internet. Our studies show that web-based networking can support real-time collaboration, and suggest that groupware developers should consider the browser as a legitimate vehicle for real-time multi-user systems.},

Example problems include difficulty synchronizing tightly-coupled collaboration, jarring changes in the user interface following the repair of conflicting operations, and confusion when participants discuss state that appears differently to each of them. Techniques exist that can help mitigate the effects of latency, both in the user interface and the groupware application. However, as these techniques necessitate the manipulation of state over time, the effort required to implement them can be significant. In this paper, we present timelines, a programming model allowing the explicit treatment of time in groupware applications. The model has been implemented as part of the Janus toolkit.},

Our system has attracted two million registered players since it was launched in late 2008. As the system went beyond a research prototype and reached a large number of real users, we observed performance issues that were mainly caused by unpredicted networking latencies over the public Internet and opportunistic distinction of roles such as active players and passive observers. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid consistency control approach that combines the merits of optimistic methods, which help achieve interactivity, and pessimistic methods, which guarantee consistency. As a result, the system can tolerate network round-trip time up to 230 ms, improving the latest work by 43.7%. In addition, the system can support over 1,000 simultaneous observers when a video game is played over the Internet.},

The results reveal that BBM social contacts are relationally closer and include more friends but fewer family and acquaintances than SMS. More deception was also observed in BBM, which included more lies about managing social interactions. The results have important implications for the impact of design features, such as PIN exchange, in text messaging.},

A key CSCW topic is how remotely situated people can collaborate around physical objects which are not mutually shared, without introducing new interactional problems. Our approach, grounded in an ethnographic study of a troubleshooting call centre, was to create a MR system centred on a shared 3D problem representation, rather than to use video or Augmented Reality (AR)-based systems. The key drivers for this choice were that given the devices are sensor equipped and networked, such a representation can create reciprocal viewpoints onto the current state of this particular machine without requiring additional hardware. Testing showed that troubleshooters and customers could mutually orient around the problem representation and found it a useful troubleshooting resource.},

Recent trends in increased work connectivity from home and blurred boundaries between work and home enabled more scheduling flexibility. While email use was understandably prevalent, there was also general interest in video, although obstacles remain for widespread usage. We propose several design implications for supporting this growing population of workers that need to span global time zone differences.},

Specifically, we argue that joint scientific work is organized around four separate registers, or 'rhythms' - organizational, infrastructural, biographical, and phenomenal - and that efforts to align such rhythms constitute an important and under-recognized aspect of collaborative work. The ideas and examples are drawn from our own field studies around IT infrastructure and collaborative practice across a range of scientific fields.},

We interviewed 65 Iraqi citizens who experienced the current Gulf War beginning in March 2003. In the context of a disrupted environment, trust in people and institutions can erode. We find that trust is contextual-as aspects of the physical world change, conceptions of trust can also change. We show how people were able to create a context of trust in the environment by using ICTs to manage their public identity, to conduct background checks, and to develop collaborative practices that relied on those with whom interpersonal trust previously existed. These new practices, in turn, enabled people to maintain work collaborations, to determine whether or not to continue interacting with others in public, to be able to travel safely, and to find trustworthy jobs. In developing these new practices we argue that technology enabled people to restore a sense of normalcy in an environment that had radically changed.},

Overall, workers performed better than chance, but results varied considerably depending on task difficulty. We find that treatment conditions which asked workers to prospectively think about the responses of their peers - when combined with financial incentives - produced more accurate performance. Other treatments generally had weak effects on quality. Workers in India performed significantly worse than US workers, regardless of treatment group.},

abstract = {There is a growth in the popularity of social file sharing systems. This paper describes the design of Cattail, a social file sharing system for the enterprise. Through a 'Recent Events' stream, Cattail supports social navigation and exploratory search by inferring relevant social connections rather than purely relying on user-specified contacts. Social navigation is further supported through pivot browsing from a consolidated history of user actions on an individual's files. Through usage log analysis over an 8-month period, we found that Cattail's novel network inference and social navigation features enabled a net gain of clickthroughs. Interviews with users revealed that this led to increased discovery of relevant people and content. We conclude with a discussion of several possible enhancements to the system. Findings from our research provide a strong foundation for the design of social file sharing systems for enterprise settings.},

Surprisingly, there is often management approval for these unofficial applications, but at the same time, desire to elimination these applications and only use the official applications. We discuss the implications of this finding for future collaborative applications and long-term record keeping.},

In addition, we observe regional differences in viewing behaviors between two groups of new employees. These results suggest that a SNS can also potentially contribute to the information-seeking and sense-making activities that underlie organization acculturation.},

We also found that the way the photos were organized moderated the impact of photo similarity, with diverging effects towards local versus distant team members. Our results indicate that photo sharing can promote positive behavior towards distant others under certain conditions. These results can inform the nature of photo sharing for team building.},

People preferred the flexibility of the latter, but ambiguity about its purpose and norms of usage persisted even six months after deployment and made some people hesitant to post. Also, using Twitter as the posting mechanism facilitated participation for some but also created barriers for those not using Twitter and for Twitter users who were wary of mixing their professional and non-professional contexts.},

Qualitative analysis of these interviews highlighted the ways that people think about with whom and how to share different types of information as they pursue social goals related to their personal health, including emotional support, motivation, accountability, and advice. Our study suggests that success in these goals depends on how well they develop their social networks and how effectively they communicate within those networks. Effective communication is made more challenging by the need to strike a balance between sharing information related to specific needs and the desire to manage self-presentation. Based on these observations, we outline a set of design opportunities for future systems to support health-oriented social interactions online, including tools to help users shape their social networks and communicate effectively within those.},

Using a normalized term frequency, we demonstrate how an effective table of contents can be extracted by finding localized "peaky topics". Second, we find "persistent conversations" which have a lower general salience but sustain and persist over the tweet corpus, in effect the whispering conversation that lingers in the background. These methods are demonstrated on a Twitter corpus of 53,000 tweets and a second Twitter corpus of 1.1 million tweets; the methods are generalizable to apply to any normalized scoring metric across a temporal corpus. We propose our method's implications on social media research and systems from a textual and social network analysis perpective.},

We found family was an extremely important context for sharing online, and that email was still a preferred form of communication for private sharing across facets of life. Single, working men had the highest level of incompatible facets, and a higher level of facet incompatibility was correlated with increased email usage and worry about sharing in the context of social networks.},

We make particular use of a framework first introduced by Agre that focuses on the influence of eight underlying features of computing practice: ontology, standards, instrumentation, authentication, interpretation, selection, bias, and performance. The results of this analysis indicate how representational systems do more than simply represent the physical world; they are deeply intertwined with the social and material practices of everyday life.},

These avatars were ranked comparatively with webcam photos, and users felt that they would be appropriate for work. Our results also revealed that realism is nuanced, as avatars in another cluster were also rated high on realism, but were felt to be inappropriate for work. Finally, this work also demonstrates that people are more particular concerning which type of avatar they are represented by, compared to ones they interact with.},

We investigated whether the aggregated privacy choices of one's social circle might guide users in making informed privacy decisions. We conducted an experiment in which users specified preferences for six privacy-relevant settings in Instant Messaging. In one condition, users were provided with information indicating the privacy preferences of the majority of their ``buddies." Our results suggest that while this information did influence user choices, the effect was secondary to that of the ``privacy-sensitivity" of the system feature controlled by the particular setting. Frequency of IM usage was also associated with privacy choices. The experiment data coupled with user comments suggest several usability improvements in interfaces for specifying privacy preferences.},

The bug-fixing process inher-ently has strong inter-personal dynamics at play, especially in how to find the optimal person to handle a bug report. Bug report reassignments, which are a common part of the bug-fixing process, have rarely been studied.In this paper, we present a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of the bug reassignment process in the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system project. We quantify social interactions in terms of both useful and harmful reassignments. For instance, we found that reassignments are useful to determine the best person to fix a bug, contrary to the popular opinion that reassignments are always harmful. We categorized five primary reasons for reassignments: finding the root cause, determining ownership, poor bug report quality, hard to determine proper fix, and workload balancing. We then use these findings to make recommendations for the design of more socially-aware bug tracking systems that can overcome some of the inefficiencies we observed in our study.},

While there are several potential technical solutions to this difficulty, we know little about social solutions, such as one user telling a peer about a tool. To explore these social solutions in one particular domain, we describe a series of interviews with 18 programmers in industry that explore how tool discovery takes place. These interviews provide a rich set of qualitative data that give us detailed insights into how programmers discover tools. One finding was that, while programmers believe that discovery from peers is effective, they actually discover tools from peers relatively infrequently. Another finding was that programmers can effectively discover tools from their peers both in a co-located and remote settings. We describe several implications of our findings, such as that discovery from peers can be enhanced by improving programmers' ability to communicate openly and concisely about tools.},

abstract = {Internet search engines display understanding or misunderstanding of user intent in and through the particular batches of results they retrieve and their perceived relevance. Yet understanding is not simply an automatic outcome but a joint interactional achievement between human and machine. If potential troubles with search queries emerge, either the user or the search engine may initiate repair on the query in ways that resemble repair in human conversation as described in conversation analysis. Users can repair their own queries in first or third position, while search engines can initiate repair from second position. However search-engine interactions currently contain no fourth-position repair. Finally search engines may also complete queries collaboratively with users in ways that are similar to but distinct from repair. In this study we examine interactions between users and search engines using a novel approach we call "computer interaction analysis," which utilizes eye-tracking screen video and a novel notation scheme for transcribing it.},

abstract = {Collaboration is key to safety and efficiency in Air Traffic Control. Legacy paper-based systems enable seamless and non-verbal collaboration, but trends in new software and hardware for ATC tend to separate controllers more and more, which hinders collaboration. This paper presents a new interactive system designed to support collaboration in ATC. We ran a series of interviews and workshops to identify collaborative situations in ATC. From this analysis, we derived a set of requirements to support collaboration: support mutual awareness, communication and coordination, dynamic task allocation and simultaneous use with more than two people. We designed a set of new interactive tools to fulfill the requirements, by using a multi-user tabletop surface, appropriate feedthrough, and reified and partially-accomplishable actions. Preliminary evaluation shows that feedthrough is important, users benefit from a number of tools to communicate and coordinate their actions, and the tabletop is actually usable by three people both in tightly coupled tasks and parallel, individual activities. At a higher level, we also found that co-location is not enough to generate mutual awareness if users are not engaged in meaningful collaboration.},

While role information is useful in coordinating time-critical work, our findings show that the current low-tech solution did not provide significant improvement in team coordination. The situations that were most in need of role-identification were the least likely to achieve it because role-tags required work by trauma team members. Similarly, because role-tags allowed workarounds and misuse, they proved ineffective in controlling the number of people in the room. We suggest technological ways of identifying roles to help coordination in the trauma bay.},

Themes and projects are loosely coupled in the sense that each research project is defined in its own right with a specific set of challenges, vision, approach, partners, and funding scheme. At the time of writing, GIRI has 3 research themes and are hosting 6 projects, but these numbers are expected to increase as GIRI grows. GIRI is an open research initiative, and we invite other researchers to join.},

In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

To compare these policies, we have a developed a formal analytical model that predicts their performance. It shows that the optimal scheduling policy depends on several factors including the number of cores that is available. We have implemented a system that supports all of the policies and performed experiments to validate the formal model. This system is a component of a self-optimizing scheduler we have developed that improves response times by automatically choosing the scheduling policy based on number of cores and other factors.},

abstract = {Multi-user chat (MUC) applications raise serious challenges to developers concerning scalability and efficient use of network bandwidth, due to a large number of users exchanging lots of messages in real-time. We propose a new approach to MUC message propagation based on an adaptable consistency model bounded by three metrics: Filter, Time and Volume. In this model, the server propagates some messages as soon as possible while others are postponed until certain conditions are met, according to each client consistency requirements. These requirements can change during the session lifetime, constantly adapting to each client's current context.We developed a prototype called ReConMUC (Relaxed Consistency MUC) as an extension to a well-known MUC protocol, which, by attaching a special component to the server, filters messages before they are broadcast, according to client consistency requirements.The performance results obtained show that ReConMUC effectively reduces the server outbound bandwidth, without significant increase in memory and CPU usage, thus improving scalability.},

abstract = {Current Web 2.0 services are making mass collaboration a reality. Using a Web browser, people can participate in cooperative work anytime, anywhere from any computing device as long as there is an Internet connection. Lying in the heart of some well-known services is an optimistic consistency control technique called operational transformation (OT). This paper proposes TIPS, a novel sync protocol that adapts OT for Web 2.0 applications. Based on a recent theoretical framework called ABT, it ensures not only convergence but also the right object order for linear documents. Designed to address the HTTP style of communication, TIPS allows clients to sync with the server by independent time intervals and dynamically join and leave at any time. When processing do operations, its time complexity is linear in the total number of operations generated by all clients during one server interval and independent of the size of history. TIPS is efficient for supporting a spectrum of (near-)realtime to asynchronous collaboration editing tasks.},

abstract = {It is important for users to understand the fundamental tradeoff between sharing information and preserving privacy in collaboration. The more information is shared about one's actions, the less privacy is preserved. Sharing information may, in fact, counter-intuitively result in increased social stress in some cases. Maintaining privacy while allowing for the sharing of information is an important consideration for successful collaboration and we believe display form factor matters for this tradeoff. New form factors such as spherical displays support privacy naturally, by limiting a user's view to at most one hemisphere. In this video we show how different types of interactive large display form factor can provide a balance between privacy and the sharing of information in a cooperative game.},

Remotely, an expert was explaining two algorithms to a novice who then attempted to apply the algorithm on an unseen problem. We report on an analysis of data from the conditions when there was a gaze transmitted and displayed to the peer with the no-gaze condition. The remote gaze display reliably affected the variability of novices visual attention patterns and they were better able to focus on the information presented. Without the experts gaze display their strategies contained greater variety.},

An efficient code running on the phone detects hand motion, delivers results to Serve PC and provides feedbacks in real time. Distinguished from online SNGS, all players stand together in front of a public display. The results of the pilot user studies showed that: 1) Gesture interface was easy to catch up and made the game more immersive; 2) Occasionally inaccuracy in hand motion detection made the game more competitive instead of frustrating players; 3) Players' performances were obviously influenced by the social atmosphere; 4) In most cases, players' performances became better or worse at the same time.},

We found significant change in participation levels around each event with both significant increases and decreases. We conjecture that participation increased if the action was perceived as supportive by developers (e.g. Sun's open sourcing of Java) whereas it decreased if the action was perceived as detrimental by developers (e.g. Oracle's acquisition of Sun).},

Its aim is to identify requirements for the task of brain tumour surgery, toward a wider project considering the development of a tumour removing robot. 5 brain tumour operations are observed using the ethnographic approach of work-practice observation informed by an ethnomethodological orientation. 4 observations are noted and corroborated with examples in evidence. We conclude that this study has identified potential requirements for a surgical robot, which would not have been highlighted using traditional approaches employed in the field of surgical robotics. These requirements may need to be validated with user-studies before being added to a requirements specification for a surgical robot.},

A qualitative study was conducted, in which 16 participants played variations of a team-based game with one of four kinds of team-mates: human (real or perceived) or AI (real or perceived). The two main findings of this research are that the perception of whether a team-mate is human or computer results in different credit/blame assignment and results in inaccurate skill assessment.},

It was experimentally demonstrated that the interruptions of AS are more acceptable than those during continuous work. Therefore, we constructed an algorithm that estimates the interruptibility of AS at three levels based on 19 selected indexes. The feasibility of the interruptibility estimation of AS was demonstrated by an estimation experiment using another dataset of 11 users.},

abstract = {As digital communities grow in size their feature sets also grow with them. Different users have different experiences with the same tools and communities. Enterprises and other organizations seeking to leverage these communities need a straightforward way to analyze and compare a variety of salient attributes of these communities. We describe a taxonomy and tool for crowd-sourcing user based evaluations of enterprise relevant attributes of digital communities and present the results of a small scale study on its usefulness and stability across multiple raters.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Express Location, a mobile web application, supporting drivers in delivery service in the daily coordination of work. Remote communication and cooperation takes place on a shared map view around the drivers' locations and next stop, through a drawing/doodling tool and multiple visual object representations. The aim is to understand the working situation and the use of locations in the daily work to better support the coordination of mobile delivery work.},
