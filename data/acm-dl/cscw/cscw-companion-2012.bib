abstract = {As more and more information is exchanged digitally, and as the tools for sharing and collaborating become more pervasive, users are presented with new opportunities and challenges in how they manage their personal information. Despite the traditional emphasis on the individual in research related to personal information management (PIM), it is apparent that family, friends, co-workers and other collaborators can strongly influence one's PIM behaviors. In this workshop, we will explore: 1) the role that other people play in an individual's PIM in a variety of collaborative and sharing contexts, and 2) the effects that web and cloud-based services are having on PIM practices. We focus on the challenges users face in an evolving communication ecology when sharing and exposing personal information in a variety of situations.},

Technologies such as idea management or argumentation tools, blogs, wikis, chats, forums, Q&amp;A sites, and social networks provide unprecedented opportunities for entire communities or organizations to express a discourse and act at a massive scale. This workshop seeks to understand the forms of CI that can be constructed through discourse and action, which enables advanced forms of collective sensemaking such as idea generation and prioritization, argumentation, and deliberation. When does effective discourse help a collective outperform individuals? What functions should the next generation of social platforms support? How can we allow communities to efficiently manage many diverse ideas, argument, and deliberate? What patterns in discourse and action can be modeled computationally?},

We understand mixed reality games as goal-directed, structured play experiences that are not fully contained by virtual or physical worlds. They transform existing technologies, relationships, and places into platforms for gameplay. While the design of mixed reality games has received increasing attention across multiple disciplines, a focus on the collaborative potential of mixed reality formats, such as augmented and alternate reality games, has been lacking. We believe the CSCW community can play an essential and unique role in examining and designing the next generation of mixed reality games and technologies that support them. To this end, we seek to bring together researchers, designers, and players to advance an integrated mixed reality games' research canon and outline key opportunities and challenges for future research and development.},

But designers can configure and make use of the same affordances to influence user behavior. As much of the connected world races to adopt social technology, we have a responsibility both to understand its impacts and to develop ethical guidelines for its use, as its impacts could be profound.},

abstract = {Social media is one way that individuals share information, present themselves, and manage their social interactions in both personal and professional contexts. While social media benefits have been examined in the literature, relatively little attention has been paid to the relationship of privacy to these benefits. Privacy has traditionally been framed as a way for individuals to protect themselves from the consequences of too much information disclosure. However, privacy can be a means to enhance social media outcomes and is essential for coordinating cooperative relationships. In this workshop we seek to: a) broaden the lens of social media privacy research to examine the benefits and outcomes of interactional privacy as they relate to social media goals; and b) discuss the design of social media interfaces that are responsive to both relational and privacy needs.},

This workshop aims to bring together CE academic researchers, industry developers, and end-users to discuss and exchange ideas on contemporary issues in researching, developing, and adopting CE systems. We have successfully organized this workshop annually at CSCW-related conferences. As CE systems are reaching more end-users, this year's workshop will, in addition to discussing classic CE technical topics, extend to cover issues that affect end-users' adoption of CE systems in their work such as privacy, security, usability, and social impacts of CE systems.},

In these systems, users can generate, share, judge, refine, and select ideas as part of a grassroots process. However, a class of users that lacks adequate support in current IMS are the facilitators. Their role is to help the best ideas to emerge and grow, while balancing the judgments of the crowd with those of the managers or the community leaders. We show how the dashboard helps facilitators in making more efficient and effective decisions in situations where the selection and judgment become prohibitively lengthy and time consuming.},

Audiotapes were transcribed and content analyzed. Results reveal three primary areas of iPad use: patient focused, professional focused, and education focused. Within each area residents commented on the iPad's current use, limitations, and future (potential) uses. Chi-square tests revealed significant differences within areas and across usage type. The present findings are the first from a multiyear study examining factors related to enhancing medical education and training.},

Individuals were formed into groups and used a mobile health application, VERA, to perform 'health behaviors' (such as indicating what they were eating or their exercise behaviors) for other group members via mobile posts. Initial results indicate that these performances tended to be more normatively descriptive than judgmental. In addition, in both cases comparisons between judgmental and descriptive performances showed more negative emotion with judgmental performances. Further analysis will involve determining normative performance patterns over time in the groups, as well as whether the performer's self report of emotion was similar to or different from the performed normative emotion. These findings will better our understanding of how norms are developed and used in group contexts, which could lead to more effective normative health interventions.},

We model collaboration as driven by individual-centered and group-centered rules. Context sharing is core to this process, but reveals difficult in the case of distant tangible communication. We propose to model collaboration as a trace-based process in which tangible object traces are stored, analyzed, enriched and shared. We draw on a normative multi-agent approach in which explicit norms are meant to operate at various levels, from the physical to the social level. These norms do not act as a prerequisite, or as a way to place a priori constraints on action. Rather, they result in a set of signs situating the activity. Such design offers novel ways for embedding activity theory in the current trend of socio-physical computing.},

We found that human assistance and collaborative behavior varied among different contextual situations. Above that User Experience (UX) factors such as trust and perceived safety have a main influence on the type of front-seat passenger assistance and level of collaboration.

We present a diary study, which focuses on the complete life spans of collaboration of four research teams. Each team of two was assigned to choose a research topic and prepare a presentation on an assigned date. The findings suggest that groups' interaction, collaboration and communication media choice were triggered by members' perception of time and research deadlines. This poster proposes that timing and teams' dynamic interaction and collaboration are inter-dependent, and that teams prefer rich media to compensate for the time constraints. Implications for theory, research, and practice are drawn.},

In order to provide better support for such variations, awareness-support systems need to inform colleagues and other stakeholders about the deviations from the plan.

We believe that reduced reliance on experts will in some cases lead to acceptable performance while reducing cost and latency. In this work, we show that we are able to approach the performance of an expert group for an image labeling task, while reducing our reliance on experts by incorporating non-expert responses.},

Annotations that pointed to few connections across documents hurt performance, especially when people were more aware of their partners. This research suggests that future collaborative tools should help people discern useful from useless annotations.},

A key research question is how to create a system that has accurate data while simultaneously protecting users from repercussions of having their identities revealed.},

First, we gathered tweets immediately after the earthquake and analyzed various factors, including locations.

On the other hand,(2) people in the other area prefer spread the information from the disaster area by using Re-tweet.},

Given that 97% of American teens play video games, there is a tremendous opportunity to engage students in STEM concepts within the framework of a multi-player game. Research has shown that eliciting emotional and affective responses in players can actively increase engagement, learning, and creativity, yet surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role of emotion within a collaborative multi-player gaming environment. We propose the design and development of an automatic game master that responds to the emotional states of players based on their in-game dialogue and actions. This research offers insights into affective interfaces that can improve the collaborative engagement of students and has implications for other collaborative learning environments.},

The emotional message cues people use to express their different emotions in IM communication and how their personality traits affect those cues are the main focus of this study. Results of a preliminary study in IM suggest that in stressful situations people apply significantly fewer vocal spelling emotional cues than in non-stressful situations. There is also a significant relationship between conscientiousness as a personality trait and use of lexical surrogate emotional cues in this type of communication. Our proposed study expands upon preliminary data to uncover more significant differences among the emotional message cues people use to express different emotions in IM, including the role of relevant personality traits. Identifying how users express emotions in IM assists researchers and designers in focusing on the users' emotional needs and results in the improvement of emotional communication strategies in IM.},

abstract = {Motivating students to be active in learning is a perennial problem in education. We describe our experience using Twitter for student "co-construction" of lecture materials. Students were required to tweet prior to each lecture related to that day's topic. These tweets - consisting of questions, examples and reflections - were incorporated into the lecture slides. Students reported that they found lectures including their tweets in class to be engaging, interactive and relevant, and nearly 90% of them recommended we use our co-construction approach again. Future iterations of this model could streamline the process by using automated processing and aggregation of tweets and/or having students in the class responsible for this.},

Receiving one negative initial feedback did not significantly affect membership, but sequential negative initial feedback decreased the likelihood of staying longer on the site.},

However, the specific effects of social media that impact productivity are not well understood. We perform a quantitative analysis of project success of over 5,000 open source software projects hosted on GitHub, a website that provides extensive social media functionality. Adapted from the open source literature, we develop two measures of project success, Developer Attention and Work Contribution. We find that projects with highly socially connected developers are not necessarily the most active or popular projects. Oddly, projects with a high level of developer multitasking, i.e., splitting effort equally across multiple projects, tend to receive less Developer Attention, but greater Work Contribution. Success on both measures is strongly positively associated with greater concentration of work among a small number of developers. We discuss the implications of the findings for social media in online production.},

However, training machines to correctly identify and subsequently extract tweets that contribute to situational awareness an overall picture of what is going on is a multi-faceted task that involves understanding what types of information people tweet during mass emergencies, how information differs depending on the type of situation, how various types of information are linguistically constructed, and how we can represent this knowledge in a computationally tractable way.},

In an attempt to address hidden profiles problem in computer-mediated communication, this paper presents a work-in-progress tool, Rationale Flower that visualizes the rationales exchanged through instant messaging in an online group decision making activity. In this study, a rationale is a member's explanation of why a piece of information should be brought to the group discussion. By this definition, it is expected that visualizing the members' rationales will not only attract group members' attentions to them but also support the group to testify and validate the unique information.},
