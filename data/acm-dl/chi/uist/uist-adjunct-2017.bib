abstract = {Multiplanes is a virtual reality (VR) drawing system that provides users with the flexibility of freehand drawing and the ability to draw perfect shapes. Through the combination of both beautified and 2D drawing, Multiplanes addresses challenges in creating 3D VR drawings. To achieve this, the system beautifies user's strokes based on the most probable, intended shapes while the user is drawing them. It also automatically generates snapping planes and beautification trigger points based on previous and current strokes and the current controller pose. Based on geometrical relationships to previous strokes, beautification trigger points act as guides inside the virtual environment. Users can hit these points to (explicitly) trigger a stroke beautification. In contrast to other systems, when using Multiplanes, users do not need to manually set or do any kind of special gesture to activate, such guides allowing the user to focus on the creative process.},

abstract = {Physical controls are fabricated through complicated assembly of parts requiring expensive machinery and are prone to mechanical wear. One solution is to embed controls directly in interactive surfaces, but the proprioceptive part of gestural interaction that makes physical controls discoverable and usable solely by hand gestures is lost and has to be compensated, by vibrotactile feedback for instance. Vibrotactile actuators face the same aforementioned issues as for physical controls. We propose printed vibrotactile actuators and sensors. They are printed on plastic sheets, with piezoelectric ink for actuation, and with silver ink for conductive elements, such as wires and capacitive sensors. These printed actuators and sensors make it possible to design vibrotactile widgets on curved surfaces, without complicated mechanical assembly.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a haptic feedback method that generates a compliance illusion on a rigid surface with a tangential force sensor and a vibrotactile actuator. The method assumes a conceptual model where a virtual object is placed on a textured surface and stringed to four walls with four springs. A two dimensional tangential force vector measured from the rigid surface is mapped to the virtual position of the virtual object on the textured surface. By playing vibration patterns that simulate the friction-induced vibrations made from the movement of the virtual object, we could make an illusion that the rigid surface feels like moving. We also demonstrate that the perceptual properties of the illusion, such as the stiffness of the virtual spring and the maximum travel distance of the virtual object, can be programmatically controlled.},

To address that, we explore the use of soft robots as supernumerary robotic fingers.

To address this issue, we propose AccelTag, a contactless IC card equipped with an acceleration sensor and a liquid crystal display (LCD). AccelTag utilizes high-function RFID technology so that the acceleration sensor and the LCD can also be driven by a wireless power supply. With its built-in acceleration sensor, AccelTag can acquire its direction and movement when it is waved over the reader. We demonstrate several applications using AccelTag, such as displaying several types of information in the card depending on the user's requirements.},

Tactile effects are created using directable water jets that spray onto the rear of a flexible screen, with different nozzles for different firework effects. Our approach is low-cost and scales well, and allows for dynamic tactile effects to be rendered with high spatial resolution. A user study demonstrates that the tactile effects are meaningful analogs to the visual fireworks that they represent. Beyond the specific application, the technology represents a novel and cost-effective approach for making large scalable tactile displays.},

abstract = {An actuated shape-changing interface with faster response and smaller pixel size using a liquid material can provide real time tangible interaction with the digital world in physical space. To this end, we demonstrate an interface that displays user-defined patterns dynamically using liquid metal droplets as programmable micro robots on a flat surface. We built a prototype using an array of embedded electrodes and a switching circuit to control the jump of the droplets from electrode to electrode. The actuation and dynamics of the droplets under the finger provides mild tactile feedback to the user. Our demo is the first to show a planar visio-tactile display using liquid metal, and is a first step to make shape-changing physical ephemeral widgets on a tabletop interface.},

We present GestAKey, a technique to enable multifunctional keystrokes on a single key, providing new interaction possibilities on the familiar keyboards. The system consists of touch sensitive keycaps and a software backend that recognizes micro-gestures performed on individual keys to perform system commands or input special characters.

During the game participants are provided with BCC wearables, each of which represents a specific RGB color. When the user stands, walks on, or touches with a hand the BCC tiles, communication is automatically established: the corresponding sensor area decodes the message (RGB value) originating from the wearable and lights up according to that color for two seconds. The goal of the game is to try to light up as many tile cells simultaneously as possible. Participants can try to keep alive the colors by continuously moving around on the tiles. In the multiuser version, by stepping on or touching a blinking cell, users can immediately claim the area and overwrite the color of that subtile.},

This paper presents a new fabrication framework that lowers the boundary of solving everyday issues with fabrication. A formalism and accompanying finite state machine (FSM) model that help assign a fabrication machine intelligence to appreciate humans' design actions was proposed, with a view towards a new fabrication framework empowering collaborative, incremental fabrication. Empowered by the novel framework, this paper envisions a future of fabrication that pushes the ceiling, a collaborative fabrication, processing intermittent, unpredictable events as live input and reflect them in the emerging outcomes by co-design process between a designer and a machine.},

The firm contact, however, might limit the location of wearable tactile displays and might be the source of discomfort when the skin is being exposed to prolonged contact. This motivated us to find a non-contact wearable tactile display, which is able to transfer information without a contact. Based on the literature review, we concluded that we should focus on airflow-based tactile displays among various non-contact stimulation methods. In my previous work, I proposed the concept of a non-contact wearable tactile display using airflows and explored its feasibility. Focusing on an airflow-based wearable tactile display, I am investigating the expressivity and the feasibility of wearable airflow displays in real-world environments. I expect my dissertation will provide empirical grounds and guidelines for the design of an airflow-based wearable tactile display.},

Such creative processes are not well defined and can evolve dynamically. We introduce interactive systems that help users collaborate and communicate in the open-ended process. In particular, we investigate the benefits of both integrating asynchronous interactions into real-time collaborations and of having real time components in asynchronous collaborative settings. The systems provide tools that combine the two different types of interaction techniques, and we validate them via user study, participatory performing arts, and the online deployments of systems and crowdsourced tasks. The hybrid methods are designed to help users recover collaborative context, make the process approachable to nonexperts, collaborate online crowds on demand in real-time, and sustain liveness during collaboration. The dissertation will result in cross-domain knowledge in designing collaborative systems and it will help us create a framework for future intelligent systems that will help people solve more complex tasks effectively.},

Similarly, as personal fabrication is made possible with accessible 3D printers, more intuitive tools that respect the physical constraints can help artists to prototype designs. One main hurdle is the sheer amount of computation complexity to accurately reproduce the real-world phenomena through physics-based simulation.

abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is widely used for outdoor navigation, but it is still challenging to apply this technology to a mid-scale or indoor environment. Using GPS in this way raises issues, such as reliability, deployment cost, and maintenance. Recently, companies like Google have begun to provide accurate indoor mapping. However, current implementations rely on both Wi-Fi and cellular technologies which have a hard time identifying the user's exact location in an indoor environment. There are two research questions in this paper: (1) How do we design a flexible and cost efficient indoor navigation system for organizations?

Here we propose Jaguar, which is a novel navigation system that utilizes a customized KML map with NFC technologies to address above questions.

abstract = {Voice assistant technology has expanded the design space for voice-activated consumer products and audio-centric user experience. To navigate this emerging design space, Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) provides a standard to characterize synthetic speech based on parametric control of the prosody elements, i.e. pitch, rate, volume, contour, range, and duration. However, the existing voice assistants utilizing Text-to-Speech (TTS) lack expressiveness. The need of a new production workflow for more efficient and emotional audio content using TTS is discussed. A prototype that allows a user to produce TTS-based content in any emotional tone using voice input is presented. To evaluate the new workflow enabled by the prototype, an initial comparative study is conducted against the parametric approach. Preliminary quantitative and qualitative results suggest the new workflow is more efficient based on time to complete tasks and number of design iterations, while maintaining the same level of user preferred production quality.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has numerous mechanisms for making a virtual scene more compellingly real. Most effort has been focused on visual and auditory techniques for immersive environments, although some commercial systems now include relatively crude haptic effects through handheld controllers or haptic suits. We present results from a pilot experiment demonstrating the use of Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) to trick participants into thinking a surface is dangerously hot even though it is below 50C. This is accomplished by inducing an artificial heat withdrawal reflex by contracting the participant's bicep shortly after contact with the virtual hot surface. Although the effects of multiple experimental confounds need to be quantified in future work, results so far suggest that EMS could potentially be used to modify temperature perception in VR and AR contexts. Such an illusion has applications for VR gaming as well as emergency response and workplace training and simulation, in addition to providing new insights into the human perceptual system.},

abstract = {Crowd-powered conversational assistants have found to be more robust than automated systems, but do so at the cost of higher response latency and monetary costs. One promising direction is to combined the two approaches for high quality and low cost solutions. However, traditional offline approaches of building automated systems with the crowd requires first collecting training data from the crowd, and then training a model before an online system can be launched. In this paper, we introduce Evorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant with online-learning capability that automate itself over time. Evorus expands a previous crowd-powered conversation system by reducing its reliance on the crowd over time while maintaining the robustness and reliability of human intelligence, by (i) allowing new chatbots to be added to help contribute possible answers, (ii) learning to reuse past responses to similar queries over time, and (iii) learning to reduce the amount of crowd oversight necessary to retain quality. Our deployment study with 28 users show that automated responses were chosen 12.84% of the time, and voting cost was reduced by 6%. Evorus introduced a new framework for constructing crowd-powered conversation systems that can gradually automate themselves using machine learning, a concept that we believe can be generalize to other types of crowd-powered systems for future research.},

We introduce a tool for automatically visualizing audio podcasts, currently focused on the genre of travelogues. Our system works by first time-aligning the transcript of a given podcast, using NLP techniques to extract entities and track how interesting or relevant they are throughout the podcast, and then retrieving visual data appropriately to describe them, either through transitions on a map or professionally taken photographs with captions. By automatically creating a visual narrative to accompany a podcast, we hope our tool can provide listeners with a better sense of the podcast's topic.},

On the contrary, olfactory stimulation can be performed while working, and it is effective also when the degree of arousal is low. This study considers applications on the basis of the concept of "smellization" of information using olfactive stimulation.

Among various types of screencast content, popular are the contents that involve text editing, including computer programming. There are emerging platforms that support such text-based screencasts by recording every character insertion/deletion from the creator and reconstructing its playback on the viewer's screen. However, these platforms lack rich support for creating and editing the screencast itself, mainly due to the difficulty of manipulating recorded text changes; the changes are tightly coupled in sequence, thus modifying arbitrary part of the sequence is not trivial. We present a non-linear editing tool for text-based screencasts. With the proposed selective history rewrite process, our editor allows users to substitute an arbitrary part of a text-based screencast while preserving overall consistency of the rest of the text-based screencast.},

Researchers try to use these display to simulate varied embodied feeling to enhance the immersion in the VR/AR environment. In the field of game entertainment, based on the scenario, sometimes the feeling of passing through the body need to be presented to the user. However this is physically impossible. Thus we make a exploration attempting to simulate this feeling by thermal feedback. Here we use two thermal modules bonding on the two side of the wrist( inside and outside). When we actuate two modules sequentially, user would perceive the stimuli and interpret this into a feeling of passing though. In the paper, we will introduce the interface and describe the experiment to determine the principle for thermo-tactile illusion of passing through.},

abstract = {Children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) have difficulties in expressing their feelings and needs, their teachers have to be very familiar with them to adjust teaching contents in related training lessons. In this paper, we present an adaptive training system with EEG (Electroencephalogram) devices for autistic children. We designed an EEG helmet to monitor children's attention levels, and a video chat system with virtual cartoon faces covered on teacher's face. Cartoon faces are synchronized with the performer's facial movements to help trainers express themselves in an exaggerated way. When the attention reduction is detected by the EEG helmet, cartoon face will adjust automatically, and try to draw their attention back through changing cartoon types, colors, brightness, etc. Each change and feedback from children will be traced by the helmet and analyzed for improvements. By continuous iterative learning, the system will become smarter in avoiding children's physical exhaustion. The system was introduced in the form of a specific training lesson to an ASD school, and preliminary experiment has indicated an encouraging result.},

abstract = {Children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) have social communication difficulties partly due to their abnormal avoidance of eye contact on human faces, yet they have a normal visual processing strategy on cartoon face. In this paper, we present KinToon, a face-to-face communication enhancement system to help ASD children in their training lessons. Our system use Kinect to scan human face and extract key points from facial contour, and match them to corresponding key points of a cartoon face. A modified cartoon face is projected to the communicator's face to achieve the effect of dynamic "makeup". ASD children will finally talk to the communicator with dynamic cartoon makeup, which would reduce their stress of interacting with people and make them easier to understand emotions. The interactive devices were applied to an ASD training lesson, and our creative approach was examined to be relatively effective in encouraging ASD children to fetch more emotional information and have more eye contact with people by eye tracking.},
