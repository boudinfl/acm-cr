abstract = {Momentary switches are important building blocks to prototype novel physical user interfaces and enable tactile, explicit and eyes-free interactions. Unfortunately, typical representatives, such as push-buttons or pre-manufactured membrane switches, often do not fulfill individual design requirements and lack customization options for rapid prototyping. With this work, we present Pushables, a DIY fabrication approach for producing thin, bendable and highly customizable membrane dome switches. Therefore, we contribute a three-stage fabrication pipeline that describes the production and assembly on the basis of prototyping methods with different skill levels making our approach suitable for technology-enthusiastic makers, researchers, fab labs and others who require custom membrane switches in small quantities. To demonstrate the wide applicability of Pushables, we present application examples from ubiquitous, mobile and wearable computing.},

abstract = {Today"s smartphone notification systems are incapable of determining whether a notification has been successfully perceived without explicit interaction from the user. When the system incorrectly assumes that a notification has not been perceived, it may repeat it redundantly, disrupting the user (e.g., phone ringing). Or, when it assumes that a notification was perceived, and therefore fails to repeat it, the notification will be missed altogether (e.g., text message). We introduce SweatSponse, a feedback loop using skin conductance responses (SCR) to infer the perception of smartphone notifications just after their presentation. Early results from a laboratory study suggest that notifications induce SCR and that they could be used to better infer perception of smartphone notifications in real-time.},

Our goal is to lower the user's perceptual load for augmented collaboration in shared space design scenarios. Applying attention theories, we implemented shared head gaze, shared selected object, and collaborative manipulation features in our system in two different versions with HoloLens. To investigate whether user perceptions of the two different versions differ, we conducted an experiment with 18 participants (9 pairs) and conducted a survey and semi-structured interviews. The results did not show significant differences between the two versions, but produced interesting insights. Based on the findings, we provide design guidelines for collaborative AR systems.},

abstract = {Across many domains, interactive systems either make decisions for us autonomously or yield decision-making authority to us and play a supporting role. However, many settings, such as those in education or the workplace, benefit from sharing this autonomy between the user and the system, and thus from a system that adapts to them over time. In this paper, we pursue two primary research questions: (1) How do we design interfaces to share autonomy between the user and the system? (2) How does shared autonomy alter a user"s perception of a system? We present SharedKeys, an interactive shared autonomy system for piano instruction that plays different video segments of a piece for students to emulate and practice. Underlying our approach to shared autonomy is a mixed-observability Markov decision process that estimates a user"s desired autonomy level based on her performance and attentiveness. Pilot studies revealed that students sharing autonomy with the system learned more quickly and perceived the system as more intelligent.},

In order to assess the feasibility of reference-based interaction techniques for watching videos, we introduce DynamicSlide, a video processing system that automatically extracts references from slide-based lecture videos and a video player. The system incorporates a set of reference-based techniques: emphasizing the current item in the slide that is being explained, enabling item-based navigation, and enabling item-based note-taking. Our pipeline correctly finds 79% of the references in a set of five videos with 141 references. Results from a user study suggest that DynamicSlide's features improve the learner's video browsing and navigation experience.},

abstract = {Despite advances in machine learning and deep neural networks, there is still a huge gap between machine and human image understanding. One of the causes is the annotation process used to label training images. In most image categorization tasks, there is a fundamental ambiguity between some image categories and the underlying class probability differs from very obvious cases to ambiguous ones. However, current machine learning systems and applications usually work with discrete annotation processes and the training labels do not reflect this ambiguity. To address this issue, we propose an new image annotation framework where labeling incorporates human gaze behavior. In this framework, gaze behavior is used to predict image labeling difficulty. The image classifier is then trained with sample weights defined by the predicted difficulty. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on four-class image classification tasks.},

Assisting technologies in form of augmented reality (AR) have previously been applied to support cognitively impaired users during IADLs. In most cases, instructions were provided locally via projection or a head-mounted display (HMD) but lacked an incentive mechanism and the flexibility to support a broad range of use-cases. To provide users and therapists with a holistic solution, we propose cARe, a framework that can be easily adapted by therapists to various use-cases without any programming knowledge. Users are then guided through manual processes with localized visual and auditory cues that are rendered by an HMD. Our ongoing user study indicates that users are more comfortable and successful in cooking with cARe as compared to a printed recipe, which promises a more dignified and autonomous living for dementia patients.},

abstract = {Research has been done in sophisticated notifications, still, devices today mainly stick to a binary level of information, while they are either attention drawing or silent. We propose scalable notifications, which adjust the intensity level reaching from subtle to obtrusive and even going beyond that level while forcing the user to take action. To illustrate the technical feasibility and validity of this concept, we developed three prototypes. The prototypes provided mechano-pressure, thermal, and electrical feedback, which were evaluated in different lab studies. Our first prototype provides subtle poking through to high and frequent pressure on the user's spine, which significantly improves back posture. In a second scenario, the user is able to perceive the overuse of a drill by an increased temperature on the palm of a hand until the heat is intolerable, forcing the user to eventually put down the tool. The last application comprises of a speed control in a driving simulation, while electric muscle stimulation on the users' legs, conveys information on changing the car's speed by a perceived tingling until the system forces the foot to move involuntarily. In conclusion, all studies' findings support the feasibility of our concept of a scalable notification system, including the system forcing an intervention.},

Due to the highly interactive and dynamic nature of the game, a participants individual impact on narrative and interactive aspects of the game is extremely high. The diversity of scenarios within this context unfold a variety of players needs, as well as factors limiting and enhancing game-play. Companion offers an audio management workspace for creation and playback of soundscapes based on visual layouting. It supports interactive image presentation and map exploration which can incorporate input from any device providing TUIO tracking data.

The developed system includes an I/O module, capable of measuring the electromyogram (EMG) of four muscle tissues, while applying electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) at the same time. The developed wearable system is configured in a scalable manner for achieving 1) high stimulus frequency (up to 70 Hz), 2) wearable dimensions in which the device can be placed along the limbs, and 3) flexibility of the number of I/O electrodes (up to 32 channels). In a pilot user study, which shared the wrist compliance between two persons, participants were able to recognize the level of their confederate's wrist joint compliance using a 4-point Likert scale. The developed system would benefit a physical therapist and a patient, during hand rehabilitation, using a peg board for sharing their wrist compliance and grip force, which are usually difficult to be observed in a visual contact.},

abstract = {Biased perceptions of others are known to negatively influence the outcomes of social and professional interactions in many regards. Theses biases can be informed by a multitude of non-verbal cues such as voice pitch and voice volume. This project explores how haptic effects, generated from speech, could attenuate listeners' perceived voice-related biases formed from a speaker's voice pitch. Promising preliminary results collected during a decision-making task suggest that the speech to haptic mapping and vibration delivery mechanism employed does attenuate voice-related biases. Accordingly, it is anticipated that such a system could be introduced in the workplace to equalize people's contribution opportunities and to create a more inclusive environment by reversing voice-related biases.},

abstract = {To filter and shut out an increasingly loud environment, many resort to the use of personal audio technology. They drown out unwanted sounds, by wearing headphones. This uniform interaction with all surrounding sounds can have a negative impact on social relations and situational awareness. Leveraging mediation through smarter headphones, users gain more agency over their sense of hearing: For instance by being able to selectively alter the volume and other features of specific sounds, without losing the ability to add media. In this work, we propose the vision of interactive auditory mediated reality (AMR). To understand users' attitude and requirements, we conducted a week-long event sampling study (n = 12), where users recorded and rated sources (n = 225) which they would like to mute, amplify or turn down. The results indicate that besides muting, a distinct, "quiet-but-audible" volume exists. It caters to two requirements at the same time: aesthetics/comfort and information acquisition.},

abstract = {One of the main drawbacks of the fixation-based gaze interfaces is that they are unable to distinguish top-down attention (or selection, a gaze with a purpose) from stimulus driven bottom-up attention (or navigation, a stare without any intentions) without time durations or unnatural eye movements. We found that using the bistable image called the Necker's cube as a button user interface (UI) helps to remedy the limitation. When users switch two rivaling percepts of the Necker's cube at will, unique eye movements are triggered and these characteristics can be used to indicate a button press or a selecting action. In this paper, we introduce (1) the cognitive phenomenon called "percept switch" for gaze interaction, and (2) propose "perceptual switch" or the Necker's cube user interface (UI) which uses "percept switch" as the indication of a selection. Our preliminary experiment confirms that perceptual switch can be used to distinguish voluntary gaze selection from random navigation, and discusses that the visual elements of the Necker's cube such as size and biased visual cues could be adjusted for the optimal use of individual users.},

This can hinder their effect, as creativity research has shown that ideators have unique cognitive structures and may therefore be better inspired by some ideas rather than others. We introduce CrowdMuse, an adaptive system for supporting large scale brainstorming.

abstract = {Physical buttons provide rich force characteristics during the travel range, which are commonly described in the form of force-displacement curves. These force characteristics play an important role in the users' experiences while pressing a button. However, due to lack of proper tools to dynamically render various force-displacement curves, little literature has tried iterative button design improvement. This paper presents Button Simulator, a low-cost 3D printed physical button capable of displaying any force-displacement curves, with limited average error offset around .034 N. By reading the force-displacement curves of existing push-buttons, we can easily replicate the force characteristics from any buttons onto our Button Simulator. One can even go beyond existing buttons and design non-existent ones as the form of arbitrary force-displacement curves; then use Button Simulator to render the sensation. This project will be open-sourced and the implementation details will be released. Our system can be a useful tool for future researchers, designers, and makers to investigate rich and dynamic button"s force design.},

abstract = {Eye tracking is expected to become an integral part of future augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) given that it can easily be integrated into existing hardware and provides a versatile interaction modality. To augment objects in the real world, AR HMDs require a three-dimensional understanding of the scene, which is currently solved using depth cameras. In this work we aim to explore how 3D gaze data can be used to enhance scene understanding for AR HMDs by envisioning a symbiotic human-machine depth camera, fusing depth data with 3D gaze information. We present a first proof of concept, exploring to what extend we are able to recognise what a user is looking at by plotting 3D gaze data. To measure 3D gaze, we implemented a vergence-based algorithm and built an eye tracking setup consisting of a Pupil Labs headset and an OptiTrack motion capture system, allowing us to measure 3D gaze inside a 50x50x50 cm volume. We show first 3D gaze plots of "gazed-at" objects and describe our vision of a symbiotic human-machine depth camera that combines a depth camera and human 3D gaze information.},

However, most quadcopter steering systems are complicated to use for non-expert users or require an expensive tracking system for autonomous flying. Safety-critical scenarios require trained and expensive personnel to navigate quadcopters through crucial flight paths within narrow spaces. To simplify the input and manual operation of quadcopters, we present DroneCTRL, a tangible pointing device to navigate quadcopters. DroneCTRL resembles a remote control including optional visual feedback by a laser pointer and tangibility to improve the quadcopter control usability for non-expert users. In a preliminary user study, we compare the efficiency of hardware and software-based controller with DroneCTRL. Our results favor the usage of DroneCTRL with and without visual feedback to achieve more precision and accuracy.},

As a case study, we share tactics used and strategies followed to conduct a pop-up style study of 'A robotic mailbox to support and raise awareness about homelessness.' We discuss benefits and challenges of the pop-up approach and recommend using it to enable the social studies of HRI not only to match but to precede, the fast-paced technological advancement and deployment of robots.},

Scout advances upon these systems by introducing high-level constraints based on design concepts (e.g. emphasis). With Scout, we have formalized several high-level constraints into their corresponding low-level spatial constraints to enable rapidly generating many designs through constraint solving and program synthesis.},

We present Face/On, a VR HMD face cushion with three types of discreetly embedded actuators that provide rich haptic feedback without encumbering users with invasive instrumentation on the body.

abstract = {Recent years saw an explosion in Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for consumers. These experiences can be classified based on the scale of the interactive area (room vs city/global scale) , or the fidelity of the experience (high vs low). Experiences that target large areas, such as campus or world scale, commonly have only rudimentary interactions with the physical world, and suffer from registration errors and jitter. We classify these experiences as large scale and low fidelity. On the other hand, various room sized experiences feature realistic interaction of virtual content with the real world. We classify these experiences as small scale and high fidelity. Our work is the first to explore the domain of large scale high fidelity (LSHF) AR experiences. We build upon the small scale high fidelity capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens to allow LSHF interactions. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system with a game specifically designed for LSHF interactions, handling many challenges and limitations unique to the domain of LSHF AR through the game design. Our contributions are twofold: - The lessons learned during the design and development of a system capable of LSHF AR interactions. ­ Identification of a set of reusable game elements specific to LSHF AR, including mechanisms for addressing spatiotemporal inconsistencies and crowd control. We believe our contributions will be fully applicable not only to games, but all LSHF AR experiences.},

abstract = {Communication between screens and cameras has attracted attention as a ubiquitous information source, motivated by the widespread use of smartphones and the increase of public advertising and information screens. We propose embedding matrix barcodes into images projected on displays by utilizing imperceptible color vibration. This approach maintains the visual experience as the barcodes are imperceptible and can be implemented on almost any display and camera for the technology to be pervasive. In fact, the color vibration can be generated by ordinary 60 Hz LCDs and captured by 120 fps smartphone cameras. To illustrate the technology capabilities, we present scenarios of potential practical applications.},

By using multiple OptRods, the PC can simultaneously operate many output devices without any signal lines. Moreover, we can arrange surfaces of various shapes easily by combining multiple OptRods.

Unlike electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), which can also present force sensation by stimulating motor nerves to contract muscles, TES is thought to present a proprioceptive force sensation by stimulating receptors or sensory nerves responsible for recognizing the magnitude of the muscle contraction existing inside the tendon. In the demo, we offer the occasion for trying TES.},

Our proposal uses frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) to realize a touch pad on the external surfaces of the HMD case; no special devices are needed. As simple FTIR approaches do not suit SbHMDs due to the spatial relation between camera and light, we design an arrangement of acrylic plates and mirror suitable for smartphone's built-in camera and torch-light. It extends the input vocabulary SbHMDs to include touch location, gestures, and also pressure.},

With our platform we evaluated two designs for using the rotation of a motorized swivel chair to alleviate this, wiggle and impulse. Our evaluation showed that impulse, using short rotation bursts matched with the visual acceleration, can significantly reduce simulator sickness and increase the perception of self-motion compared to no physical motion.},

The results indicate that there is a relationship between the shape of a knob and its haptic feedback. The perceived functionality can be dynamically altered by changing its shape and haptic feedback. This work serves as basis for the design of dynamic interface controls that can adapt their shape and haptic feel to the content that is controlled.

To increase acceptance of shape-changing interfaces by end-users, we need to provide designers with design criteria and framework closely grounded on their current skills and needs. Also, we need to provide them with prototyping tools to enable quick assessment of ideas in the physical world. In this paper, I introduce the three threads of my Ph.D. research in the direction of providing the design tools. First, I advance existing shape-changing interface taxonomies to broaden design vocabulary and systemize design framework, based on the classification of everyday objects. Second, I conduct a study with end-users to suggest interaction techniques and design guidelines for shape-changing interfaces from their current practice. Lastly, I develop a physical prototyping tool for shape-changing interfaces to shorten prototyping iterations based on well-known Lego-like bricks.},

abstract = {As interactions move beyond the desktop, interactive behaviours (effects of actions as they happen, or once they happen) are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity is due to the variety of forms that objects might take, and the different inputs and sensors capturing information, and the ability to create nuanced responses to those inputs. Current interaction design tools do not support much of this rich behaviour authoring. In my work I create prototyping tools that examine ways in which designers can create interactive behaviours. Thus far, I have created two prototyping tools: Pineal and Astral, which examine how to create physical forms based on a smart object's behaviour, and how to reuse existing desktop infrastructures to author different kinds of interactive behaviour. I also contribute conceptual elements, such as how to create smart objects using mobile devices, their sensors and outputs, instead of using custom electronic circuits, as well as devising evaluation strategies used in HCI toolkit research which directly informs my approach to evaluating my tools.},

abstract = {Locomotion,the most basic interaction in Virtual Environments (VE), enables users to move around the virtual world. Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is a problem which has not been solved completely since existing techniques have a specific set of requirements and limitations. In addition, the uncertainty about the impact that virtual cues have on users perception complicates the development of better locomotion interfaces. A broadly applicable locomotion technique that is easy to use and addresses the issues of presence, cybersickness and fatigue has yet to be developed. Though optical flow and vestibular cues are dominant in navigation, other cues such as auditory, arm feedback, wind, etc. play a role. The proposed research aims to evaluate and improve upon a set of locomotion techniques for different modes of locomotion in virtual scenarios, as well as the transitions between them. The outcome measures of the evaluations of the different scenarios are usefulness for spatial orientation, presence, fatigue, cybersickness and user preference. The envisioned contribution of my thesis is research towards the design of a locomotion technique that is easy to use and addresses the shortcomings of current implementations.},

abstract = {Mobile and wearable computing are increasingly pervasive as people carry and use personal devices in everyday life. Screen sizes of such devices are becoming larger and smaller to accommodate both intimate and practical uses. Some mobile device screens are becoming larger to accommodate new experiences (e.g., phablet, tablet, eReader), whereas screen sizes on wearable devices are becoming smaller to allow them to fit into more places (e.g., smartwatch, wrist-band and eye-wear). However, these trends are making it difficult to use such devices with only one hand due to their placement, limited thumb reach and the fat-finger problem. This is especially true as there are many occasions when a user's other hand is occupied (encumbered) or not available. This thesis work explores, creates and studies novel interaction techniques that enable effective single-hand usage on mobile and wearable devices, empowering users to achieve more with their smart devices when only one hand is available.},
