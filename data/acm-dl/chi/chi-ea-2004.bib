abstract = {This demonstration reports results from the EU-funded project Ambient Agoras, investigating future applications of ubiquitous and ambient computing in workspaces. Instead of presenting underlying system technologies or evaluation findings, this demonstration will focus on three running prototypes that emerged from the project: InfoRiver, SIAM, and Hello.Wall. The systems are meant to support work-related processes in office buildings while at the same time fostering informal communication. The InfoRiver implements the information river metaphor for information flow through a building or an organization. SIAM is a task-management system enriched with collaboration support to foster group communication and awareness. Hello.Wall is a new ambient display that can "borrow" mobile artefacts. All prototypes are multi-user and multi-device systems enabling coherent and engaging interaction experiences with a variety of sensor-enhanced smart artefacts.},

abstract = {Much past HCI research has examined the usability concerns of information management software for specific domains such as object-oriented software design, e-mail, and the Web. We believe that many of the results uncovered by these studies are applicable across multiple domains but that more broadly-scoped experiments require a system that can integrate multiple data sources. Haystack is a general-purpose information management environment designed to attack this very problem. Haystack's user interface, which incorporates capabilities from previous research such as context-specific visualization paradigms and attribute-based categorization, is built upon a highly expressive semistructured data model and data integration capabilities. In our demonstration we show how combination of a direct-manipulation-based UI paradigm and an expressive, federated data model can begin to address many of the information management problems plaguing general desktop computing today and can serve as a basis for further, yet unexplored, crossover information interaction experiments.},

Finally with our research system Human Pacman, we have a physical role-playing computer fantasy together with real human-social and mobile-gaming that emphasizes on collaboration and competition between players in a wide outdoor area that allows natural wide-area human-physical movements. Pacmen and Ghosts are now human players in the real world experiencing computer graphics fantasy-reality by using the wearable computers on them. Virtual cookies and actual tangible physical objects are incorporated into the game play to provide unique experiences of seamless transitions between real and virtual worlds.

Several different methodologies were deployed during the process. During pre launch, surveys were used to gather high-level feature preference assessments; live baseline usability testing determined areas of the flow that were difficult for users to comprehend and complete. Data from the surveys and baseline usability tests was incorporated into the redesign of the feature and page flow. Iterative prototype testing of the redesign focused on identifying major usability issues and updating the design after each round of testing to solidify and finalize the design direction. Community involvement using regular focus groups and a live, interactive preview helped inform the community and soften reaction to the change. During post launch, community feedback was leveraged to gather feedback on feature enhancements while additional rounds of iterative prototype testing tested the flow efficacy. The enhancements were presented to focus groups to ensure community needs were addressed, thus completing the usability feedback loop.},

abstract = {As world populations grow older the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementia related illnesses increases (approximately 18 million sufferers worldwide). One particularly devastating effect of AD is the loss of short-term memory, which radically impairs the sufferer's ability to communicate. People with dementia, however, often retain a facility for long-term memory that can function strongly given appropriate stimulation.Project CIRCA (Computer Interactive Reminiscence and Conversation Aid), utilizes interactive multimedia (including audio, video, animation and QuickTime VR environments) to stimulate long-term memory to prompt verbal and non-verbal communication. We will demonstrate how - through good design practice, interdisciplinary collaboration and a user-centred approach to design - we can invest reminiscence therapy with technology-led solutions to assist our participating test groups (30+ people with dementia and 40 carers) in conversational settings. We will demonstrate how this adaptable, expansive, immediate and engaging tool can contribute significantly to 'quality of life' in dementia care environments.},

abstract = {The Remail design team defined a specification for an innovative and integrated email client. This design-lead effort tackled three key problems that email researchers have discovered: lack of context, co-opting of email, and keeping track of too many things. Based on earlier design and research explorations, we conceived of a client from the ground up that attacked these problems in an integrated fashion. Our solutions were based on three constructs: showing message context, marking email, and selective display. A small team of programmers implemented much of the design in a functional prototype. This experimental client continues to allow researchers to expand and explore these concepts.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a design concept for an interactive play system and learning tool for children. The concept was illustrated with Ely the Explorer, an accessible and robust multi-user unit, set of tangible tools, and software application, designed for the school environment. This work examines the design of interfaces for co-present collaboration from an interaction design perspective. This paper also presents results from the concept evaluation in a school environment. The results showed that the system supported collaboration and interactivity and that the children enjoyed, and were engaged in the play. This indicates to us that the concept can make a positive contribution to the existing array of learning tools.},

It was designed to investigate our ideas about how technologies for the home could support ludic activities-that is, activities motivated by curiosity, exploration, and reflection rather than externally-defined tasks. The many design choices we made, for example to block or disguise utilitarian functionality, helped to articulate our emerging understanding of ludic design. Observations of the Drift Table being used in volunteers' homes over several weeks gave greater insight into how playful exploration is practically achieved and the issues involved in designing for ludic engagement.},

The old interfaces proved to be inflexible, time consuming to maintain, and could no longer meet client's needs.Therefore, the goal of our redesign project was to create a flexible interface and application framework that would improve the online catalog's user experience, mimic the client's corporate style guides to allow better integration with the client's own web properties, and provide a better approach for adding new functionality and maintaining existing awards catalog sites.},

One of the challenges facing the Acrobat 6.0 team was the legacy of the existing Acrobat 5.0 product, which had presented users with many tools and little context to explain when or how to use them. The Review and Comment feature area was a business priority for Acrobat 6.0, and a usability study on 5.0 revealed discoverability problems with the commenting tool.Acrobat 6.0 introduced task buttons that provide access to tools and instructional text relevant to accomplishing common tasks. The Review and Comment solution leverages the task button framework and proactively presents UI elements to reviewers when they need them. Iterative user feedback sessions were invaluable for identifying and resolving usability issues early in the product cycle.},

abstract = {Typing in an Indian language is currently not an easy task. Significant training is required before one can achieve an acceptable speed and only professional typists make the investment. Part of the complexity arises due to the structure of Indic scripts and large number of characters in each script. Solutions to input text in Indic languages have been around for a while, but none of these are usable enough to emerge as the de-facto standard. Here we describe the design of a new keyboard based on the structure of the Indic alphabet. The project went through cycles of design, prototyping and user evaluation. The evaluation was done by multiple techniques - usability tests, informal demonstrations, road shows and a typing competition. We particularly found the road shows and the competition useful for gathering feedback for this type of products.},

The project required an unusual amount of coordination between HI, product management, engineering, and hardware industrial design (ID) to find ways to extend digital photography conventions into the context of the Palm OS and the not very camera-like form factor of the typical Palm device. This case study shows the evolution of the camera interface over the entire development period, placing design decisions in context with larger product developments. Discovery was minimal, user testing nonexistent, and there are no published results. In other words, this case study describes how an elegant human interface design gets created under real (i.e. unreasonable) deadlines and with typical (i.e. nonexistent) resources.},

abstract = {As telecom service providers struggle under the financial pressures associated with the continuing sluggish economy, plans to trim operational expenses and grow margins have been fundamental parts of their business models. Key among these expense-cutting efforts has been the redirection of cost-intensive customer services communications to significantly less-costly web site portal interactions, such as online bill presentment and payment web services. However, the telecom industry survey results showed that expense savings and competitive differentiation should not be the only reason for developing these web services in order to ensure high use rate of these eServices [1]. These web services should be developed to enhance customer experience with these services. This paper presents how the user experience engineering techniques and usability test results were applied to redesign online bill presentment application to ensure the high rate of positive customer experience, and high percentage of use and adoption of these eServices. The online bill presentment application, one of eServices, has been developed for AT&amp;T's business customers.},

abstract = {Affective computer systems which recognize human emotions or use emotion in their displays have potential to enhance human-computer interaction (HCI). Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) methods and experimental design have enabled recording, analysis and comparison of emotional interaction of participants with an apparently 'emotional' machine and a standard 'non-emotional' version. Early results suggest participants use subtle emotional displays during HCI, for example through posture, body movement, sounds and facial expression. Further analysis will confirm if they show more emotion when they believe the system recognises their emotions, or when the system varies its behaviour in response to their emotional expression. This will contribute to HCI knowledge of affective computing by emphasizing the user's perspective, demonstrating the usefulness of WOZ techniques, and raising questions about future directions of affective computing.},

The barriers were investigated from design consultancies, manufacturers and retailers, using a variety of methods such as interview, observation, survey and case studies. Three different types of barriers were identified, namely: perception barriers, technical barriers and organizational barriers. A toolkit has been developed to address the barriers identified and is undergoing industry testing. The initial test results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the toolkit as a technical communication vehicle for inclusive design.},

Depending on group norms, this individual use of technology signals a particular social message and has implications for how the group interacts. Community is used as the measure of interest because of its relationship with other variables such as social trust, decision-making ability, and learning.},

The design of the HCI components of VRMath was influenced by educational semiotics [2, 5], which connect mathematical meanings with multiple semiotic resources. The evaluation, which involved six children, focused on both the design of VRMath and the learning within VRMath. Many new ways about thinking and doing 3D geometry and issues about the usability of VRMath were identified during the evaluation. These have implications for learning within and design of VRLEs.},

Advances in user experience through good design or improvements in usability in many products have been tarnished by forms of online advertising that have become increasingly annoying to users. Since advertising is often the primary source of revenue for many products, user experience design and research teams have had to accept online advertising as a "design constraint," with little influence on the advertising format selected. Here, we describe the emergence of a new user experience research role and our ongoing effort at Yahoo! to understand the nature and negative impacts of online advertising on user experience, with the goal of feeding this knowledge into the decision making process for ad formats, ad characteristics, and where ads are best placed within the Yahoo! network.},

Previous work on privacy has argued that users want feedback and control over such ethical choices. In response, we develop ethical contracts from the theory of contractualism, which grounds moral decisions on mutual agreement. Current findings indicate that users report significantly more respect for privacy in systems with an ethical contract when compared to a control.},

The challenge then is to enable web designers to create on-line, linked Webs based on moving gestures and signs without the need to use static image or text-based equivalents. We have developed a mechanism, signlinks, that facilitates the development of such Webs, without requiring any degree of bilingualism with a written language for the user.

Recently, metrics for assessing thoroughness, validity, and effectiveness of UEMs, based on user data, have been proposed to bridge this gap. This paper reports our findings of applying these proposed metrics in a study that compared heuristic evaluation (HE) to HE-Plus (an extended version of HE). Our experiment showed better overlap among the HE-Plus evaluators than the HE evaluators, demonstrating greater reliability of the method. When evaluation data, from testing the usability of the same website, was used in calculating the UEM performance metrics, HE-Plus was found to be a superior method to HE in all assessment criteria with a 17%, 39%, and 67% improvement in the aspects of thoroughness, validity, and effectiveness, respectively. The paper concludes with a discussion concerning the limitations of the effectiveness of the UEM from which the real users' data was obtained.},

Feet are used in many real world tasks together with the rest of the body, but in computer environments they are almost completely put aside as an interaction possibility. One of the major problems in choosing input methods for different tasks in user interfaces is determining what kind of method is appropriate for a certain task. Feet could easily be used as a supportive input method in interaction with computers together with the traditional mouse. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using foot input in different non-accurate spatial tasks, and the efficiency and usability experience the users have of foot interaction compared with a traditional hand-based interface with the same input device. The aim is to find out how well foot interaction suits for non-accurate spatial tasks.},

The results both support and contradict the notion of "banner blindness," the idea that people ignore banner ads. Participants could not recall the ads that they saw, but those ads did distract the users and significantly increased search times. The most surprising result is that recall was especially bad for animated banners. This paper examines issues of attentional capture in an applied domain and provides guidance for web designers.},

abstract = {Weblogs (or blogs) are frequently updated webpages with posts typically in reverse-chronological order. Blogging is the latest form of online communication to gain widespread popularity and it is rapidly becoming mainstream. Media attention tends to focus on "heavy-hitting" blogs devoted to politics, punditry and technology, but it has recently become apparent that vast majority of blogs are written by ordinary people for much smaller audiences, and on largely personal themes. Surprisingly little is known about this "blogging by the rest of us", especially from the blogger's point of view. This paper presents the preliminary results of an ethnographic study of blogging as a form of personal expression and communication. We characterize a number of blogging practices, and then consider blogging as personal journaling. We find blogging to be a surprisingly versatile medium, with uses similar to an online diary, personal chronicle or newsletter, and much more. The next few years should provide a fascinating opportunity for research and design as blogging tools improve and blog usage evolves and flourishes.},

abstract = {In a study of home-healthcare practitioners, we found that temporal trends contained in patients' clinical records form one of the most critical pieces of information when selecting and administering appropriate treatment. However, these records are comprised of quantitative and qualitative data, and recorded as a narrative. This format makes the extraction of historical trends difficult and time-consuming. To address this limitation, we introduce CareView, a system that utilizes a set of visualization techniques to increase the visibility of temporal trends in clinical narratives. Specifically, our system focuses on integrated temporal visualizations of numeric and qualitative records; a visualization to facilitate rapid comparison of a patient's condition against previously established care goals; and the ability to immediately visualize data as it is entered. Two experiments comparing the market-leading tabular interface with CareView revealed a significant reduction in the time required to identify trends in patients' conditions. However, interviews with nurses highlighted the importance of preserving the integrity of the holistic narrative and suggested extending the design space.},

We evaluate this commonsense approach against traditional statistical methods, demonstrating comparable performance, and suggest that combining commonsense and statistical approaches could achieve superior performance. Mobile device implementations of the commonsense predictive typing aid demonstrate that such a system could be applied to just about any computing environment.},

In interfaces that provide expert advice, one key problem is elicitation - how to ask questions that enable the expert model to make decisions, and at the same time, are understandable to the novice. The second problem is explanation - how to explain rationale behind expert decisions in terms that the user can understand. Many programs already encode expert models, but few have good models of novice knowledge, especially where broad knowledge of everyday life might bear on the subject. OMCSNet, a semantic network representation of the OpenMind Common Sense Knowledge Base, is the source of a wide range of facts about day-to-day life. CSI maps the user's goals, expressed in concepts from OMCSNet, to the expert's goals, expressed in technical financial terms. Instead of asking "What is your tolerance for risk?" where the user might not understand the concept of risk tolerance, we can ask, "Do you usually have a lot of credit card debt?" Aligning the expert's questions and decisions with common sense knowledge pertinent to the user increases the user's confidence in the ability of the system to meet their needs.},

First, using a multimedia conference system, we record conference data including time-series records of the participants' heart rates. By observing and analyzing the conference data, we assess the "resonance" phenomenon among the talkers. Using the "resonance correlation matrix", a newly proposed index based on the correlation of the heart rate data, conference participative state can be successfully estimated.},

In team-based war games, it can have a negative effect both on learning and coordination, but in race games, where individual rather than teams compete, it appears generally not to matter. In contrast, the impact of not knowing who is talking on social interaction is the same regardless of game type: while the social experience can be highly enjoyable, it is difficult for gamers to get to know each other.

abstract = {Key concerns of automobile interface designers are driving performance and safety. As cars include voices for telematics, command and control, warning messages, etc., these voices become an opportunity to affect drivers and their performance. In this experimental study, participants (N=36) spent 20 minutes in a driving simulator. The car presented randomly interspersed warnings about the driver's performance while they were driving. There were three conditions: Driver blame (e.g., "You are driving too fast"), Driver and Car blame ("We are driving too fast"), or Environment blame ("The road is easy to handle at low speeds"). Results indicate that warnings associated with the environment works best. Drivers felt most at-ease, they liked the system, they rated the quality of the car higher, and their measured attention to the road was better than the other conditions. Implications for in-car interaction systems are discussed.},

Music listening, as compared to using PDA without listening to music, prompted higher overall user satisfaction and immersion in media use, less boredom and more pleasure, and higher perceived social richness of the medium in terms of personality, liveliness, and emotionality. It was also found that PDA user experience and personality (i.e., impulsive-sensation seeking [ImpSS]) moderated some of these responses. The results are of importance given that the modern technology make it possible (1) to use computers in various everyday environments (e.g., in cafeterias and on business trips), and (2) to adapt the information and/or interfaces to fit the individual characteristics of the user.},

We present results from a questionnaire-based study, which focused on how email users dealt with messages that relate to future tasks or events. We identified two types of user, defined by how they dealt with such messages: the cleaners and the keepers. The difference between these two groups can be attributed to differences in email experience and requirements for flexibility of closure. The ultimate goal of such research is to be able to predict differences in email use and to inform email user interface design and we discuss possible ways in which this could be done.},

abstract = {In this study, alternative methods for studying legibility of text while walking with a mobile phone were examined. Normal reading and pseudo-text search were used as visual tasks in four walking conditions. Visual performance and subjective evaluation of task difficulty were used as measures of text legibility. According to the results, visual performance suffers from increasing walking speed, and the effects are greater on reading velocity for pseudo-text search. Subjects also use more homogenous strategies when reading compared to pseudo-text search, and therefore it is concluded that reading is a more useful measure of legibility. Subjective measures are found to be more sensitive to small variations in legibility than objective measures, and give additional information about task demands. Hence, without both objective and subjective measurements important information about legibility in different conditions and with different tasks will be lost.},

We present two experiments to examine the benefits of target expansion during an eye-controlled selection task. The second experiment also tested the efficiency of a "grab-and-hold algorithm" to counteract inherent eye jitter. Results confirm the benefits of target expansion both in pointing speed and accuracy. Additionally, the grab-and-hold algorithm affords a dramatic 57% reduction in error rates overall. The reduction is as much as 68% for targets subtending 0.35 degrees of visual angle. However, there is a cost which surfaces as a slight increase in movement time (10%). These findings indicate that target expansion coupled with additional measures to accommodate eye jitter has the potential to make eye gaze a more suitable input modality.},

Participants saw significantly greater value in the multimodal interaction, and rated their experience with the multimodal system significantly more positively than the unimodal system. They were also significantly more inclined to use and recommend the multimodal system over the current unimodal product offering.

In this paper we describe an approach for dynamically restructuring user interfaces into a set of communicating processes that 1) provide methods for changing their appearance, behavior, and state; and 2) report their proposed state changes so that other processes may override their actions in updating themselves to a new state. We do this for both new and wrapped legacy user interface components, thereby allowing us to repurpose user interfaces for our evolving needs.

abstract = {The term immersion is widely used to describe games but it is not clear what immersion is or indeed if people are using the same word consistently. This paper describes work done to define immersion based on the experiences of gamers. Grounded Theory is used to construct a robust division of immersion into the three levels: engagement, engrossment and total immersion. This division alone suggests new lines for investigating immersion and transferring it into software domains other than games.},

These principles include persistent tools that embody intuitive aspects of their physical counterparts and an approach to interface learnability that capitalizes on the user's inherent ability to use tools both separately and in conjunction with other tools. In addition to these principles, the DiamondTouch variation of HabilisDraw (HabilisDraw DT) extends the physical-virtual tool correlation with bimanual input via the MERL DiamondTouch input device and a close adherence to the direct manipulation interaction model. This paper presents the HabilisDraw interface, explores the benefits of a desktop metaphor that closely mimics the behavior of two-dimensional tools and objects in a drawing environment, and argues for the applicability of the system's fundamental principles for improving interface usability in the future.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the concept of shape-changing, user interface control devices called "Haptic Chameleon", which refers to computer-controlled user interface devices that convey information to and from the user by altering their shape and feel. The user decides what a Haptic Chameleon control will do by changing its shape, and can immediately recognize the capabilities of the newly shaped device through haptic and tactile channels. By combining the benefits of tangible and haptic user interfaces, this new user interface paradigm has the potential to vastly improve the learning and efficiency of interaction in a wide range of applications. It also represents an appealing alternative to current control devices. We report on our experience with early prototypes based on this concept, discuss open issues, and propose possible directions for future work.},

As touch is a powerful signal for emotional content, haptic signals, and especially hapticons can contribute to overcome the inevi-table loss of subtle non-verbal communication cues. Audio-visual extensions of IM to share emotions, in particular emoticons, have been received enthusiastically by IM users. This indicates a realistic user-need for hapticons in IM.The Haptic Instant Messaging (HIM) framework introduced in this paper combines communication of textual messages with haptic effects and hapticons. The application is build as an open framework and supports small chatting communities to explore the design and use of hapticons and haptic IO devices. Researchers can use the HIM framework to monitor the use of haptics in communication and how haptics contribute to the fun and meaning of instant messaging.},

Their resolution using context and a priori knowledge has been investigated in the fields of natural language and speech understanding. However, there are utterances that cannot be understood by such symbol processing alone. In this paper, we consider inexplicit utterances caused from the fact that humans have vision. If we are certain that the listeners share some visual information, we often omit or mention ambiguously things about it in our utterances. We propose a method of understanding speech with such ambiguities using computer vision. It tracks the human's gaze direction, detecting objects in the direction. It also recognizes the human's actions. Based on these bits of visual information, it understands the human's inexplicit utterances. Experimental results show that the method helps to realize human-friendly speech interfaces.},

The flexibility they offer results in an increased complexity that current software development tools do not address appropriately. In this paper we describe a component-based approach, called ICARE, for specifying and developing multimodal interfaces. Our approach relies on two types of components: (i) elementary components that describe pure modalities and (ii) composition components (Complementarity, Redundancy and Equivalence) that enable the designer to specify combined usage of modalities. The designer graphically assembles the ICARE components and the code of the multimodal user interface is automatically generated. Although the ICARE platform is not fully developed, we illustrate the applicability of the approach with the implementation of two multimodal systems: MEMO a GeoNote system and MID, a multimodal identification interface.},

While online inquiry includes many different activities (e.g., planning, information seeking, synthesis), this paper focuses on supporting learners with information analysis so they can effectively read and make sense of articles they find in digital libraries. Here we spotlight scaffolded notepads, which connect to articles learners are reading in a browser. Notepads support learners by connecting their goals to their reading, guiding reflection and articulation, and implementing a framework by which learners' notes and articles are linked, saved and viewed together to aid with more seamless information management.},

Demand is growing to be able to effectively archive meetings and teleconferences to facilitate human communication. Conventional systems use fixed-viewpoint cameras and simple camera selection based on participants' utterances etc. However, these systems fail to convey a sufficient amount of nonverbal information about the participants and the flow of conversation. On the basis of participants' gaze behavior in multiparty conversation, we propose a new video cut editing rule; the rule uses majority decision with regard to participants' gaze direction. We then present experiments that compare the proposed method to conventional visual representations. We conclude that the proposed method can more successfully convey 1) who is talking to whom and 2) hearers' response to speakers, which are extremely crucial pieces of information that allow viewers to understand the flow of conversation.},

abstract = {The objective of this preliminary study is to investigate whether educational video games can be integrated into a classroom with positive effects for the teacher and students. The challenges faced when introducing a video game into a classroom are twofold: overcoming the notion that a "toy" does not belong in the school and developing software that has real educational value while stimulating the learner. We conducted an initial pilot study with 39 second grade students using our mathematic drill software Skills Arena. Early data from the pilot suggests that not only do teachers and students enjoy using Skills Arena, students have exceeded our expectations by doing three times more math problems in 19 days than they would have using traditional worksheets. Based on this encouraging qualitative study, future work that focuses on quantitative benefits should likely uncover additional positive results.},

People often describe tangible user interfaces as "more intuitive" interfaces because we have learned how to manipulate physical objects throughout our lifetime. However, after almost 10 years of prototype development and numerous conference papers, tangible user interfaces have had minimal impact on everyday use of computers. Is there anything that prevents tangible user interfaces from becoming more widely used? In order to investigate the effect of tangible user interfaces, we designed a spatial task to compare a paper tangible user interface with a mouse-controlled graphical user interface. Using a within-subjects design, data were collected from 12 subjects who used both interfaces. Results indicated that subjects exhibited better performance (center displacement error and reproduction time) with the paper tangible user interface.},

abstract = {Level of Web experience is often a factor for which researchers attempt to control while conducting experimental studies on Web usability. It is typically measured by some means of self-assessment that often includes questions regarding long-term usage, frequency of use, and the types of activities performed while using the Web. A common assumption is that Web experience is the same as Web expertise (high experience = high expertise). In our research studies primarily focused on Web usability and older adults, we found that even when Web experience is controlled, older adults still demonstrated less Web expertise than younger adults. Our research has supported the hypothesis that Web expertise is significantly influenced by how users learned the Web - or their cumulative time spent in collaborative learning environments (learning from and with others) - rather than just how long or how often they have used it. Preliminary results in our labs demonstrate a positive correlation between opportunities for collaborative learning and Web expertise, as well as a negative correlation between opportunities for collaborative learning and age. These results support the need to reassess how best to measure Web expertise and how we might improve Web interaction for older adults.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel way to enhance input devices to sense a user's foot motion. By measuring the electrostatic potential of a user, this device can sense the user's footsteps and jumps without requiring any external sensors such as a floor mat or sensors embedded in shoes. We apply this sensing principle to the gamepad to explore a new class of game interactions that combine the player's physical motion with gamepad manipulations. We also discuss other possible in-put devices that can be enhanced by the proposed sensing architecture such as a portable music player that can sense foot motion through the headphone and musical instruments that can be affected by the players' motion.},

The surface of the pressure-sensitive pad is logically divided into four linear strips which simulate traditional interaction metaphors and the functions of which may be modified dynamically under software control. No homing of the hand or fingers in needed once the fingers are placed above their corresponding strips. We show how the number of strips on the pad can be virtually extended from four to fourteen by detecting contact pressure differences and dual-finger motions. Due to the compact size of the device and the method of interaction, which does not rely on on-screen widgets or the 2D navigation of a cursor, the versatile input system may be used in applications, where it is advantageous to minimize the amount of visual feedback required for interaction.},

We draw three lessons from There for the design of games and virtual environments: that text chat can be better integrated into the virtual environment, that gestures are valuable as communication topics as well as resources, and that social interactions can improve the social presence felt in virtual environments.},

Results show that a more difficult task demands longer processing time, induces higher subjective ratings of mental workload, and reliably evokes greater pupillary response at salient subtasks.

We find that - for practical considerations of design and implementation - transactions can be represented as balanced exchanges in the context of a trust relationship. We've proposed that such exchanges become trusted - and that trust must be accommodated - through at least three characteristics of social systems as applied to transactions: accountability, real-time inspectability and the capacity to exercise recourse. In this paper, we extend further recent work on designing for accountability (Eriks\'{e}n, 2002). We suggest that ubiquitous computing technologies applied to transactions in general and, retail transactions more specifically, need to explicitly consider these characteristics in their design to support trusted, balanced exchanges.},

Connecting our users with concepts in a graphical manner, icons cross cultural and language barriers. With eBay's expansion into international countries and the growing complexity of the site, requests for icon creation have increased exponentially. To address the challenge of maintaining consistency in the face of an abundance of icons and the many purposes that they serve, we conducted a series of studies. How does one present the variety of icons and accommodate all their different functions, and still maintain simplicity and consistency? Recognizing the need to create a consistent icon experience, eBay conducted two usability studies to research icon usage. We sought to answer the following 2 questions: 1) How does an icon's design affect its affordance and comprehension? 2) How many icons can we present before reaching a saturation point?},

abstract = {The documents users must handle are growing both in number and diversity. However, the ways of organizing and retrieving them remain largely unchanged. Given the innate human ability to tell stories, the use of narratives can be a natural and effective way to retrieve documents. To better understand how narratives can be used in this context, a thorough characterization of their contents and structure was obtained from several interviews. Then, the results were validated by the evaluation of low fidelity prototypes for story-capture interfaces, allowing us to verify that stories are valid as document-retrieval tools, and the shape those interfaces should take (structured text entry).},

abstract = {Compare to searching online information directly, asking friends or finding referral to a human expert is preferred in many information-gathering tasks. It's easier to judge the quality of the information from a personal referral as well as to obtain information that is not publicly published [1]. Instant Messaging (IM) has potentials to effectively support such social network based information seeking [3], which are not fully explored other than providing better communications. For instance, a user usually does not know what his friends' friends know. If none of his friends in his IM buddy list knows the sought information, he either gives up this search method or needs intensive personal helps from a friend who transfers questions and answers in between.Previous studies indicated that it is feasible to add social network search functionalities to IM systems. Watts et al. [2] found that social networks have the surprising property of being searchable. Systems such as ReferralWeb [1], show that it is possible to mine people's social relationships and information identities from electronic resources and use them for referral or matchmaker purposes. Based on these ideas, we designed and implemented the Small World Instant Messenger (SWIM).},

abstract = {Issues surrounding human computer interaction apply to all domains where humans interact with a software or a hardware system through a computer controlled interface. It is important that an interface presents a consistent system that matches the operator's goals and understanding, and this importance grows when rapid decisions and actions are required to maintain a desired level of productivity and/or safety. Driving is a domain where split second responses are the norm; this implies that interfaces which require high-level cognitive responses are often undesirable because such responses are often much too slow. In the design of driver support systems, safety is always the primary constraint that permeates all design decisions independent of whether the goal is to improve driving performance, enhance comfort, reduce fatigue, or free up attentional resources to better manage and enjoy telematics services. In the panel discussion at CHI2004, a panel of experts from varied backgrounds is challenged to design joystick control for a passenger car in order to expose the CHI community to the multi-facetted structure of issues that arise when technological and human constraints define the boundary of design possibilities.},

Particularly in the design and management of ubiquitous computing and mobile communication environments embodying the concept of ambient intelligence, understanding diverse and changing contexts of people's life and work and incorporation of an accommodating context-sensitivity into the system need to be pursued. This SIG attempts to introduce a representation framework for contextual information critical to develop a methodological foundation for user-centered design practice. First, the concept of context is discussed including questions such as what composes a context, how contexts are structured and assessed, and how they can be described in relation to interactive systems development. Then, strategies and methods to incorporate context sensitivity are discussed from the perspective of system development in relation to types of system architecture that can effectively implement context-sensitivity.},

Some are little more than electronic versions of paper-based materials; others attempt to replicate a traditional classroom offering; while others follow an instructional design approach used for classroom instruction. As a result, the reputation of online courses is not good and the exception, rather than the rule, is a well-designed course that effectively teaches a topic to its target students.In this Special Interest Group (SIG), we will look at one aspect of eLearning: making online courses engaging and fun. "Fun and pleasure are elusive concepts" [1] and there is no consensus on how to design enjoyable experiences [2]. Engagement is accepted as important in online learning but is similarly elusive. We will look at how courses can be designed to increase enjoyment; if fun can increase motivation, engagement, and retention; how multimedia, games, entertainment, and fun are related; and the impact of peers, instructors, mentors, and support staff on fun with respect to the learning experience.},

abstract = {Is it possible to bring the benefits of rigorous software engineering methodologies to end users? End users create software when they use spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools and graphical languages, when they write educational simulations, spreadsheets, and dynamic e-business web applications. Unfortunately, however, errors are pervasive in end-user software, and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous. A growing number of researchers and developers are working on ways to make the software created by end-users more reliable. This special interest group meeting will help start to form a community of researchers who are addressing this topic.},

This has been largely possible through the efforts of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the development of Web standards and guidelines that promote the creation of content, authoring tools and user agents that are accessible. Given that the Web and related technologies are a dynamic proving ground for user interface research, ensuring that these new developments are usable to the widest possible audience can be a challenge, to both the research community and the end-user. The W3C WAI Research and Development Interest Group (RDIG) was chartered to examine emerging, web related technologies, still in the research stage and, through a series of virtual workshops, explore how accessibility can be incorporated at an early stage to ensure all users can benefit from promising developments, (e.g., technologies coming from the area of ubiquitous computing or multimodality).This SIG will examine the progress of RDIG and encourage discussion by interested CHI researchers on the role of accessibility in their work.},

The use of such techniques has been required in order to increase the bandwidth between the users and the systems and thus to help them deal efficiently to increasingly complex systems. These techniques come from research and innovation done in the field of HCI but very little has been done to improve their reliability and their tolerance to human error. It can be difficult to know how to assess the risks that such systems can create for the successful operation of safety-critical systems. One consequence of this is that interaction issues are almost entirely missing from international development standards in safety-critical systems, such as IEC615098 or DO 178B.

The system consists of a booklet with a game description, voting rules and a rotating disk, which employs RFID technology and an integrated sensor. To vote, the spectator turns the wheel to set the score and then via a send button transmits it to receivers placed at strategic positions from which a central computer collects the data, sums it up and calculates the results. These results are subsequently displayed on a big screen next to the judges' results.

abstract = {In recent years the Olympic Games have undergone vast criticism due to perceived subjective scoring in judged events, as for example figure skating and gymnastics. Judges' scores may be influenced by favoritism, human error, or possibly corruption. Audience participation in scoring represents a promising approach to meet these problems. In this paper we present an audience voting system that utilizes the natural behavior of sports spectators: clapping and cheering. The system consists of wireless motion sensors and microphones that enable spectators to cast their vote in real time. The sensors are worn by audience members and determine the clapping frequency of each participant. This facilitates continuous influence on the score throughout an athlete's performance. The audience score is presented on wall-sized stadium displays and might be contrasted with the judges' scores to encourage audience engagement.},

The stage for this participation will be the diving and gymnastics events at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens. We researched the Olympic audience and studied collaborative group interaction. This process made us realize that a traditional, quantitative scoring system would not adequately address the needs of an international Olympic audience. Our solution is the Global Garden, a wearable interface that defies the conventional process of entering a "score" and displaying it. It consists of a set of interactive devices worn on the hand that glow green when a user claps, and changes colors based on different hand gestures that follow. By using applause, the intuitive and international sign of appreciation, the audience itself becomes an interface. People provide the input and output of a universal "score," heightening everyone's desires to participate and eliminating the need for excessive infrastructure. We achieved our goals to design a novel, intuitive (instruction-less) interaction that connects members of the audience to the events they watch and to each other.},

The devices are simple to use, come in multiple designs, and are tradable. These devices do not hold any personal information so privacy is never an issue. The vote results are presented on a large public display, which is loaded with information in the form of graphs that are quickly understood. People can retrieve their personal votes later on the Internet. The system was designed through a process involving brainstorming, creating scenarios, searching for information, doing cognitive walkthroughs, developing prototypes, and revising and refining ideas.},

abstract = {Konekt is an interactive voting system that allows audience members that are physically present at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics to judge and score the athletes during the gymnastics and diving competitions. The goal of the system is to connect audience members to each other through judging to facilitate human-to-human interactions. A handheld device allows all members of the audience to score athletes performances without competing with the technical scorings done by the Olympic judges. We explain how the team gained a holistic understanding of different issues that needed to be addressed by conducting interviews with experts in the sports, attending sporting events, and various other methods of immersing ourselves in the problem. Two key findings included difficulty by audience members to notice nuances in the performance and how to seamlessly integrate this system for this particular Olympics. We explain how we generated multiple iterations of possible solutions to this problem and then consolidated those concepts into our final solution. The final design is a screen based hand held device that has an animated character derived from the existing mascot for the Athens Olympics. It guides the user through the judging process and introduces them to a giant screen in the stadium that displays the results. When the device is carried throughout the stadium it allows people to connect to other people who had similar voting patterns.},

abstract = {In an effort to address the contentious issue of judged Olympic events, the Olympic committee has proposed a pilot audience participation system to score the gymnastics and diving competitions in the upcoming 2004 Athens Summer Games. The system would allow the spectators who are physically present at the event to cast their vote in real time. The spectator vote will have no effect on an athlete's official score and will be purely for entertainment purposes. Enabling audience members to voice their opinions electronically creates an emotionally exciting new form of spectator involvement within the Olympics. Our system relies on the principle of judging the judges, allowing spectators to agree or disagree with a score given to an athlete by the Olympic panel of judges. The spectator participates in the unique experience of being able to voice their opinion on a larger scale. After the event, the spectator has a keepsake that they can treasure for years after the Athens Games.},

Much effort has been put in to making this solution realistic, cost efficient, innovative and simple. The audience can use this system to vote on an athlete's performance by simply holding up a coloured page from the athletic event program. To further enhance the experience of visiting the Olympic Games another new feature is introduced, which gives the audience all information about what the professional judges thought about the performance by presenting it visually directly in the replay. The origin of this project was based on the criticism that some Olympic events have received in previous years for challengeable judgment. By focusing on information flow and understandability, the design team has proposed a flexible, versatile and relatively low-cost solution.},

The design challenge posed was to pilot audience participation as a way to reduce the controversy caused by judging at the Olympics in sports such as diving and gymnastics. We faced this challenge by applying both empirical and analytical human-computer interaction methods, as well as extensive research into the Olympics and available technologies. Our findings led us to suggest the "Shake It!" system for Athens 2004: Each spectator will have a shaker that divides into two parts, each part having a different color and producing a different sound. Audience members use the shaker to express agreement or disagreement with the judge's scores. A computer vision system will be used to process the input, and audience member votes will be represented on a large screen in the venue.},

abstract = {Continuous controversy surrounding the judging of events during the Olympic Games incites the need for a system of audience participation in scoring. In this way the audience votes could theoretically be considered by the judges. In this pilot proposal the audience vote will initially be offered purely as a form of entertainment and a means to increase audience participation. Judging, be it by a professional or an amateur prospector seems to suffer from idiosyncrasies (bias). In the design of a new flexible and highly usable system for collecting spectators' scores, this problem is embraced instead of denied. Without harming the spontaneous reaction and appreciation of the international audience for an athlete, the designed sound &amp; motion (SoMo) system takes the normal response (clapping, cheering, and waving) of an audience and translates this into a vote.},

The system provides a simple and portable system that can be used for any sporting event where judge scores are reviewed by an audience. The supporting database design provides for statistical analysis and portability as well by providing a generalized database structure that can be easily adapted to any event as necessary. By using off-the-shelf technologies and open-source software, the solution provides for simple implementation, inexpensive hardware requirements, and easy software development.},

Aside from completing CHI's primary goal of creating a voting device, we found that audience members need a knowledge base and a feeling of empowerment in order to feel secure with their vote. Based on fieldwork with past and potential Olympic attendees, we focused on wearable technology that senses pre-existing methods of showing appreciation and translates audience enthusiasm into an opportunity for learning and empowerment. Building from previous research, we implemented a unique method of creating a system for audience participation that requires no training or learning curve on behalf of its user. These methods were then tested and refined until they were well received by a large majority of users regardless of age, gender and nationality. In our paper we describe our process through an explanation of our immersion in the project, its early ideation, testing and refinement, and our final solution.},

abstract = {The goal of this workshop is to explore and support the design of temporal aspects of interactive systems. Time design is an emerging research and development domain that emphasizes the functional, causal role of time in human-device interaction. It draws on a diverse literature on time in cognitive psychology, psychophysics, sociology, computer science, engineering, Human Factors and HCI. Contributions from each of these disciplines are invited so that preliminary design recommendations can be distilled and an interdisciplinary research agenda can be defined. The discussion will be centered around several scenarios that highlight the temporal characteristics and requirements of different application domains.},

A necessity for this promise is the adoption of products and services to the profiles of their users. A possible concern for end users is the large number and wide variety of different products and services to deal with. In this workshop we will discuss the width and depth of the topic of profiling and will try to come to requirements and recommendations from an end user perspective.},
