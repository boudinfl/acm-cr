abstract = {We present TactileVR, an immersive presence and tactile feedback into virtual reality. Our system allows users free to move around and interact with physical objects and toys, which co-exist in the virtual world. By integrating tracking information from the space as well as head, hands and feet of the user, we represent this information as virtual proxies in the 3D environment. Each object has a unique appearance and behavior e.g. in an electric circuits lab toy blocks serve as switches, batteries and light bulbs. By tracking and integrating toys and other everyday objects into VR, we are able to create educational and recreational experiences for children, an environment in which they can play and learn more autonomously.},

The fantasy that any of us could have superhero powers has always inspired people around the world. By using Virtual Reality and real-time brain activity sensing we are moving one step closer to making this dream real. We non-invasively monitor and record electrical activity of the brain and incorporate this data in the VR experience using an Oculus Rift and the MUSE headband. By sensing brain waves using a series of EEG sensors, the level of activity is fed back to the user via 3D content in the virtual environment. When the user is focused they are able to make changes in the 3D environment and control their powers. Our system increases mindfulness and helps achieve higher levels of concentration while entertaining the user.},

abstract = {Manipulating a virtual object with appropriate passive haptic cues provides a satisfying sense of presence in virtual reality. However, scaling such experiences to support multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one needs to be accompanied with a precisely-located haptic proxy object. We showcase a solution that overcomes this limitation by hacking human perception. Our framework for repurposing passive haptics, called haptic retargeting, leverages the dominance of vision when our senses conflict. With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics for multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically aligning physical and virtual objects: body manipulation, world manipulation and a hybrid technique which combines both world and body warping. This video accompanies our CHI paper.},

This disease affects the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in charge of movement, balance and body coordination. As the disease evolves, people with ARSACS need more ergonomic products to maintain a certain level of autonomy. With an ethnographic approach, we observed that in addition to not fulfilling the needs of people with ARSACS, these expansive ergonomic products are not aesthetically pleasing and therefore negatively influence the self-image of their users who apprehend and feel the look of others upon them. In collaboration with occupational therapists and designers, we are now introducing EMIE, a digital service used to design and print -- in 3D -- personalized ergonomic products that meet the needs of people with ARSACS, in hopes of building a community. This service will both raise the self-image of people with ARSACS and foster their autonomy and social insertion.},

In addition, we also realized that visually impaired people can take good care of themselves and their clothes, all they need is an easy approach to recognize their clothes. Accordingly, to achieve our goal, we designed a complete clothing label system along with some related products. The key design of our system is the tactile clothing labels, which can be either made by users or provided by clothing stores. With the labels, users can easily gain information of each article of clothing by themselves, making many tasks about clothes be done more efficiently.},

The research has shown that the average distance between passengers and bus is 10 to 15 meters in approximation caused by imprecision of bus stopping, therefore the scenery which passengers with lower mobility unable to get on bus smoothly is not uncommon. As one of the potential solutions to the above issue, our research team has designed a new system named "BringUBus", which generates a designated parking spot for drivers to respect, thus being notified to stop right in front of the passengers with lower mobility. Eventually improves the bus-taking experience of those in need and promotes the completeness of accessible environment.},

abstract = {EDGE is an accessible text-input overlay on touch screen phones that is designed specifically to enable speedier typing by users with vision impairment. The model uses the edges of the phone because all the tactile references available on a touch screen are concentrated along the edges. The characters are laid out along the edges in the same grouping as a 3x4 International Standard Key Pad, building on users' familiarity [1]. It can be initiated in the same manner as any keyboard service on a smart phone. However, it occupies the full extent of the screen as an overlay and can be dismissed by an on-screen gesture. The model has the ability to switch between single-tap and multi-tap mode and features that provide context awareness while typing. Along with text prediction as an added feature, EDGE could be a very effective text input method that visually impaired users will be able to use with confidence even without audio feedback.},

Some people with extreme fear of public speaking will avoid it at all costs, even if it means their personal, professional, and social growth may be hindered. AwareMe incorporates aspects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and good public speaking practices to make an empowering assistive technology for people who suffer from different levels of public speaking anxiety. AwareMe is a device that provides feedback on voice pitch, filler words, and words per minute during presentation practice. It has a detachable wristband, worn during presentations, that provides visual and haptic feedback. Our approach differs from existing solutions because it focuses on bringing the users' attention to how their anxiety influences their speech patterns; this awareness helps them to directly improve their public speaking skills.},

abstract = {Interactive training environments typically include feedback mechanisms designed to help trainees improve their performance through guided or self-reflection. When the training system deals with human-to-human communications, as one would find in a teacher, counselor or cross-cultural trainer, such feedback needs to focus on all aspects of human communication. This means that, in addition to verbal communication, nonverbal messages (kinesics in particular) must be captured and analyzed for semantic meaning. The goal of this research is to introduce interactive training models developed to improve human-to-human interaction. The specific context in which we prototype and validate these models is the TeachLivE teacher rehearsal environment developed at the University of Central Florida. We implemented an online gesture recognition application on top of the Microsoft Kinect software development kit with multiple feedback channels including visual and haptics. In a study of twelve participants rehearsing a teaching session in TeachLivE, we found that the online gesture recognition tool and its associated feedback method are effective and non-intrusive approaches for the purpose of communication-skill training. The algorithms employed, the results, and the implications for other interactive contexts are discussed in this paper.},

I propose formal and scalable methods towards thematic classification, annotion and interlinking for these texts; this is done at various levels of granulartiy that existing research fails to address. I apply a 'semantics driven learnersourcing' methodology, which leverages primarily upon students engaging in typical knowledge seeking and learning scenarios, and embeds within them, semantic annotation tasks. The chosen method also ensures annotation reliability by introducing an 'expert sourcing' workflow tightly integrated within the system. Therefore, quantitative measures of ensuring annotation quality are woven into the very fabric of learnersourcing.},

abstract = {Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is one of the most effective ways to input text, in particular, for ultra-small devices such as smartwatches. Although the accuracy of ASR has been improving these days, it still often makes recognition errors. If you want to correct words that have been recognized incorrectly, you need to use a software keyboard or read out the words again. However, it is difficult and annoying to input text correctly using a software keyboard on a small display. Besides, even if you read out the same phrase again, there is no guarantee that your speech will be recognized correctly. To address this problem, we designed a custom phonetic alphabet optimal for ASR. It enables the user to input words more accurately than spelling them out directly or using the NATO phonetic alphabet, which is known as the standardized phonetic alphabet used for human-human speech interaction under noise. Furthermore, we conducted user studies to verify our method's efficiency in correcting speech recognition errors on a small display.},

To explore this, a home tour interview was conducted where participants were asked to select an object that reminded them of a loved one. Through thematic analysis of responses, it became clear that sound recordings could be a useful tool that allow people to reminisce. These findings led to the development of the Memory Tree prototype that aimed to find out how people use sound to reminisce. Three people were asked to interact with the prototype. Results showed that the Memory Tree successfully facilitated reminiscing, both in the recording and playback stages, even if participants did not identify sound as the memory cue.},

There was a significant difference in response time, with older participants requiring longer time to respond. Although no significant differences were found for eye glance duration towards the map, there were significant differences for the number of eye glances toward the maps with older participants glancing at the maps twice as often as younger participants. Younger participants had significantly longer glance durations towards the driving scene. It is suggested that the higher number of glances reflects the older participants' need to retain the information in working memory. This proves useful in better understanding the cognitive and visual processes of older drivers while reading digital maps.},

Crowdsourcing provides a potential solution because with appropriate methods, humans are often more effective at synthesizing diverse information than automated techniques. This paper introduces Crowdnection, which leverages crowdsourcing methods to examine the effect of amount of context on performance in making connections between raw texts of historical textual documents and high-level concepts. The results suggest novices are able to help process information to provide meaningful insights, and indicate that there is an ideal amount of context facilitating the sensemaking process.},

Charades is a good example, where one player tries to express a word via body language, and the other tries to guess it. We have designed Human and Dog, in which 2 players, a human and a dog, have their unique capabilities to acquire clues and cooperate to solve a series of puzzles.},

abstract = {Bad News is a game about death notification that combines deep simulation and live performance. After discovering a dead body, the player is tasked with tracking down a next of kin to inform him or her of the death. To do this, the player must discover the identities of both the deceased and next of kin, as well as the current location of the latter. Gameplay is underpinned by a rich simulation of a generic small town inhabited by several hundred non-player characters (NPCs) who build up subjective knowledge of one another as the simulation proceeds. The player interface is serviced by Wizard-of-Oz techniques, and the core gameplay interaction is embodied conversation with live-acted NPCs. Stationed out of sight from the player, a 'wizard' executes his or her commands (as they are spoken aloud) by live-coding modifications to the simulation. When the player encounters an NPC, an actor reveals himself to perform the character live. Crucially, the actor's improvisation is constrained to the underlying simulation--particularly the personality, life history, and knowledge of the character he is portraying--which is expressed to him via a discreet interface.},

abstract = {Many factors contribute to people's physical inactivity, but among the leading factors is a lack of motivation. Fitness trackers have been shown to encourage an increase in exercise, but they are frequently abandoned within a few short months. We developed our asynchronous-play social gaming platform, FitPlay Games, to fill the gap in motivation left by current fitness trackers. By providing users with a variety of asynchronous cooperative and competitive gaming styles, we enable them to find a motivation technique that works best for their lifestyle and fitness prowess. The platform encourages prolonged use of fitness trackers, helping users to have more healthy lifestyles. Individual games are designed to allow both the novice and the maven to have a chance at winning, leveling the playing field, and increasing motivation to win. The effectiveness, usability, and enjoyability of the social games will be assessed, with an emphasis on understanding differences in play habits due to gender and lifestyle.},

abstract = {Generic multi-button controllers are the most common input devices used for video games. In contrast, dedicated game controllers and gestural interactions increase immersion and playability. Room-sized gaming opens up possibilities to further enhance the immersive experience, and provides players with opportunities to use full-body movements as input. We present a purpose-centric approach to appropriating everyday objects as physical game controllers, for immersive room-sized gaming. Virtual manipulations supported by such physical controllers mimic real-world function and usage. As a proof-of-concept, we present a 'Tower Defense' styled game, that uses four everyday household objects as game controllers, each of which serves as a weapon to defend the base of the players from enemy bots. Players are provided with: 1) a broom to sweep away enemy bots directionally; 2) a fan to scatter them away; 3) a vacuum cleaner to suck them; 4) a mouse trap to destroy them. Each controller is tracked using a motion capture system. A physics engine is integrated in the game and ensures virtual objects act as if they are manipulated by the actual physical controller, thus providing players with an immersive gaming experience.},

abstract = {Pain is both a universal and unique experience for its sufferers. Nonetheless, pain is also invisible and incommunicable that it becomes difficult for the public to understand or even believe the suffering, especially for the persistent form of pain: Chronic Pain. Therefore, we designed and developed the game -- AS IF -- to foster non-patients' empathy for Chronic Pain sufferers. In this game, players engage with the connecting dots tasks through whole body interaction. After they generate the connection with their virtual body, they will experience a certain degree of activity limitation that mimics one of the sufferings of Chronic Pain. In this paper, we introduce the game design that facilitates the enhancement of empathy for Chronic Pain experience, and illustrate how this game acts as a form of communication media that may help to enhance understanding.},

During gameplay, we scan the environment in real-time and build a virtual voxel world. We spawn virtual objects in the voxel world, and allow simple hand and leg interactions. The tablet is mounted on the user's head using the Durovis Dive headset so that the user can see the world in VR. All this is done in ~60 fps for user comfort. With this approach, we have created a fully immersive, untethered experience where players can freely walk around large spaces in the real world and avoid obstacles, while interacting with a virtual environment.},

So, instead of the current social network trend reinforcing people using technology to create a "virtual social life" avoiding the physicality, we believe technology itself can be used to manage this techno-social dilemma, completing the technological infrastructure proposed for smart cities.

abstract = {Digital games are a major part of the global economy, and participation in gaming cultures can lead to informal learning in computer science and technology. However, recent news stories highlight the often toxic attitudes that gamers have towards marginalized populations participating in, and having a voice regarding game culture. A valuable lens into game culture that may help us to understand its operations is in an increasingly popular practice: streaming gameplay for others on platforms like Twitch.tv. My dissertation aims to understand the performance of play using mixed methodologies, informed by a sociological approach called field analysis. The proposed research aims to understand the performance of play in terms of the individual, the spaces that support the practice, and the relations of power within the wider economic field of digital games.},

My dissertation research is in how to increase opportunities for children with mixed abilities to equally, actively, and meaningfully participate in the same setting with the assistance of interactive technology. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the ability of interactive technology to support children and their adult guardians with inclusive play, or play among children with different abilities and needs. My research adds to the growing movement within HCI toward a social model of disability, and I hope to inspire future technology design based on inclusive principles and the empowerment of all children.},

Now that both tools and people's skills have changed, how are people actually using these new tools in their collaborations? In my dissertation project, I investigate how people write together now, using both qualitative (i.e., interviewing participants and hand-coding co-authored documents) and quantitative (i.e., statistical modeling using Google Docs log data) research methods. I have also built information visualization systems to complement existing research methods. By understanding what practices and tools people use in collaborative writing, I will propose design implications for system designers to improve the tools, as well as collaboration guidelines for people to write together better.},

Biofeedback process is a highly individual experience in the way the users respond to the feedback and use it to regulate their thoughts and physiology. This research explores a novel adaptive biofeedback system for mind-body practices. The proposed biofeedback system could adapt its feedback source, information load and interface modality based on the user's physiological states, achieved performance and interaction. The adaptive biofeedback system is currently being developed and a longitudinal evaluation will be conducted in the future.},

An observer is a sculptural scenic presence, vaguely anthropomorphic, equipped with a camera, that analyses the movements of the users, and creates a soundscape. The observers are movable but not mobile, meaning that their placement on stage defines a set of overlapping layers of activation for the users to interact with. This work aims to answer questions on what scenic subjects emerge from interacting with the observers, what new identities and relationships are established, and how we can use emotional and scenic components of these relationships to find new expressive qualities in stage productions.},

This interactive installation addresses spatial and social connectedness, stressing the importance of integrating architectural and spatial features to support complex social dynamics in mediated interaction. The tool engages users in manipulating their real-time video- streams, creatively co-designing a shared mediated space that fits a contextual need. It supports social dynamics by allowing users to draw and paint together and to move and resize video streams. Further, it enhances grounding and social cues by merging video- streams and space, representing users as if they were in the same space. Standard and easily available equipment is used. Recent user studies show that a seamless integration of space, social dynamics and shared activity benefits the experience of presence, naturalness, immersion/engagement and social connectedness.},

The relationship model of parent and child is used as an analogy for the relationship between the performer and their mobile device. This model of parent and child is used in order to propose the design of mobile device accessories that maintain and enhance this relationship. The performance also proposes a form of wearable technology that maintains relationships with mobile devices as we lose our distance to them as they migrate onto and into our bodies.},

Therefore, the tactile display must be transparent so that it does not obstruct the view of the screen. On the other hand, if the tactile sensation is presented at the back of the device, the tactile display does not need to be transparent. However, tactile presentation to the whole palm of hand is not appropriate while a shape on the screen is touched by only one finger. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a new novel to present tactile feedback to a finger on the back. Electro-tactile display is used because it is small and dense. The tactile display presents touch sensation as a mirror of shape on the screen.},

The functionality and design of the installation are based on the findings of neuroscientific research and the distribution of cultural probes. The neuroscientific research encompassed the exploration of two parts in the brain, the amygdala and the hippocampus, that cooperate when processing fear reactions. The acquired knowledge about these processes in the brain that is active when encountering fear enabled us to make informed decisions during the design process. Additionally, the cultural probes provided new insights about different fears and the content for the installation. The goal of the audiovisual installation is to give people more insight into the subject of fear, by offering them an interactive experience that is based on the archiving and retrieving of emotions and sounds related to fear.},

abstract = {Against the backdrop of the current debate about HCI's relationship with science and its ways to produce and argue for knowledge, this paper seeks to develop a novel philosophical foundation that rests on the central ideas put forward in critical realism. While it affords many of the features of the post-modern theories that shaped modern HCI, critical realism avoids the danger of slipping into extreme relativism, in which knowledge construction becomes arbitrary and isolated in its context. Moreover, critical realism is inherently multi-faceted and provides a basis on which scientific enquiries of very different natures can be treated complementary rather than as competing with each other. This allows us to develop a non-reductionist view on interaction with technology that accommodates and potentially reconciles the variety of approaches, practices and stances that we see in current HCI.},

abstract = {The paper discusses some of the key HCI studies dealing with mortality and death and concludes that the overall research perspective, adopted in most of the studies -- namely, conducting empirical analyses of user practices and trying to improve the practices through iterative cycles of design and evaluation -- is not fully appropriate for understanding the impact of technology on how people experience their own mortality. The paper discusses an alternative research perspective, existential HCI, and argues that adopting that perspective can usefully complement existing studies related to mortality and death. A tentative analysis of "digital afterlife", understood as the persistence of a person's digital possessions and traces beyond the person's life span, from an existential HCI perspective, is presented. Prospects and challenges for future development of an existential perspective in HCI research are discussed.},

The factor that differentiates and distinguishes design fiction from other approaches is its novel use of world building and in this paper we consider whether there is value in creating fictional research worlds through which we might consider future interactions. As an example we build a world in which algorithms for detecting empathy will become a major compnent of future communications. We take inspiration from the sci-fi film Blade Runner in order to consider what a plausible world, in which it is useful to build a Voight-Kampff machine, might be like.},

The paper will describe our initial investigations into the topic, which have mostly focused on searching for 3D printable materials that can serve as effective substrates for plant growth. We will also discuss the potential utility of printable gardens particularly for dense, urban centers, and how the concept may be viewed as an initial step towards fabrication of more complex, holistic natural environments i.e., printable nature.},

This paper argues for a let-it-lie approach where a new class of applications might be "applied" to the information in situ through an API supported by its hosting application or service.

abstract = {In the 10 years since the term was coined 'design fiction' has become an increasingly common approach in HCI research. The practice involves working with 'diegetic prototypes', that is prototypes that need not exist in reality, but instead exist from within a 'story world'. Although fictional aspects are not unusual in HCI prototyping methods (e.g. storyboards, personas, Wizard-of-Oz), the breadth and flexibility of design fiction poses new challenges. This paper originally featured quotes from peer reviews of design fiction orientated papers that have previously been submitted to ACM SIGCHI conferences in order to highlight inherent challenges when reviewing research that may be based upon or include elements of fiction. In response to the SIGCHI Executive Committee's request to not directly quote reviewers the quotes have now been redacted. This somewhat changes the paper's tone and also makes very clear that publishing discussions relating to peer reviews (or the reviews themselves) is extremely challenging.},

abstract = {Peer-review is key to assessing work in HCI conferences. The content and process of peer-review, and how it moves scholarship forward or impedes it, are much discussed but little data is available. We provide initial data from surveying 46 authors who submitted papers and notes to CHI 2016, and asking them what they found helpful and unhelpful in their reviews. Responses were overall positive, and showed that authors appreciated encouragement, ideas for related work, and seeing their work fairly assessed. At the same time, some authors commented that reviews may not be inclusive of new approaches, may contain insufficient details, and occasionally seem unreasonable. They also noted issues specific to the rebuttal process. We discuss how instructions for reviewers could be improved, and link our findings to ongoing debates on peer review.},

However, the current authorship model -- i.e., placing authors' names in a particular order -- makes the contributions of collaborators who are not the "first author" (or not mentioned) less visible which negatively affects career paths. Still, if smaller and larger contributions are equally rewarded with a "good" position in the author list, a researcher's achievements may be overrated. We suggest a solution with interactive technology to highlight contributions. The benefits include high visibility of contributions, in-situ access to in-depth researcher profiles, in situ access to similar work by the contributors, and low incentive for artificial credits.},

Over the past few years, we have tried everything from writing guidelines and giving accessibility feedback, to enforcing accessibility standards and volunteering to make PDFs accessible ourselves. The problem with making PDFs accessible is in part due to the lack of good tools, but the complexity of the PDF format makes improving tools difficult. Making accessible research papers is as much about our choices as a community: our choice of publication format, and our choice to make accessibility a voluntary task for authors. In this paper, we overview the context in which PDFs became our publication format, the difficulty in making PDF documents accessible given current tools, what we have tried to make our PDFs more accessible, and potential options for doing better in the future.},

For the purpose of understanding how to better design language learning video games that appeal to a diverse group of students, we examine female college students' gameplay experiences in a conversation-based Spanish language learning video game. Student evaluations reveal that the majority of students had a positive gameplay experience. However, students criticized the game for its lack of diversity, including lack of diverse game characters, missed opportunities to integrate aspects of Spanish culture into game tasks and the inability to customize the gameplay experience. Qualitative analysis of students' suggestions provide insights into designing inclusive gaming environments that promote language learning.},

abstract = {Within industrial domains there is a need for control room operators to be in constant contact with the different processes they are responsible for controlling. With this responsibility comes the need to constantly be near their workstations in order to monitor, diagnose and quickly troubleshoot issues presented. These workstations, however, restrict operators in control rooms from moving freely within the control room itself, such as between their own and their colleague's workstations since they cannot interact with the system from a distance. These systems also restrict those operators who need to continuously enter the control room from the plant/factory floor since interacting with process graphics requires them to remove all of their specialized equipment every time (e.g. large bulky safety gloves). We therefore present a concept for control room operators that supports their untethering from dedicated workstations, providing them with the ability to interact in a more flexible way.},

abstract = {Ocean salinity is a critical component to understanding climate change. Salinity concentrations and temperature drive large ocean currents which in turn drive global weather patterns. Melting ice caps lower salinity at the poles while river deltas bring fresh water into the ocean worldwide. These processes slow ocean currents, changing weather patterns and producing extreme climate events which disproportionally affect those living in poverty. Analysis of salinity presents a unique visualization challenge. Important data are found in narrow data ranges, varying with global location. Changing values of salinity are important in understanding ocean currents, but are difficult to map to colors using traditional tools. Commonly used colormaps may not provide sufficient detail for this data. Current editing tools do not easily enable a scientist to explore the subtleties of salinity. We present a workflow, enabled by an interactive colormap tool that allows a scientist to interactively apply sophisticated colormaps to scalar data. The intuitive and immediate interaction of the scientist with the data is a critical contribution of this work.},

The objective was to support the design of a commercial ultra-low cost smartphone would appeal to the user experience of the mass. We were a team of HCI researchers started by devising a formal method to segment the vast and varied user group in order to undertake field study. We were faced with challenges ranging from diverse expectations of users, their varied levels of technology exposure and the means to map their perceived experience to our design ideas. Our contribution was in the critical insights, which we gathered through our field research. These insights helped define the final product which was ultimately commercially launched with differentiating regional user experience.},

abstract = {Gathering data about the emotional journey of a product and user experience is on the forefront of both user and customer experience, but the question remains: What is the best way to do this? There are sloughs of solutions that claim to capture the user's emotions in various ways: via biometrics, facial analysis, vocal analysis, and more. While some of these solutions can provide you with seemingly accurate feedback, they can also be intrusive. Other solutions can be expensive, leaving a start up or other lean UX team struggling to find these answers. This case study follows UEGroup's approach to tackle the issues surrounding capturing the emotional experience of a product, with a focus on an agile self-reporting method. In this case study we attempt to answer the question- is self-reporting more or less effective than these other emotion capturing methods?},

abstract = {Usability testing has long been considered a gold standard in evaluating the ease of use of software and websites-producing metrics to benchmark the experience and identifying areas for improvement. However, logistical complexities and costs can make frequent usability testing infeasible. Alternatives to usability testing include various forms of expert reviews that identify usability problems but fail to provide task performance metrics. This case study describes a method by which multiple teams of trained evaluators generated task usability ratings and compared them to metrics collected from an independently run usability test on three software products. Although inter-rater reliability ranged from modest to strong and the correlation between actual and predicted metrics did establish fair concurrent validity, opportunities for improved reliability and validity were identified. By establishing clear guidelines, this method can provide a useful usability rating for a range of products across multiple platforms, without costing significant time or money.},

abstract = {Personal fabrication is an emerging research field in Human Computer Interaction and related disciplines. Within the last three years, an increasing number of papers have been published that branch out into different research directions. To maximize the impact HCI researchers can have on this emerging field, it is important to identify the grand challenges and then approach them in a focused way. In order to understand what trajectory fabrication can be expected to follow, we analyze state-of-the-art research and draw an analogy to similar trends we have seen in the history of personal computing. As a result, we identified five challenges for fabrication research: (1) material, (2) interactivity, (3) domain knowledge, (4) sustainability, and (5) intellectual property. At the end of the course, participants will have an in-depth understanding of state of the art research in personal fabrication and will be aware of open research question in the field that they might want to tackle in their future research.},

abstract = {There is a new urgency to measure subtle age-related cognitive dysfunction with discoveries that amyloid pathology afflicts the brain 20 years before Alzheimer's dementia and more recently that drug infusions can reduce amyloid. Measuring mental processes in controlled laboratory environments has yielded rich insights; however, there is a growing awareness of the importance of complimenting this work with study in real life contexts to understand everyday functioning. In fact the diagnosis of dementia is critically dependent on the measure of functional decline and clinicians have long struggled to define this effectively. This course will be an introduction to the current state of clinical diagnosis of age-related cognitive declines and dementia with the goal of facilitating effective collaboration between computer scientists and clinicians to help older adults. The following topics will be covered. How do we define dysfunctional cognition and dementia clinically? How does a clinician approach diagnosis and what are the major types of dementia and age-related cognitive disorders defined? What is a clinical measure and how do we develop them? How are clinical measures used? What are the major research directions ongoing to treat and prevent age-related declines (e.g. brain stimulation, exercise, medications, diet)? What are some key ethical issues that clinicians consider in working the novel technologies?},

abstract = {Introduction to visual facilitation for design groups, enables leaders to catalyze innovation in groups by (1) aggregating ideas creatively in a visual tableau (2) activating human-system elements of design through somatic expression, (3) enabling multiple cognitive inputs, (4) modeling the fundamentals of innovation such as risk-taking, open-ended inquiry, vulnerability, and pattern-finding. This is a highly experiential course, based on the cognitive apprenticeship approach to learning. Participants will work on large paper altogether and in small groups. Human factors are increasingly complex in computer-human interaction. Effectiveness depends on the ability of designers to reach a diverse audience, including cognitive diversity. Design teams often are facing this challenge by including greater diversity in their groups. But to succeed, they must learn to leverage multiple perspectives, and enable team members to stretch their thinking, transcending unconscious biases and the limits of their own training and experience. To accomplish this requires techniques that support people of different personality traits, cultural backgrounds, and cognitive attributes to express their best ideas in an environment that is interpersonally supportive as well as intellectually rigorous. Visual facilitation enables this through: (1) The use of free-hand, simple imagery that expresses the essence of ideas before they are fully formed. The imperfect nature of a quick visual conveys that ideas are in process rather than fully-formed. This encourages the sharing of emerging concepts so that collaboration can occur earlier in the design process. (2) Methods that enable people to contribute their ideas multiple ways that allow full expression for diverse personality and cultural styles. (3) At the meta-level, the deeply human and ancient practice of communicating visually creates a design atmosphere likely to produce more human-friendly products.},

abstract = {Apps are changing the world. If you work for a bank, an airline, an art gallery or a even a local coffee shop, you'll probably have helped create an app to connect and transact with your customers and visitors. As users, we consume these bite-sized chunks of digital goodness voraciously, with some estimates putting total app downloads to date at over 100 billion. People find apps effective, satisfying and enjoyable. Meeting their needs, filling dead time, solving their problems. So, why are we organising a course that argues for some new thinking? We celebrate the success that is apps, services and the ecology of mobile devices; but, we want to ask the question: what do the current approaches to mobile interaction overlook? Is there more to user experience than can be expressed through today's heads-down, glass blunted and me-centred reality? We have both have had the great fortune to work and collaborate with research labs, practitioners and industry. The aim of this course is to connect the great app innovation that is out there with the sorts of alternative thinking that have been brewing in university and industry labs for several years. It seems obvious how things should develop in the mobile market-more apps, better screens, longer battery life, faster and faster networks, drawing us more and more towards the tempting pool that leads us to digital worlds that offer so much. We want to help undermine this certainty by challenging attendees to step back and look at alternative perspectives; changing the future but starting now.},

abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness. The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

This course explores the ways in which home entertainment systems benefit from such technological advances, in the quest to design highly-interactive smart home entertainment spaces. Attendees will be introduced to the fundamental principles of smart spaces and ambient intelligence, augmented reality, and gesture interface design by falling back on examples of designs and applications for home entertainment. Notions such as context awareness, mixed reality, and naturalness of gesture interaction will be clarified for participants in the context of home entertainment. Practical aspects of augmented reality and gesture sensing and recognition technology will be explained and accompanied by examples from research and industry. It is the my hope that this course will prove a valuable source of inspiration for practitioners interested in prototyping novel, highly-interactive smart spaces toward designing our future home entertainment experience.},

abstract = {In this enhanced version of our well-received tutorial in NordiCHI'14 we will teach the way we design UIs at Reaktor and share our lessons learned from more than 10 years of design in agile projects. No previous knowledge of UI design is required, but the participants should know at least the basics of agile development in order to follow the examples and discussion in the second part. The course has two parts: First we will teach how to create straightforward UI designs in a systematical fashion. This part focuses on demos and hands-on exercises with a minimal amount of theory, talk and slides. It is based on the GUIDe method and UI design courses that have been taught to hundreds of students at the University of Helsinki and developed further at Reaktor. In the second part we will present our current state of the art in combining design activities (conceptual design, UI design, graphics design, ...) with agile development. In the past 10 years, we have tried out many different approaches. We will show practical examples of real projects with their results and illustrate, what practices worked, what did not and why. This part is an interactive lesson -- the participants are most welcome to ask a lot of questions during the session. The instructors are all designers at Reaktor, a Finland-based software consultancy with offices in New York, Tokyo and Helsinki. Most of them have been teaching at University of Helsinki, Dept. of Computer Science. Today, they make sure that the software built at Reaktor solves meaningful and financially viable problems. In practice, they find out what parts of the users' work would benefit most of software support and draw straightforward UI solutions for them.},

Now companies are investing resources to "fill the pipeline." While this is needed, it alone won't solve the diversity or gender challenge. Once they're in the workplace, research shows that women leave tech careers at a much higher rate than their male counterparts. While there are many reasons for this phenomenon, research indicates that daily workplace factors, along with the realities of what women want for their lives, contribute most significantly to women leaving tech careers. HCI is also affected by this phenomenon and the CHI community has been tackling the issue in several different ways. A panel of HCI professionals from different backgrounds will share personal insights, react to the research on challenges, suggest solutions, and solicit perspectives from the audience.},

Automation has already been studied in a number of (sub-) disciplines and application fields: design, human factors, psychology, (software) engineering, aviation, health care, games. One distinguishing feature of the area we are focusing on is that in the field of interactive critical systems properties such as reliability, dependability, fault-tolerance are as important as usability, user experience or overall acceptance issues. The SIG targets at two problem areas: first the engineering of the user interaction with (partly-) autonomous systems: how to design, build and assess autonomous behavior, especially in cases where there is a need to represent on the user interface both autonomous and interactive objects. An example of such integration is the representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (where no direct interaction is possible), together with aircrafts (that have to be instructed by an air traffic controller to avoid the UAV). Second the design and engineering of user interaction in general for autonomous objects/systems (for example a cruise control in a car or an autopilot in an aircraft).},

Many companies recognize they must diversify their workforce and have taken significant steps to recruit underrepresented populations. However, once inside the organization these groups continue to face challenges not encountered by White or Asian male counterparts. Now companies must understand and address the experiences of daily life for underrepresented groups so they stay, advance, and thrive. This SIG creates a forum for participants to discuss diversity issues, share experiences, and identify potential solutions. To frame the dialog, the SIG organizers will also share their findings from their initial field research and survey into this area.

Given the increase in quantity and variety of submissions, and the involvement and engagement of practitioners within the community, it is important for the community to have this SIG as a forum. We plan to give a brief overview of the history of game research at CHI as well as its current state. Then, we want to engage the community in a discussion about the scope that games research at CHI should have and where we want to take this community from here. We want to vibrantly explore new outlets for academic dissemination, community outreach, and collaborations with practitioners.},

abstract = {This SIG advances the study of mobile user interfaces for the aging population. The topic is timely, as the mobile device has become the most widely used computer terminal and at the same time the number of older people will soon exceed the number of children worldwide. However, most HCI research addresses younger adults and has had little impact on older adults. Some design trends, like the mantra "smaller is smarter", contradict the needs of older users. Developments like this may diminish their ability to access information and participate in society. This can lead to further isolation (social and physical) of older adults and increased widening of the digital divide. This SIG aims to discuss mobile interfaces for older adults. The SIG has three goals: (i) to map the state-of-art, (ii) to build a community gathering experts from related areas, and (iii) to raise awareness within the SIGCHI community.

To overcome this, we designed LockDoll, a tangible artifact that provides ambient feedback of smartphone usage to help members manage their usage. By following an ambient design pattern of symbolic sculptural display, we expect LockDoll to softly and yet, effectively intervene with smartphone usage in the group context.

abstract = {Plagiarism in online learning environments has a detrimental effect on the trust of online courses and their viability. Automatic plagiarism detection systems do exist yet the specific situation in online courses restricts their use. To allow for easy automated grading, online assignments usually are less open and instead require students to fill in small gaps. Therefore solutions tend to be very similar, yet are then not necessarily plagiarized. In this paper we propose a new approach to detect code re-use that increases the prediction accuracy by dynamically removing parts in assignments which are part of almost every assignment--the so called common ground. Our approach shows significantly better F-measure and Cohen's Kappa results than other state of the art algorithms such as Moss or JPlag. The proposed method is also language agnostic to the point that training and test data sets can be taken from different programming languages.},

abstract = {Shared Interactive Surfaces allow co-located users to collaboratively work on a task. As current technology often is not able to distinguish between different users, there is a potential for concurrent conflicting actions of multiple users, leading to unwanted results and accordingly frustration. With our concepts for Task-Based Focus and AdHoc-Focus-Territory we provide light-weight solutions Integrated in our toolkit TUIOFX - for designers of multi-user, multi-touch applications. Our solution helps to overcome some of the problems of anonymous touch input, without an immediate need for more heavy-weight mechanisms like user identification.},

However its main populations have been faculty, teachers, high school or college students, and its primary context has been a course or classroom.

Based on the survey responses from 91 current Ph.D. students, our study results highlight that (1) students mainly use social media for broadcasting and keeping up with up-to-date academic and research information; yet, making connections and developing professional networks is one of the primary reasons, and (2) social media use is positively associated with their academic engagement and satisfaction. We discuss implications and future work of our study.},

Many times, on such social media platforms people are also interested to see and analyze the connections not only with their connected people but also the connections between these connected people (called the ego network of a user). Hereby they want to find out different behavioral patterns and interesting findings. In this work, we introduce our developed visualization tool, called PerSoN-Vis (Personal Social Network Visualizer). It visualizes intuitively people ego-networks and enables them to explore interactively their social contacts and the relations between these contacts. Further, it allows them to filter the resulting visualization based on several collected features. A preliminary evaluation study shows that participants performed much better in our PerSoN-Vis tool compared to Socialab social-network visualization tool.},

We introduce HandVis, a video conferencing interface that visualizes elements of hand gesture, such as trajectory and amount. Gesture is intended to be a communicative tool that can compensate for language deficits. The results of a user study indicate how HandVis can be utilized constructively by less-proficient speakers during cross-lingual communication.},

In two online experiments, we find that team dating affects the way that people select partners and how they evaluate them. We use these results to draw useful conclusions for the future of team dating and its implications for collaborative crowdsourcing.},

With this paper, we investigate -- through crowdsourcing -- the gap between children and crowdsourcing. To gather a diverse sample of participants we used CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing platform, to generate, evaluate and rank ideas and concepts. Results show that 93% of parents and 80% of non-parents would involve children in crowdsourcing. The most valued concept of the crowd was the collaboration between parents and children, who are innovating for companies. This concept involves publishing companies requesting drawings from children for book illustrations.},

Using the system, a local user can send their information and a view of their environment to a remote helper who can send back visual cues on the local user's see-through display to help them perform a real world task. A pilot user study was conducted to explore how effective the Empathy Glasses were at supporting remote collaboration. We describe the implications that can be drawn from this user study.},

An unexplored area in this domain was the development of a content optimization technique for smaller, editorially-focused sites that creates a long-term brand value that inspires visitors to engage with websites. The results of a study on 276 online articles and associated web metrics show that images within an article, the number of times visitors viewed an article and if they reached the article through a search engine were significant positive predictors of the time they spent with articles. However, the percentage of single-page visits to an article and the number of times visitors clicked a link outside of an article were significant negative predictors for the time they spent with articles. These factors were utilized to develop a statistical rank for content optimization, which shows some initial promising results.},

abstract = {Software development is often accompanied by security audits such as penetration tests, usually performed on behalf of the software vendor. In penetration tests security experts identify entry points for attacks in a software product. Many development teams undergo such audits for the first time if their product is attacked or faces new security concerns. The audits often serve as an eye-opener for development teams: they realize that security requires much more attention. However, there is a lack of clarity with regard to what lasting benefits developers can reap from penetration tests. We report from a one-year study of a penetration test run at a major software vendor, and describe how a software development team managed to incorporate the test findings. Results suggest that penetration tests improve developers' security awareness, but that long-lasting enhancements of development practices are hampered by a lack of dedicated security stakeholders and if security is not properly reflected in the communicative and collaborative structures of the organization.},

abstract = {Due to the consistent growing number of tourists around the world and the increasing use of online services to plan trips, this paper investigates the group tourists' trip planning requirements and how technology might support this group planning process. We investigated 12 groups' real trip planning behaviour and requirements through a diary study and a follow-up interview. The experiment was designed and analysed based on Activity Theory, a theoretical construct commonly applied in human computer interaction (HCI) and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). From our preliminary findings, we report group's trip planning requirements in three aspects: division of labour &amp; information search, intra-group communication, and culture difference (i.e., Chinese users' characteristics). To facilitate group tourists' planning experience, this paper concludes HCI design implications from three perspectives: tourism information presentation, facilitating intra-group communication, and requirements from Chinese users.},

abstract = {Users of online dating systems want to evaluate each other to predict who they will be attracted to in-person. Prior research into evaluation of online dating profiles has shown how users struggle to evaluate physical attractiveness and demographic traits because of deception. Yet we have little knowledge about successful user evaluation strategies, or evaluation of other traits known to influence attraction like personality. We addressed these gaps in knowledge through an interview study of professional online dating coaches (n=27) to extract their self-proclaimed successful user evaluation strategies for 3 categories of traits derived from attraction literature: physical appearance, demographics &amp; values, and personality. We then interpreted these strategies through the lens of theories germane to attraction--Nisbett and Wilson's theory of introspection, Asch's theory of person perception, and Signaling theory.},

Novel cartographic and technological solutions are therefore presented, which address exploration using digital maps in the context of location based gaming and tourism. These examples demonstrate the potential of digital cartography to influence behavior and the importance of aesthetics in the cartographic process.},

In this paper we argue that, in many scenarios, designing friction into interactions through the introduction of microboundaries, can, in fact, have positive effects. Design frictions can disrupt "mindless" automatic interactions, prompting moments of reflection and more "mindful" interaction. The potential advantages of intentionally introduced frictions are numerous: from reducing the likelihood of errors in data-entry tasks, to supporting health-behaviour change.},

abstract = {The use of films in early stages of the design of technology is a practice that is becoming increasingly common. However, the focus of these films is usually centered on exploring the technology and its specifications rather than on the experiences that the technology can potentially create for its user. Previous research emphasises the relevance of experiences created by the technology in the users arguing that the emotions should be taken into account during early design stages and made part of the design itself. In this paper we provide a step-by-step production pipeline on how to make your own design fiction film, and how you can get the experiences across. For this purpose we focus on the experiences and emotions that a specific interaction medium elicits. We gained inspiration from the increased exploration of olfactory experiences in HCI. We used a classification of smell experiences as a starting point to produce a design fiction film for the automotive context, not limited by technology but inspired by experiences.},

Our approach finds a parametrization that optimally resolves conflicts among competing interpretations of a layout. The output is a hierarchical grouping of main elements.

Participants used three distinct strategies for embodiment of emotion through shape: the look of a shape (visual representation), creation of a shape symbolizing the experience of an intended emotion (metaphor), and by evoking the intended emotion in the creator through affective movements and manipulations during construction (motion). This work ties together and extends understanding around emotion and form in HCI subdomains such as tangible embodied interaction, emotional assessment, and user experience evaluation.},

Our main findings from the design exploration are: 1) users are engaged in the interaction with an interactive agent even though the agent is not perceived as engaged by the user; 2) users are more involved in the experience when the agent is interactive; and 3) the agent's gaze is effective in grabbing the user's attention. These findings provide initial insights on designing for engagement in displays that make use of embodied agents and should be validated with a field study.},

abstract = {Poor Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) in office environments leads to worker discomfort and lost productivity. This paper provides a unique perspective into the specifically social determinants of IEQ in naturally ventilated offices and our work toward designing technology that might improve it. Based on 15 qualitative interviews we explore the rituals, practices and negotiations involved in opening windows and thermostat adjustment. We find that a wish to maintain status quo results in workers putting up with discomfort with IEQ factors well before requesting a change. In closing, we introduce our future design work aimed at drawing attention to existing office practices and encouraging a broader participation in negotiations around IEQ factors in the workplace.},

abstract = {Analyzing affective studies is challenging because they feature multimodal data, such as psychometric scores, imaging sequences, and signals from wearable sensors, with the latter streaming continuously for hours on end. Meaningful visual representations of such data can greatly facilitate insights and qualitative analysis. Various tools that were proposed to tackle this problem provide visualizations of the original data only; they do not support higher level abstractions. In this paper, we introduce SubjectBook, an interactive web-based tool for synchronizing, visualizing, exploring, and analyzing affective datasets. Uniquely, SubjectBook operates at three levels of abstraction, mirroring the stages of quantitative analysis in hypothesis-driven research. The top level uses a grid visualization to show the study's significant outcomes across subjects. The middle level summarizes, for each subject, context information along with the explanatory and response measurements in a construct reminiscent of an ID card. This enables the analyst to appreciate within subject phenomena. Finally, the bottom level brings together detailed information concerning the inner and outer state of human subjects along with their real-world interactions - a visualization fusion that supports cause and effect reasoning at the experimental session level. SubjectBook was evaluated on a case study focused on driving behaviors.},

abstract = {Sketching is an integral part of a designer's creative process, especially in the early phase of a project and in particular when exploring an unfamiliar medium. Traditional design principles does not seem to apply when designing presentations for a fulldome. Surprisingly, interviews with local creative professionals revealed that sketching was a challenge when designing fulldome presentations, which made it more difficult for them to understand the characteristics of this unfamiliar medium. This challenge has also been affirmed by the first author's own experience of creating a fulldome presentation. This paper describes the challenges in designing for a fulldome and discusses the work in progress by imagining new variations of sketching media that are being created as early design concepts, which will be tried out by a reference group. The aim is to identify characteristics a sketching medium needs to have in order for a designer to successfully express and explore early ideas for a fulldome presentation.},

By applying craft-based methodology to this project, we investigated the ways in which fabricating this material with digital technologies provides innovations within the HCI community. Most importantly, we attempted to discover fabrication techniques that facilitate artistic experiences and interactions with concrete without sacrificing its existing properties.},

We explore voluntary eye convergences as a novel interaction technique for precise and accurate timing of gaze input and a solution to the 'Midas touch' problem, i.e. the accidental triggering of input when looking at an interface. We introduce a novel clock paradigm to study input timing and demonstrate that voluntary convergences are significantly more accurate and precise than common gaze dwelling. Our findings suggest that voluntary convergences are well-suited for applications in which timing of user input is important, thereby complementing existing gaze techniques that focus on speed and spatial precision.},

Most existing SCUBA diving simulations in VR are limited to visual and aural displays. We propose a virtual reality system, Amphibian that provides an immersive SCUBA diving experience through a convenient terrestrial simulator. Users lie on their torso on a motion platform with their outstretched arms and legs placed in a suspended harness. Users receive visual and aural feedback through the Oculus Rift head-mounted display and a pair of headphones. Additionally, we simulate buoyancy, drag, and temperature changes through various sensors. Preliminary deployment shows that the system has potential to offer a high degree of presence in VR.},

Instead of visualizing the collected voltages by electrodes, we calculate a current density distribution to estimate the origin of electrical source which is responsible for perceived values at electrodes. Understanding where the centers of activation in the brain are allows to better understand the relationship between external stimuli and brain activity. This could be relevant in the context of information presentation for doctors to analyze pathological phenomena. A pilot study was conducted using Virtual Reality as input stimulus. Results indicate visible changes in real-time regarding brain activation.},

abstract = {Mapping techniques from software tutorials onto physical craft processes can assist novices in building multi-material assemblies. By providing in-situ step instructions and progress tracking, generating dynamic feedback on technique, and adapting tutorial content to a user's specific context and preferences, an ecosystem of smart tools can guide users through complete project tutorials. We demonstrate how such techniques can be enabled by augmenting common workshop tools (drill/driver, saw, router) with measurement, state sensing and interactive feedback; and by sequencing instructions across multiple tools. We validate the benefits of a smart tool ecosystem through reflections on a series of author-created design examples and informal feedback from four fab lab users.},

abstract = {TV watching is a common leisure activity, and people often use the opportunity of TV watching to socialize with other co-watchers. However, when potential TV co-watchers like friends or family members are distributed in different locations, the social function of TV watching is disrupted. In this paper, we present a mobile TV content sharing system called Co-Viewing Room, which enables distributed users to share three types of TV content, including it whole video sharing, video clips sharing and it snapshots sharing during an online chat. We evaluated the system by comparing the influence of the three types of content sharing on users' experience and social interactions. Our results showed that people were satisfied with remote TV sharing support, and tended to be more responsive to lightweight shared content like snapshots and video clips. Also, people regarded snapshots sharing as a useful support for efficient social chat.},

abstract = {Entity discovery is a long-lasting interest in governments, enterprises, and the research community. It is a complex task that requires retrieving, extracting, linking, and displaying entities. Algorithms to support entity discovery have been proposed across disciplines including Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Mining (DM). However, there is little study on User Interface (UI) for supporting effective entity discovery. This paper presents Minerva II, a novel entity discovery tool, to tackle this challenge. In the paper, we illustrate the UI design and how it effectively supports the typical work flow when a user performs entity discovery. We also describe a new visualization algorithm for entity networks. Our user study shows that Minerva II is able to greatly increase users' efficiency.},

We first define a candidate movement quality conceptually, with the involvement of experts in the field (e.g., dancers, choreographers). Next, we collect a dataset of performances and we evaluate the perception of the chosen quality. Finally, we propose a computational model to detect the presence of the quality in a movement segment and we compare the outcomes of the model with the evaluation results. In the proposed on-going work, we apply this approach to a specific quality of movement: Fluidity. The proposed methods and models may have several applications, e.g., in emotion detection from full-body movement, interactive training of motor skills, rehabilitation.},

However, children with physical impairments that also have cognitive disabilities find additional difficulties in using the current GNomon-based interface. To compensate these difficulties, the "classical" GNomon widget must be rethought and simplified. This paper proposes a parallel between three different widgets specifically designed for GNomon-based interfaces. Each widget employs metaphor in a different way and it has been evaluated with six children with motor and cognitive disabilities. The results are encouraging: a widget, based on the "big and small" concept, is preferred by children and is a candidate to make single-switch games easier to approach.},

abstract = {Mind wandering (MW) is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has a negative influence on performance and productivity in many contexts. We propose that intelligent interfaces should have some mechanism to detect and respond to MW in real-time. Towards this end, we developed an interface that automatically detects MW from eye-gaze during computerized reading. When MW is detected, the interface intervenes by asking just-in-time questions and encouraging re-reading as needed. After multiple rounds of iterative refinement, we summatively compared the interface to a yoked control condition in a randomized control trial with 104 participants. Preliminary results suggest that the system was successful in correcting comprehension deficits attributed to MW, thereby highlighting the potential for intelligent interfaces that improve performance by "attending to attention."},

These hand postures comprise a system of musical notation typically used in sight-singing training to familiarize with patterns of musical tones. Therefore, what concerns us is music literacy as opposed to practice with any particular instrument. Our system uses a Leap motion sensor to recognize the hand signs and produce corresponding user-recorded sounds. For each hand sign, the system also displays a natural 3D scenery, which is intended to match the metaphorical nature of the tone and has a resemblance to the hand posture (e.g. mi is a steady or calm tone, so the hand sign is an open hand with palm downwards and the scenery is a calm but moving ocean).},

One of the most challenging tasks while interacting with large high-resolution displays is target acquisition. The most important challenges reported in previous work are the long distances that need to be traveled with the pointer while still enabling precise selection as well as seeking for the pointer on the large display. In this paper, we investigate if MAGIC-Pointing, controlling the pointer through eye gaze, can help overcome both challenges. We implemented MAGIC-Pointing for a 2.85m x 1.13m large display. Using this system we conducted a target selection study. The results show that using MAGIC-Pointing for selecting targets on wall-sized displays decreases the task completion time significantly and it also decreases the users' task load. We therefore argue that MAGIC-Pointing can help to make interaction with wall-sized displays usable.},

Our system only requires the use of two speakers and a microphone to be operational. Since these components are already built in to most end user systems, our design makes gesture-based input more accessible to a wider range of end users. By generating a known high frequency tone from multiple speakers and detecting movement using changes in the sound waves, we are able to calculate a Euclidean representation of hand velocity that is then used for more natural gesture recognition and thus, more meaningful interaction mappings. We present the results of a user study of Multiwave to evaluate recognition rates for different gestures and report accuracy rates comparable to or better than the current state of the art. We also report subjective user feedback and some lessons learned from our system that provide additional insight for future applications of multidimensional gesture recognition.},

Six solenoids were embedded along the surface of the wheel, creating three bumps under each palm. The solenoids can be used to create a range of different tactile patterns. As a result of the design recommendation by Gallace et al. [Gallace2006a] maximally four of the six solenoids were actuated simultaneously, resulting in 57 patterns to test. A simulated driving study was conducted to investigate (1) the optimal number of actuated solenoids and (2) the most perceivable haptic patterns. A relationship between number of actuated solenoids and pattern identification rate was established. Perception accuracy drops above three active solenoids. Haptic patterns mirrored symmetrically on both hands were perceived more accurately. Practical applications for displaying tactile messages on the steering wheel are e.g. dead angles, upcoming road conditions, navigation information (i.e. conveying information discretely to the driver).},

abstract = {Mid-air gestures have become an important interaction technique in natural user interfaces, especially in augmented reality and virtual reality. Supporting a set of continuous gesture-based commands in mid-air gesture interaction systems, such as selecting and moving then placing an object, however, remains to be a challenge. This is largely because these intentional command gestures are connected through transitional, meaningless gestures, which are often misleading for gesture recognition systems. The inability to separate unintentional movements from intentional command gestures, also called the Midas problem, limits the application of mid-air gestures. This paper addresses the Midas problem via a physiological computing approach. With the help of sensors that capture physiological signals, we present a novel method, Pactolus, for segmenting mid-air gestures using arm electromyography. User studies demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach in segmenting mid-air gestures interleaved by transitional hand or finger movements.},

We developed a prototype cheek haptic display that generates an air vortex ring at two types of intensity of air pressure to present a different haptic stimulus on the cheek when a subject feels stress while performing a task. Using the system, we conducted a preliminary experiment to evaluate cognitive awareness using task performance, physiological awareness using changes in autonomic activity, and subjective feelings using a visual analog scale test of three stress feelings for quantitative evaluation of emotional experience. Although further experiments are needed, the results show that it is a promising method for effectively reducing stress and modifying emotional experience.},

Our research explores the use of an interactive guided loving-kindness meditation focused on providing external visualizations. This paper describes a pilot study that sought to understand the potential for such an interactive design approach. Participants engaged with a mobile app over a week and completed both quantitative and qualitative measures. Our findings suggest that an interactive approach that uses external guided visualizations inline with traditional LKM scripts, can cultivate compassion. Yet our findings suggest the use of externalized visualizations may deter from a focus on physiological sensations accompanying internal visualizations. In addition, a mobile approach may present new opportunities to provide situated forms of extending ones contemplative practice into everyday life through reminders and notifications.},

However, emotion is primarily conveyed through visual signals, and so this research aims to support the design of emotional visual feedback. We adapt and extend the design of the "pulsing amoeba" [29], and measure the emotion conveyed through the abstract visual designs. It is a first step towards more holistic multimodal affective feedback combining visual, auditory and tactile stimuli. An online survey garnered valence and arousal ratings of 32 stimuli that varied in colour, contour, pulse size and pulse speed. The results support previous research but also provide new findings and highlight the effects of each individual visual parameter on perceived emotion. We present a mapping of all stimulus combinations onto the common two-dimensional valence-arousal model of emotion.},

In this pilot study, we experimented with three basic mappings between data and visualizations by controlling the pen movement in speed, path and pen-down timing. The results show that the pen's speed could present changing heart rate data in real-time and the pen's path mainly affects the data visualization and the aesthetic of the plotted drawings. Finally, we discuss the possibility and limitations of the pen plotter used in information display and interaction design.},

Results of two online studies (n1=592, n2=243) show that the psychometric properties of the BrainHex model could be improved.

In this paper, we present the results of a focus group with nine K-6 children revealing their opinions about (i) art, (ii) museums and galleries, and (iii) standard engagement practices in these venues. Participants stressed the importance of art and museums, showed a high respect for artworks and artists, depicted interactive activities they liked at museums, and described how they would liven up art venues. In addition, we explored a way of using augmented reality (AR) technology to create an engaging and personal art experience for a young audience. To achieve this, we built a prototype for a treasure hunt style game where participants coloured a contour drawing not knowing what exactly they are colouring. However, they were told that if this coloured drawing is placed correctly, it should wrap around a 3D object (statue) or overlay a 2D canvas (picture) somewhere in the gallery.},

abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) is most commonly implemented using a camera and a flat screen. Such implementation removes binocular disparity from users' observation. To compensate, people use alternative depth cues (e.g. depth ordering). However, these cues may also get distorted in certain AR implementations, creating depth distortion which is problematic in situations where precise hand interaction within AR workspace is required such as when transcribing augmented instructions to physical objects (e.g. virtual tracing -- creating a physical sketch on a 2D or 3D object given a virtual image on a mobile device). In this paper we explore how depth distortion affects 3D virtual tracing by implementing a first of its kind 3D virtual tracing prototype and run an observational study. Drawing performance exceeded our expectations suggesting that the lack of visual depth cues, whilst holding the object in hand, is not as problematic as initially predicted. However, when placing the object on the stand and drawing with only one hand (the other is used for holding the phone) their performance drastically decreased.},

This paper reviews the current literature on the potential benefits of both standard digital games and exergaming in a fitness and healthcare context. The review also highlights a gap in the current literature, finding little research has explored the potential of combining standard COTS digital games and exergaming to provide a more engaging, motivating and enduring user experience.},

abstract = {The color red has been shown to hinder performance, motivation, and affect in a variety of contexts involving cognitively demanding tasks. Teams wearing red have been shown to impair the performance of opposing teams, present even in online gaming. Although color is strongly contextual (e.g., red-failure association), its effects are posited to be sub-conscious and operate powerfully even on nonhuman primates, e.g., Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) take food significantly less often from an experimenter wearing red. Here, we present one of the first studies on avatar color in a single-player game. We compared players using a red avatar to players using a blue avatar. Using the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), we find that players using a red avatar had a decrease in competence, immersion and flow. Our results are of consequence to how we design and choose colors in single-player contexts.},

Via the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), participants in the Neutral condition had significantly improved flow, immersion, and affect than participants in the None condition. Moreover, participants in both the Positive and Neutral conditions had the highest overall GEQ ratings. These findings are directly relevant to educational games.},

abstract = {StarCraft is one of the most successful real-time strategy (RTS) games and is also actively being researched by artificial intelligence (AI) communities. Since 2010, game AI researchers have hosted annual AI competition events to develop human-level RTS AIs using StarCraft. It ranks the AI bots by their winning ratio from thousands of AI vs. AI matches without human involvement. It is questionable whether successful AI bots are also competitive and preferable to human players. In this study, we invited 20 experienced players with varying expertise to evaluate skill levels, overall performance and human likeness of AI bots. Results show that human's ranking of AI bots are not identical to the current one from AI competitions. It suggests the need for developing new AI competitions that consider human factors ("human-likeness" or "adaptation"). Also, it revealed that the expertise levels of human players have high impact on overall performance and human-likeness evaluations of AI bots. It supports the concept of dynamically adjusting AI bots to satisfy different levels of human players. The outcomes of this study will also be useful to incorporate human factors in other active video AI competitions (e.g., Angry Birds, Fighting Game, and General Game Playing).},

As the experience of 'fun' in games is imprecise and multi-faceted, various psychological and experiential phenomena have been investigated in an effort to evaluate and quantify aspects of the player experience. Psychophysiology provides a useful lens through which to objectively and quantitatively measure and evaluate these phenomena. This study reports current electrodermal activity (EDA) findings from a large-scale ongoing study investigating the psychophysiology of play using electrodermal activity, electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrocardiography. Initial EDA results point to greater arousal the more challenging the play experience. Findings also indicate that EDA potentially reports arousal with greater real-time accuracy than a subjective arousal measure. Ultimately, with this work, we aim contribute to a greater understanding of the psychophysiological evaluation and impact of play.},

abstract = {Biofeedback games have the potential to make gaming a deeply personal experience by linking the gamespace to each player's physiological state. First, this paper describes the psycho-educational potential of the horror-themed biofeedback game Nevermind. In Nevermind, players' heart rate is continuously read into the game which in turn adapts to the player's momentary levels of negative affective arousal. Greater negative arousal causes the game and its horror-themed settings to become more disturbing. As a result, Nevermind challenges players to improve their emotion regulation skills by encouraging them to healthily down-regulate their negative affective states in the face of stressful situations. Second, Nevermind implements valuable design practices, practices which we share here. Finally, we describe a recent study conducted on 47 players. We discuss potential physiological metrics which may be useful for understanding how behaviors in the real world relate to those in biofeedback games like Nevermind.},

abstract = {Playing video games with a partner can be fun, but are the players in flow? The study of flow, a state of intense immersion in an activity, is an important element of game research. Recently, partners in multiplayer games have been shown to impact a player's flow state. However, as flow can be difficult to assess during a game, brain activity, measured with electroencephalography, has recently been employed as a tool to evaluate flow state continuously and without bias. Thus, this paper investigates the relationship between two partners' flow states and brain activity. We carried out a preliminary empirical study in which participants played doubles in a tennis game, while EEG data and psychometric measures were acquired. Our results show an interaction between a player's neurophysiological activity and a partner's flow state. In the long run, this work opens the door for games designed to optimize positive emotional contagion.},

abstract = {Anxiety disorders are among the most frequently diagnosed mental health problems in children, leading to potentially devastating outcomes on a personal level and high costs for society. Although evidence-based interventions are readily available, their outcomes are often disappointing and variable. In particular, existing interventions are not effective long-term nor tailored to differences in individual responsiveness. We therefore need a new approach to the prevention and treatment of anxiety in children and a commensurate scientific methodology to uncover individual profiles of change. We argue that applied games have a great deal of potential for both. The current paper presents results from a recent pilot study using a biofeedback virtual reality game (DEEP). DEEP integrates established therapeutic principles with an embodied and intuitive learning process towards improved anxiety regulation skills.},

abstract = {In rock climbing, discussing climbing techniques with others to master a specific route and getting practical advice from more experienced climbers is an inherent part of the culture and tradition of the sport. Spatial information, such as the position of holds, as well as learning complex body postures plays a major role in this process. A typical problem that occurs during advising is an alignment effect when trying to picture orientation-specific knowledge, e.g. explaining how to perform a certain self-climbed move to others. We propose betaCube, a self-calibrating camera-projection unit that features 3D tracking and distortion-free projection. The system enables a life-sized video replay and climbing route creation using augmented reality. We contribute an interface for automatic setup of mobile distortion-free projection, blob detection for climbing holds, as well as an automatic method for extracting planar trackables from artificial climbing walls.},

However, there were significant differences in flow and engagement between a subgroup of the experimental condition who failed to complete the goal in the game within the specified time limit, and other subgroups in both conditions who successfully completed it. The findings suggest that there may be an optimal time limit in which autonomy and competence are maximized, and thus intrinsic motivation, flow, engagement, performance, and enjoyment are promoted.},

Few people are particularly aware of the permission settings or make changes to them. We hypothesize that both the difficulty in checking permission settings for all apps on a device, along with the lack of flexibility in deciding what happens to one's data, makes the perceived cost to protect one's privacy too high. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a study that explores what happens when permission settings are more discretional at install time. We present the results of a pilot experiment, in which we ask users to negotiate which data they are happy to share, and we show that this results in higher user satisfaction than the typical take-it-or-leave-it setting. Our preliminary findings suggest negotiating consent is a powerful interaction mechanism that engages users and can enable them to strike a balance between privacy and pricing concerns.},

abstract = {The safe prescribing of medications via computerized physician order entry routinely relies on clinical alerts. Alert compliance, however, remains surprisingly low, with up to 95% often ignored. Prior approaches, such as improving presentational factors in alert design, had limited success, mainly due to physicians' lack of trust in computerized advice. While designing trustworthy alert is key, actionable design principles to embody elements of trust in alerts remain little explored. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a model to guide the design of trust-based clinical alerts-based on what physicians value when trusting advice from peers in clinical activities. We discuss three key dimensions to craft trusted alerts: using colleagues' endorsement, foregrounding physicians' prior actions, and adopting a suitable language. We exemplify our approach with emerging alert designs from our ongoing research with physicians and contribute to the current debate on how to design effective alerts to improve patient safety.},

abstract = {The ability for one to navigate independently can be essential to maintaining employment, taking care of oneself, and leading a fulfilling life. However, for people who are blind, navigation-related tasks in public spaces--such as locating an empty seat--can be difficult without appropriate tools, training, or social context. We present a study of social norms in environments with predominately blind navigators and discuss how these may differ from what sighted people expect. Based on these findings, we advocate for the creation of more pervasive technologies to help bridge the gap between social norms when people with visual impairments are in predominately sighted environments.},

As the first step towards this direc- tion, we carried out an autoethnographic study to practice DIYbiology, by setting up a functional DIYbio space inside our HCI design studio.

Our approach automatically optimizes the placement of environment elements to maximize the flow of the crowd, while satisfying constraints that are imposed by the user (e.g., immovable walls or support bearing structures). We take steps towards user-in-the-loop optimization and design of an environment by applying an adaptive refinement approach to reduce the search space of the optimization. We perform a small scale user study to obtain early feedback on the performance and quality of our method in contrast with a manual approach.},

We conducted ethnographic observations and interviews for 4 months, discovering systemic information flow barriers. This paper focuses on patient isolation status, which is put into place when a communicable disease is discovered, and how status propagation is sometimes delayed, increasing risk of Hospital-Acquired Infection (HAI). We use DiCoT to navigate the solution space, and propose introducing digital signs. Our main contribution is describing how DiCoT principles quickly led us to solutions to improving information flow in critical care. In future work, we will conduct further investigation, with additional design iterations.},

Our experiment showed that TMDb has the highest perceived similarity, followed by cosine and TF-IDF, while Pearson was practically unusable for users.

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the use of technological instructional pacing supports to teach students with intellectual disability (ID). Based on a qualitative field study where 11 participants used our mobile-based educational platform, we found that although technology may help the instructor control the pace of the class, it also poses barriers to the development of students' autonomy and self-esteem. Our preliminary results also suggest that the balance between instructor-led and self-paced instruction based on technology is promising and would better fit both instructor's and students' needs. These findings provide insights into challenges and opportunities for the design of educational initiatives targeted at people with ID.},

abstract = {Goal-setting is a valuable behavior change strategy. For patients with multiple sclerosis, a variety of factors such as symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue), environmental factors (e.g., weather), and mood can all greatly influence a person's ability to meet daily goals. Based on this, these patients and others with chronic pain, would likely benefit from strategies that could aid them in developing their own personalized physical activity goals that can take into account these factors dynamically. The purpose of this formative study was to explore this problem space via interviews and early formative prototyping of possible protocols to aid people in developing their own personalized and adaptive goals. Results from this work suggest interest in tools to support rules to help individuals define their "sweet spot" target for physical activity and further work appears warranted with longer studies.},

To support social interaction, several video-sharing websites Including Ustream, niconico, and Twitch - allow users to post messages while they are watching videos. As users' comments can be sorted according to the timecode of each video, this is known as time-anchored commenting. We propose a novel visualization method, ToPIN, which is able to analyze and categorize the topics and content types of users' time-anchored comments. We have also developed a visualization interface that combines the visualization techniques of ToPIN and ThemeRiver to generate additional valuable insights for analysts seeking to make sense of time-anchored comments. To test the utility of our approach, we visualized time-anchored commenting data from two online course videos and invited the course instructors to evaluate our system.},

Technology-based rehabilitation has been proven to be beneficial for specific patient groups, as it shows to be effective on muscle strength and active range of motion of the upper limbs. Personalized training in technology-supported rehabilitation setups using motivational techniques such as serious games have the potential to make repetitive training efforts more endurable. Most neurological rehabilitation approaches suffer from a strict separation between training scenarios and activities in daily living, but have difficulties to bridge the gap between exercising on a functional level and performing on the level of activities in daily living. To improve the integration of motor skill training in a daily living context we propose an approach and proof-of-concept implementation of the training device ReHappy, a tangible character that engages patient in performing additional training that complements the daily activities.},

Our findings indicated that, although similar in age, participants' needs varied in level of interest in technology to support biological needs to those of social and spiritual needs. This highlights a culture shift that should occur within the technology for aging sphere as well -- one that addresses varying needs based on life course and other 'person- centered' characteristics as opposed to simply age-based.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method to enable any smart Wearable to sense vital data in resting states. These resting states (e.g. sleeping, sitting calmly, etc.) imply the presence of low-amplitude body-motions. Our approach relies on seismocardiography (SCG), which only requires a built-in accelerometer. Compared to commonly applied technologies, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), our approach is not only tracking heart rate (HR), but also respiration rate (RR), and microvibrations (MV) of the muscles, while being also computational inexpensive. In addition, we can calculate several other parameters, such as HR variability and RR variability. Our extracted vital parameters match with the vital data gathered from clinical state-of-the art technology. These data allow us to gain an impression on the user's activity, quality of sleep, arousal and stress level over the whole day, week, month, or year. Moreover, we can detect whether a device is actually worn or doffed, which is crucial when connecting such data with health services. We implemented our method on two current smartwatches: a Simvalley AW420 RX as well as on a LG G Watch R and recorded user data for several months. A web platform enables to keep track of one's data.},

With visual analytics in particular, displays of large datasets quickly become crowded and unclear. Through observing the practices of analysts working with the event sequence visualization tool EventFlow, we identified three techniques to reduce initial visual complexity by reducing the number of event categories resulting in a simplified overview. For novice users, we suggest an initial pair of event categories to display. For advanced users, we provide six ranking metrics and display all pairs in a ranked list. Finally, we present the Event Category Matrix (ECM), which simultaneously displays overviews of every event category pair. In this work, we report on the development of these techniques through two formative usability studies and the improvements made as a result. The goal of our work is to investigate strategies that help users overcome the challenges associated with initial visual complexity and to motivate the use of simplified overviews in temporal event sequence analysis.},

abstract = {Walking is the most ubiquitous physical activity. Natural walking and other physical activity opportunities, however, have been declining in developed societies. This decline has been linked to the rise of obesity. Smartphone health and fitness apps aim to reverse this trend by motivating people to be more physically active. The core philosophy in many of these applications is to either promote user competition or set universal goals and overwhelm the user with information. We present a physical activity app design that is closer to a goal oriented approach but with a twist. This new design is based on minimalism, where simple targets are set in a personalized manner and social comparison takes a secondary role. Specifically, the app gives to the user a daily caloric goal to consume by walking or biking. The formula that computes this goal is based on the user's food intake, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Body Mass Index (BMI). Our hypothesis is that methods emphasizing simple and precise personalized directions have better chance than pure competition methods to keep users engaged. Results from a pilot comparative study render initial support to this hypothesis.},

In order to explore how wearables might support teachers with classroom orchestration, we used the Apple Watch as a technology probe where we co-designed three use cases with teachers. These use cases involved sending teachers activity notifications about student activity, lesson reminders about teachers' pedagogical activity, and allowing moment capture, where teachers photographed classroom events for further study. The technology probe illustrates how the watch fits with teachers' practice, and details teachers' new ideas for supporting classroom orchestration. We also outline design implications and objectives for wearable design.},

abstract = {The Internet enables users to access vast resources, but it can also expose users to harmful cyber-attacks. It is imperative that users be informed about a security incident in a timely manner in order to make proper decisions. Visualization of security threats and warnings is one of the effective ways to inform users. However, visual cues are not always accessible to all users, and in particular, those with visual impairments. This late-breaking-work paper hypothesizes that the use of proper sounds in conjunction with visual cues can better represent security alerts to all users. Toward our research goal to validate this hypothesis, we first describe a methodology, referred to as sonification, to effectively design and develop auditory cyber-security threat indicators to warn users about cyber-attacks. Next, we present a case study, along with the results, of various types of usability testing conducted on a number of Internet users who are visually impaired. The presented concept can be viewed as a general framework for the creation and evaluation of human factor interactions with sounds in a cyber-space domain. The paper concludes with a discussion of future steps to enhance this work.},

abstract = {Weaving is a traditional technology for making everyday products by hand that involves interlacing planar pieces to endow tough and pliable properties, (e.g., bamboo and stiff paper) to create 3D shapes. The technique has been extensively applied throughout history by various means, and is favored due to its low cost, accessibility, and environmental friendliness. Traditional weaving technology, however, requires accumulated craft expertise and actual production through numerous iterations, which is generally very time-consuming -- this limits its design aesthetic and ubiquitous use. Inspired by these problems, we present a novel hand-woven fabrication approach called CompuWoven to customize and weave 3D objects from planar pieces. The key idea is to establish an approach for producing 3D objects that is similar to weaving tradition, but without the need for manual experience. In addition, CompuWoven eliminates the former need for supporting structures, reduces actual physical material waste and allows for more complicated and irregular designs.},

We present a pilot study in which data from Learning Analytics is provided to two secondary school teachers by means of an ambient display, called Lernanto. Semi-structured interviews, after a ten-week testing period, reveal that immediate access to learning analytics through an ambient display, next to using a LA dashboard, could result in teachers being able to distribute their attention more efficiently during lessons.},

For each, we highlight the ways in which the enactment of the mythology is problematized by disconnects between aggregate and drill-down views of data that often impede the desired actionability. Our findings contribute initial empirical evidence of the ways in which the epistemological biases of BI systems influence organizations.

The disruptive nature poses the challenge of finding opportune moments for delivery of notifications, and receptivity to notifications depends on various factors that include perceived urgency and time of delivery. This paper presents a case study with 126 000 participants investigating the effect of the factor time on receptivity to notifications on smartphones in the context of an advertising service. Results show significant differences for weekdays and time of day regarding response times and number of notification-triggered application launches.

abstract = {The emerging games-to-life genre is gaining popularity in the computer games market. This type of games makes use of physical figurines that represent in-game characters, and permits the control of certain aspects of the game. This makes it possible for designers to create new types of game play that blend physical and virtual space. Play can be classified as intervention or performative [apperley2006genre]. In existing games-to-life games, the interactions that entail both spaces are performed only during intervention play. In contrast, interactions during performative play are still performed with standard controllers. This work presents a novel interface to be used in performative play. This interface is composed by a physical toy with an attached sensor device, and enables users to control the emotions of a virtual character. The interface has been evaluated with a user test. Results shows that it performs at least as well as a standard touch interface in several usability aspects.},

Our system estimates the moving amount of the thumb by muscles' expansion caused by its movement. The muscle expansion is measured by a specially designed wrist-worn sensor device. Moreover, the device can recognize the clench of the hand as an instantaneous change of the wrist's contour. In this paper, we show the implementation of ThumbSlide and its example applications.},

abstract = {Smartwatches have gained a lot of public interest as one of the most popular wearable devices in recent times, but their diminutive touch screens mar the user experiences. The small screen of watch suffers from visual occlusion and the fat finger problem. To address these issues, we present PressTact that extends interaction space beyond the watch surface to the sides of the device. It augments smartwatches with four pressure sensors - two sensors on the left side of a watch and another two on the right side. It enables users to input different levels of pressure that can be used for bi-directional navigation (zooming, scrolling, rotation) on smartwatches. In this paper, we explore the pressure event based input vocabulary set. Our preliminary user study shows that participants can input different pressure levels (light press, medium press, and strong press) in discrete and continuous mode with an acceptable accuracy. Finally, we develop several example applications to illustrate the potential of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {We present VRSurus, a smart device designed to recognize the puppeteer's gestures and render tactile feedback to enhance the interactivity of physical puppets in virtual reality (VR). VRSurus is wireless, self-contained, and small enough to be mounted upon any physical puppets. Using machine-learning techniques, VRSurus is able to recognize three gestures: swiping, shaking and thrusting. Actuators (e.g., solenoids, servos and vibration motors) assist with the puppetry visible to the audience and provide tactile feedback on the puppeteer's forearm. As a proof of concept, we implemented a tangible serious VR game using VRSurus that aimed at inspiring children to protect the environment and demonstrated it at the ACM UIST 2015 Student Innovation Contest. Our 3D models, circuitry and the source code are publicly available at www.vrsurus.com.},

abstract = {The massive increase in connected devices and the opportunities they present makes it essential to give users a tool to manage the complexity of such systems. This new landscape creates the need to memorize multiple relations and connections, between different objects and their functionalities. Thus, a big mental load is required for the user in order to interact with these devices. In this paper, we present a novel approach using a drawable user interface. We explain the capabilities of drawing to interact with connected devices and how they empower users to define the functions of their system based on their personal, local and often task-specific needs. We also explore different applications for this type of interaction as well as its implementation. Finally, we discuss how to use our concept in order to design a drawable programming language.},

abstract = {Recently there has been a surge of interest in wearable devices both in industry and academia. This includes the introduction of head-worn devices into everyday life. Head-worn devices have the advantage of containing a screen that is easily seen by the wearer at all times, in contrast with other device screens, which can be hidden in pockets or simply easily ignored. However, during certain activities it can be difficult to get the wearer to notice messages even when presented through head-worn devices. For certain applications, it may be important that the user does not miss a particular notification or warning. Not much is known about which methods work best to attract the users' attention in such situations. We describe results from two user studies to determine the best method to catch the attention of a user with a head-worn display.},

The goal of this augmentation is to improve a digital artist's ability to control their work through tactile manipulation, as well as expand the artist's range of expression and effects.

Callout design, a design principle that involves the placement of a callout in a non-occluded area in order to display the occluded area, could eliminate occlusion. However, callout designs for ultra-small touch screen devices have not yet been explored. In this study, we conducted an experiment to examine eight callout designs for ultra-small touch screen devices. The results show that the selection speed was higher when the content of the callout was changed continuously, the error rate decreased when a pointer was displayed to indicate the touched position within the callout, and the workload decreased when the content was changed continuously. Further, the score that subjectively evaluates the performance decreased when the position of the callout was fixed.},

We show that reporting this metric using mean movement time per user over accuracy-adjusted Index of Difficulty (IDe) produces more descriptive visualization. This method displays variance, which is more useful in understanding the interfaces, than an aggregated means-of-means approach using Index of Difficulty. We demonstrate that there is little difference in slope and intercept between the two methods, but has the potential to uncover wider goodness-of-fit coefficients which could allow for better comparison across experiments. We propose the use of quantile regression to report central tendencies as a trend, rather than box plots. The tools released with this paper can be used with any pointing device evaluation done with the FittsStudy program. The dataset released with this paper contains almost 25,000 samples, which can be used in future research for reporting or visualizing Fitts regressions.},

abstract = {In mobile contexts guidance towards objects is usually done through the visual channel. Sometimes this channel is overloaded or not appropriate. A practicable form of haptic feedback is challenging. Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) can generate mobile force feedback but has a number of drawbacks. For complex movements several muscles need to be actuated in concert and a feedback loop is necessary to control movements. We present an approach that only requires the actuation of six muscles with four pairs of electrodes to guide the index finger to a 2D point and let the user perform mid-air disambiguation gestures. In our user study participants found invisible, static target positions on top of a physical box with a mean 2D deviation of 1.44 cm from the intended target.},

A body of work investigated interaction beyond direct touch. In particular, previous work proposed using the device's rear as an interaction surface and the grip of the hands that hold the device as a means of input. While previous work provides a categorization of grip styles, a detailed understanding of the preferred fingers' position during different tasks is missing. This understanding is needed to develop ergonomic grasp-based and Back-of-Device interaction techniques. We report from a study to understand users' finger position during three representative tasks. We highlight the areas that are already covered by the users' hands while using the on-screen keyboard, reading a text, and watching a video. Furthermore, we present the position of each of the user's fingers during these tasks. From the results, we derive interaction possibilities from an ergonomic perspective.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the front touch interface: a new HMD-embedded interface where users interact with the virtual world via a touchpad placed in front of the VR headset. To demonstrate the feasibility of the interface, we built a prototype device, and performed a user study on a selection task using a simple menu layout. Two new selection techniques, Two-Finger and Drag-n-Tap, were also explored to find the appropriate input method for the front touch interface. As a low-cost, light-weight, and low power-budget technology, a touch sensor can make an ideal interface for a mobile VR headset. With this novel front touch interface, we have devised a new design space of VR interactions.},

In this work, we revisit this concept, where instead of considering every physical surface and object as a display, we seek to determine areas that are suitable for the projection and interaction with digital information. After determining a set of requirements that such surfaces need to fulfil, we describe a novel computer vision-based technique to automatically detect rectangular surface regions that are deemed adequate for projection and mark those areas as available placeholders for users to use as "clean" displays. As a proof of concept, we show how content can be adaptively laid out in those placeholders using a simple tablet UI.},

It is a computer device that integrates an attractive design and exploits rotation as an interaction technique to access different types of information presented on each side of the cube. CubeLendar is aimed to notify about calendar events via light and represent potential situations for spontaneous communication with remote co-workers. Moreover, due to its appealing design CubeLendar nicely integrates into the office environment as a pleasant enhancement. In this paper, we outline the design concept of CubeLendar, hardware design, and first usability feedback. In our future research we aim to extend the feedback modalities for our CubeLendar prototype and build a network of such awareness devices to facilitate spontaneous communication in spatially distributed groups.},

An expanded version of the system is also used to design visual states for an atomic visualisation platform called danceroom Spectroscopy, that allows participants to explore quantum phenomena through movement and dance.

In this work, we show how the degree of freedom offered by the elbow joint, i.e., flexion and extension, can be leveraged as an additional one-handed input modality for smartwatches. By moving the watch towards or away from the body, the user is able to provide input to the smartwatch without a second hand. We present the results of a controlled experiment focusing on the human capabilities for proximity-based interaction. Based on the results, we propose guidelines for designing proximity-based smartwatch interfaces and present ProxiWatch: a one-handed and proximity-based input modality for smartwatches alongside a prototypical implementation.},

abstract = {The use of touch-based interaction now dominates the market as it enables a more natural form of interaction with our devices, but is largely limited to flat and rigid surfaces. The increasing availability of flexible interactive technologies offers us the opportunity to design devices that adapt to their context of use and opens up new avenues for the design of interaction on a flexible device for 'multi-context interaction'. In this paper, we present initial work in this direction through an explorative pilot study. Interestingly, the participants were rather influenced by standard tactile input gestures and envisioned using these for interaction while taking advantage of the flexible properties of the device for adaptation instead, either to the context or the object to which the device is attached (e.g. pressure input, positioning of the device and deformation).},

All these activities have to be arranged in a complex choreography in order to allow the audience to experience the illusion of the interaction between these devices and the performer's movements. IStage is an interactive system that allows controlling the on-stage equipment through the use of body movements and gestures. The aim is to enhance the performance on-stage and at the same time to enrich the audience's overall engagement with the show. The project contributes by presenting a generic toolkit for artists; to enable interactive performances, as well as that it is cost-effective, easy-to-use, and easy-to-install. The initial prototype involves a Microsoft Kinect 2 used as the primary sensing device to track the body gestures, in combination with a sound impact sensor. IStage uses a set of output devices: a projector, led strips, a bubble machine and audio. Lastly, we also present the results of a formative study.},

DooBoo is a pet-like dashboard system that applies the interactive characteristics of pet dogs. We illustrate three key potential scenarios: personal security, safe driving assistance, and vehicle information guidance. The preliminary user feedback showed the possibility of helping emotional driving experience with EV; they felt togetherness as it is another passenger, affection with the vehicle could grow, and it offered means of intuitive and visceral communication. We discuss implications of our prototype and study results for guiding emotional interactions with EV.},

However, existing methods typically suffer from the Midas touch problem, i.e. the difficult distinction between gaze for perception and for user action; proposed solutions have required custom-tailored, application-specific user interfaces. Here, we present SPOCK, a novel gaze interaction method based on smooth pursuit eye movements requiring only minimal extensions to button-based interfaces. Upon looking at a UI element, two overlaid dynamic stimuli appear and tracking one of them triggers activation. In contrast to fixations and saccades, smooth pursuits are not only easily performed, but also easily suppressed, thus greatly reducing the Midas touch problem. We evaluated SPOCK against dwell time, the state-of-the-art gaze interaction method, in a simple target selection and a more challenging multiple-choice scenario. At higher task difficulty, unintentional target activations were reduced almost 15-fold by SPOCK, making this a promising method for gaze interaction.},

Since input and output are co-located, displays have to be positioned within hand's reach. When the display is outside the reach envelope, a touchpad has been used as a control device. Current implementation of touchpads in cars rely on a relative input method that requires a visual cursor and is known to cause distraction from primary driving task. Newer touchpads with force sensing ability are getting introduced in notebook computers. We propose to use a force-enabled touchpad with absolute mapping for target selection. We performed a controlled experiment as a first step towards assessing whether absolute mapped force input target selection performance can be comparable to direct touch input. Results show that target selection performance is not significantly different from direct touch input making a case for force-enabled touchpad usage in scenarios where the display is outside the reach envelope.},

Using a system of force sensing combined with a digital model of the object; the system is capable of detecting a single touch, its position and the corresponding force of that touch anywhere on the object. In order to aid and encourage other practitioners to use such technology we demonstrate how to build such a system and describe two illustrative examples.},

abstract = {The use of the skin as interaction surface is gaining popularity in the HCI community. To offer an alternative perspective on how we might design on-body interactions, we conducted a questionnaire asking if, how, and why people mark their skin. We found that visibility and ease of access were important factors for choosing to mark the body. We also found that while some participants consider marking the body as a private activity, most participants perceive such markings as a public display. This tension between the personal nature of on-body interaction and the skin as a public display, as well as hedonic uses of body markings, present interesting design challenges.},

abstract = {We show a capacitive touch sensor called MonoTouch, which differentiates taps, swipe gestures, and swipe directions. MonoTouch consists of only an electrode and a circuit. To differentiate touch gestures with a single electrode, we designed the electrode's layout to satisfy the following two requirements: (1) The number of responses is different between the gestures; (2) The response time is different between swipe directions. We then developed an electrode that differentiates taps and four directional swipe gestures. When our MonoTouch electrode is downsized, gesture differentiation accuracy decreases because a finger might cross two or more conductive parts. To solve this "Multiple Crossing Problem", we added embossments on the electrode surface. Our evaluation of the MonoTouch sensor indicates that using the embossments solved the "Multiple Crossing Problem".},

abstract = {Generic multi-button controllers are the most common input devices used for video games. In contrast, dedicated game controllers and gestural interactions increase immersion and playability. Room-sized gaming has opened up possibilities to further enhance the immersive experience, and provides players with opportunities to use full-body movements as input. We present a purpose-centric approach to appropriating everyday objects as physical game controllers, for immersive room-sized gaming. Virtual manipulations supported by such physical controllers mimic real-world function and usage. Doing so opens up new possibilities for interactions that flow seamlessly from the physical into the virtual world. As a proof-of-concept, we present a 'Tower Defence' styled game, that uses four everyday household objects as game controllers, each of which serves as a weapon to defend the base of the players from enemy bots. Players can use 1) a mop (or a broom) to sweep away enemy bots directionally; 2) a fan to scatter them away; 3) a vacuum cleaner to suck them; 4) a mouse trap to destroy them. Each controller is tracked using a motion capture system. A physics engine is integrated in the game, and ensures virtual objects act as though they are manipulated by the actual physical controller, thus providing players with a highly-immersive gaming experience.},

The amount of these personal disclosures has raised issues and concerns regarding SNSs' privacy. Users' attitudes toward privacy and their sharing behaviours are inconsistent because they are concerned about privacy, but continue sharing personal information. Also, the existing privacy settings are not flexible enough to prevent privacy risks. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Privacy Settings Model (PSM) that can lead users to understand, control, and update SNSs' privacy settings. We believe that this model will enhance their privacy behaviours toward SNSs' privacy settings and reduce privacy risks.},

abstract = {Video data of people interacting with devices contains rich information about human behaviour that can be used to design or improve user experience. As a first step, it must be interpreted -- or coded -- into a form that can be analyzed systematically. The coding process is currently performed manually, and it can be slow and difficult, and biased by subjectivity. This is particularly problematic when trying to obtain data that should be objective, such as the movements of a user in relation to a device. We describe Automated Behavioural Coding (ABC), an open source object tracking technique designed to log user and device movements, and then output positional data that can be used to model interaction. We validate the technique in a study of dual screen TV viewing, and show that the ABC tool is able to correctly classify the direction of gaze to the TV or tablet up to 95% of the time, in a fraction of the time it takes to capture this data manually.},

abstract = {Facial expression mapping is the process of attributing signal values to a particular set of muscle activations in the face. This paper proposes the development of a broad lexicon of quantifiable, reproducible facial expressions with known signal values using an expressive 3D model and crowdsourced labeling data. Traditionally, coding muscle movements in the face is a time-consuming manual process performed by specialists. Identifying the communicative content of an expression generally requires generating large sets of posed photographs, with identifying labels chosen from a circumscribed list. Consequently, the widely accepted collection of configurations with known meanings is limited to six basic expressions of emotion. Our approach defines mappings from parameterized facial expressions displayed by a 3D avatar to their semantic representations. By collecting large, free-response label sets from na\"{\i}ve raters and using natural language processing techniques, we converge on a semantic centroid, or single label quickly and with low overhead.},

We investigate smartphone usage for college students using surveys, logged data, and interviews. Specifically, we adapted existing smartphone addiction assessment instruments to measure app addiction. The analysis of our data shows that social and communication apps are the top 2 most addictive categories among participants. Female and male participants show no significant difference in terms of smartphone addiction. However, female participants tend to report that they are addicted to more apps. The psychological factors associated with app addiction are different between app categories. For example, compared to communication apps, participants report that it is easier to withdraw from social apps, but more difficult to control time spent on them. Correlation analysis between app usage features and app addictiveness scores reveals that compulsive open times, usage duration, and regularity of usage are good indicators of app addiction, though response time to notifications has limited predictive power.},

abstract = {Uber and Airbnb, two well-known sharing economy services, are facing conflicts with traditional taxi and hotel companies because these services have monetary benefits but are free from legacy regulations. However, non-monetary-based sharing services, represented by Couchsurfing, Inc., are free from such conflict and still successful. We investigated the distinctive user participation motivation of non-monetary-based sharing services versus monetary-based ones. Specifically, a comparative analysis of Couchsurfing with Airbnb was conducted via affinity diagramming from host profiles and guest review data. The human relationship, rather than a house, is discovered as the primary shared asset and the primary satisfaction feature for Couchsurfing users. This study gives an insight to prioritize human relationships as the main design concern while developing non-monetary based sharing economy services.},

abstract = {The factors affecting the social acceptability of wearable devices are not well understood, yet they have a strong influence on whether a new wearable succeeds or fails. Factors uniquely affecting wearable acceptability as compared to other technology include manners, moral codes, the symbolic communication of dress, habits of dress, fashion, context of use, form, and aesthetics. This paper describes the development of the WEarable Acceptability Range (WEAR Scale), designed to predict acceptance of a particular wearable. First, the construct "social acceptability of a wearable" was defined using literature and an interview study. Second, the WEAR Scale's item pool was composed, and reviewed by experts. Third, the resulting scale was administered to sample respondents along with validation measures. The data will be evaluated for reliability and validity, and the scale's length will be adjusted, culminating in a validated WEAR Scale useful to both industry and academia.},

This preliminary study explores how the perceived social endorsement of both stimulating and non-stimulating content influences physiological arousal (skin conductance level). Stimulating pictures triggered more physiological arousal than non-stimulating pictures, but only when the picture was framed as a "trending" picture. When the picture was labeled as a "non-trending" picture, non-stimulating pictures induced higher levels of physiological arousal than stimulating pictures. The present study lends insight into how people respond to endorsement cues on social media from an affective level. More importantly, it shows that endorsement on social media is not the panacea for receiving attention; the inherent nature of the content plays a critical role in how social cues are perceived.},

abstract = {Personas are artificial character based representations of user goals, attitudes, motivations and abilities which enable designers to focus their design efforts on key, targeted users. The success of personas in design is due to their capacity to enable designers to empathize with users and understand user goals. Persona development is rooted in the rigorous collection and analysis of data specifically related to the design project being undertaken. New design projects thus require the development of new personas. Since redevelopment is not always achievable attention has turned towards reuse of personas and the underlying data. This paper reports on ongoing research into the development of reusable personas for use by non-expert, everyday designers. Such designers are regularly faced with small scale but diverse design challenges for which they cannot carry out user research and modelling. They can, however, make use of general, reusable personas developed independently of their current design project.},

This apparent mismatch between theory and 'in-the-wild' usage has not been investigated to date. Through an in-depth qualitative study of a popular application Lift, this research establishes that common techniques such as reminders and streaks are effective at supporting repetition of new behaviors, but at the same time create a dependency: on-going app use is often required to achieve lasting change. This dependency introduces fragility in users' attempts to change their behavior, as they often abandon the app and subsequently disengage with their new behaviors.},

These however are somewhat restricted in applicability. Statements formed in Likert scaling are typically addressing one specific website. Therefore, adjusting these statements for other websites can be accompanied with a loss of validity. To meet these limitations, we propose to use semantic differential. Research has shown that using semantic differential is appropriate to measure multidimensional constructs [8,12] such as trust. Our novel approach in measuring trustworthiness exceeds Likert based scaling in its effortless application in different online context and its better translatability. After one pre-study and two online-studies with a total of 554 participants we achieved to develop a questionnaire with nine items which is comparable to other existing questionnaires in terms of reliability and internal consistency. But it overcomes the limitation of Likert scale based questionnaire.},

This case study identified relevant affective and pragmatic Kansei attributes that influence the purchase of a range hood (cooker hood). 102 customers rated the extent to which each of 10 range hoods possessed these attributes. In addition, AttrakDiff was used to measure hedonic and pragmatic quality perceptions. There was a general high correspondence between AttrakDiff and Kansei. While Kansei provided richer and more specific feedback, it was more resource intensive to carry out.},

abstract = {Our research question is: can digital media work as a substitute for traditional pen-and-paper, and can it enhance or support our thinking process? Affordances of paper versus digital and in particular around sketching have been largely discussed in the past. People often prefer pen and paper or whiteboards to software when it comes to the early stages of sensemaking tasks. Nowadays pen-enabled tablet-PCs are supposed to offer a sketching experience similar to pen and paper with good computation power and the ability to respond in real-time to user interactions. Therefore the question arises: how should pen-based interaction and user interfaces be designed to be more productive than pen and paper? We created a prototype tablet application called SketchViz focusing on easy restructuring of information for users and conducted a study comparing both the interactions and visual representations of 25 participants performing a given task using either pen and paper or SketchViz. The results show, that the visual representations made using the prototype were very similar to those made using pen and paper. Users especially liked the way the application allowed them to change size and position of drawn objects on the virtual canvas (which is different from current tools). They also mentioned having a better possibility to switch between detail and overview. Mainly due to technical problems, working with pen and paper was rated easier and was less time consuming. We conclude that if these problems are fixed, SketchViz will offer an interesting starting point for a digital alternative to pen and paper for the early stages of sensemaking tasks.},

This process allows practitioners to draw from the wealth of positive experiences in areas that easily lend themselves to those experiences and apply them to areas that might not have been the focus of positive design so far.

We also found that comparing to the one-dimensional view of the self-stated importance ratings, the Kano method was able to create richer conversation when analyzing the value of fixing the usability issues. Based on these findings, we recommend that product design practitioners incorporate end-user delight and frustration with the Kano method to help prioritize usability issues.},

The squat exercise was chosen because it is easily track-able due to its rigid and specific set of form specifications that allow it to be easily corrected.

Whilst human-machine trust has been examined extensively from within a technico-social framework, few efforts have been made to link the dynamics of trust within a steady-state operator-machine environment to the existing literature of the psychology of learning. We set out to recreate a commonly reported learning phenomenon within a trust acquisition environment: Users learning which algorithms can and cannot be trusted to reduce traffic in a city. We failed to replicate (after repeated efforts) the learning phenomena of "blocking", resulting in a finding that people consistently make a very specific error in trust assignment to cues in conditions of uncertainty. This error can be seen as a cognitive bias and has important implications for HCI.},

We present a novel methodology to measure human body parts that allows users to wear loose clothes during this process. This allows anyone at home or on the go to measure themselves and use the results with their 3D model to comfortably shop online. Reducing the risk of buying clothes that will not fit and making the online shopping experience more satisfying. We first scan the user on a single pose that allows better visualization of the waist and then measure four parts: chest, waist and low hip girths and height. Then, we use an API to compute the rest of the measurements. Clothes sizes differ in 4 to 5 cm and our results indicate an offset error of less than 4 cm. Hence, meeting our target immersive shopping use cases.},

In this paper, we study the performance of two presentation strategies in tasks that involve navigating to an object inside a hierarchy of physical containers within the user's reach. We consider two types of navigation aids: Those that provide route knowledge via step-by-step instructions, using simple graphical overlays, and those that provide survey knowledge via map-like overviews, using 3D depth visualizations. We performed a user study using a cardboard mock-up of a spatial display. Our experiment shows that in shallow hierarchies route aids and survey aids perform comparably in terms of navigation time and accuracy. When a target is embedded deeper into a structure, the performance of survey aids is affected negatively, while route aids maintain a consistent performance. Users re- ported that survey aids helped them understand a container hierarchy, but route aids required less processing time and effort, and thus, were more preferred. We found no significant effect of aid type on users' preference. Accordingly, we recommend considering the depth of task when employing these presentation strategies.},

However, it is unclear whether screen-based interface cues can elicit perceptions of femininity and what effects, if any, they would have on user evaluations of a robot. To address this, we conducted an experiment examining the effect of gender cue (male vs. female) and cue location (robot body vs. robot screen) upon user evaluations. Female interface cues, especially when conveyed via the screen, elicited greater perceptions of robot femininity than male interface cues. Implications for the design of social robotics are discussed.},

Autonomous car technology promises a relief from driving related stress and may change the commuting experience fundamentally. So far, research in this field has mainly been focused on commuting in manually driven cars or on usability and safety issues of specific driver automation technologies. In order to explore how to design activities and entertainment for future commuting in fully autonomous cars, we conducted a contextual inquiry inspired field study with three car-based commuters in an improvised autonomous car. This paper introduces our research setup and presents preliminary findings. It contributes to the exploration of the design space of autonomous driving in two ways: (1) the paper describes a pragmatic approach to adapt a contextual inquiry for the exploration of future use cases of autonomous driving and (2) it also articulates design implications and temporal frames derived from our first set of user studies that we regard as essential for designing context-sensitive entertainment in future cars.},

However, little strategic design framework is available to support user experience design in physical product development. Considering the interaction complexity and investment on physical multi-functional product, testified design frameworks can help largely shorten time span and improve cost efficiency. We present a late-breaking work about user experience design of Philips HD7762, a typical multi-functional household product with interactive utilities, with support of applying the five-plane web design framework proposed by Jesse James Garrett. The evaluation result turns to be positive. Thus we suggest product designers to take reference at web design strategies to support user experience design in interactive multi-functional product development.},

Moreover, we outline a tentative design and procedure of the main study. We plan to recruit over 250 participants that will rate different styles of animated transitions in regard to perceived pragmatic and hedonic quality. Our findings are expected to provide insights in users' perception of animation styles and therefore to have implications for graphical user interface design practice.},

However, playtests are not always feasible or affordable for smaller independent game studios, as they require specialized equipment and expertise. Given the recent growth and prevalence of independent developers, there is a need to adapt playtesting processes for indie studios to assist in creating an optimal player experience. Therefore, our research focuses on challenges and opportunities of integrating games user research in the development cycles of independent studios. We worked with three studios conducting playtests on their upcoming titles. In line with the CHI2016 #chi4good spirit this paper contributes to the important topic of adopting user research methods for indie and small game studios.

Recently, 'positive design' and fostering happiness through technology is gaining more attention. However, little empirical research has been conducted. We adopted a concept from positive psychology that describes different facets of positive experience: 'hedonic enjoyment' and 'personal expressiveness'. The aim of the present study was to explore how hedonic enjoyment and personal expressiveness relate to established UX concepts, such as affect and need satisfaction. We found that hedonic enjoyment was associated with less negative affect, more stimulation and hedonic qualities, whereas personal expressiveness was correlated with both increased positive and negative affect and psychological needs such as competence, relatedness, popularity and security. Our findings suggest that UX research might benefit from including personal expressiveness as a complementary concept when investigating experience with interactive technology.},

The model we propose for motion prediction is based on system modeling. Through recursive least-squares estimation, we can trace the vibration at real time and thus compensate for the handheld shake. We verified this model with tumbling E eye exams and subjective 10-point scale questionnaires. The experimental results reveal that the anti-shake mechanism successfully decreases sight fatigue when applied to mobile devices used in moving environments.},

In spite of our current knowledge about sensory systems and sensory devices, the biggest stumbling block for progress concerns the need for a deeper understanding of people's multisensory experiences in HCI. It is essential to determine what tactile, gustatory, and olfactory experiences we can design for, and how we can meaningfully stimulate such experiences when interacting with technology. Importantly, we need to determine the contribution of the different senses along with their interactions in order to design more effective and engaging digital multisensory experiences. Finally, it is vital to understand what the limitations are that come into play when users need to monitor more than one sense at a time. The aim of this workshop is to deepen and expand the discussion on touch, taste, and smell within the CHI community and promote the relevance of multisensory experience design and research in HCI.},

This workshop will bring together a set of HCI scholars, designers, and community members to discuss social justice perspectives on interaction design and technology. We will explore theoretical and methodological approaches in and around HCI that can help us generatively consider issues of power, privilege, and access in their complexity. We will discuss the challenges associated with taking a justice approach in HCI, looking toward existing practices we find both productive and problematic. This workshop will bridge current gaps in research and practice by developing concrete strategies for both designing and evaluating social change oriented work in HCI, where agendas are made clear and researchers are held accountable for the outcomes of their work by members of their field site and the research community.},

abstract = {Movement-based design is reaching critical mass in HCI, and we can start to identify strategies, similarities and differences in how it is approached. Similarities may include, for example, a strong first person perspective on design, emphasising movement, somatics and aesthetic sensibilities of the designer, as well as starting from the premise that our bodily ways of being in the world are shaped by the ecologies of people, cultural practices and the artefacts we create and use. Different classes of systems are starting to emerge, such as spurring somaesthetic appreciation processes using biofeedback loops or carefully nudging us to interact with our own movements; engaging us in affective loops where the technology takes on a stronger agency, attempting to pull participants into particular experiences; extending on our senses and perception -- even creating new senses through technology; social interactions, engaging us to jointly explore movement or touch; even endowing machines with their own "somatics", exploring our relationship to technology; as well as engaging in larger political issues around the body, such as gender perspectives, or challenging the mind-body divide.},

abstract = {Recent research on mobile collocated interactions has been looking at situations in which collocated users engage in collaborative activities using their mobile devices. However, existing practices fail to fully account for the culturally-dependent spatial relationships between people and their digital devices (i.e. the proxemic relationships). Building on the ideas of proxemic interactions, this workshop is motivated by the concept of 'proxemic mobile collocated interactions', to harness new or existing technologies to create engaging and interactionally relevant experiences. Such approaches would allow devices to not only react to presence and interaction, but also other indicators, such as the interpersonal distance people naturally use in everyday life. The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together a community of researchers, designers and practitioners who are interested in exploring proxemics and mobile collocated interactions.},

Technology plays an increasingly important role in this involvement. Developments we have observed in museum experience design, include trends towards 1) dialogical engagement of the public; 2) addressing crowds as audiences; 3) the use of Internet of Things (IoT) and Do-It-Yourself (DIY) technology in museums; and 4) designing for museum systems and institutional ecologies instead of for individual museums only. In this one-day workshop we especially focus on exploring the implications of museums reaching out to crowds beyond their local communities, and of museums increasingly becoming part of connected museum systems and large institutional ecosystems. By means of a tangible game we will brainstorm about future opportunities and challenges, cluster and evaluate them, and suggest future work.},

At our CHI 2015 workshop on ethical encounters, researchers shared personal stories of the challenges and tensions they have faced when conducting HCI research in complex settings such as hospitals, with young mental health patients, in schools for children with disabilities, and with homeless people. These research contexts can present significant challenges for HCI researchers who would not typically receive the training that other professionals working in these environments would normally receive. From our discussions with attendees at the CHI 2015 workshop, we identified a number of ethical issues that researchers are grappling with. In this follow-up workshop we aim to build on the lessons learned and to generate pragmatic but sensitive solutions to manage complex ethical issues for HCI researchers working in challenging settings.},

In this context, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) approaches may offer a number of value propositions for the learning, reusing, adapting, designing, developing, inventing, innovating, and sustaining Smart Cities and their inhabitants in Southeast Asia.

But the full potential for social scientists (and others) is not yet achieved. Despite the popularity of social media analysis in the past decade, few researchers invest in cross-platform analyses. This is a major oversight as 42% of Online Social Media users have multiple social media accounts. Missing are the models and tools necessary to undertake analysis at scale across multiple platforms. Especially promising in support of cross-platform analysis is the mixed method approach (e.g. qualitative and quantitative methods) in order to better understand how users and society interacts online. The workshop 'Following User Pathways' brings together a community of researchers and professionals to address methodological, analytical, conceptual, and technological challenges and opportunities of cross-platform, mixed method analysis in social media ecosystems.},

abstract = {In 2030, we will have a different interactive experience with our built environments, at home, at work, and even in public urban spaces. This is attributed to advancements in sensing and actuation systems that can integrate into the building infrastructures, in symbiosis with the new environmental concerns that call for new life, work, and mobility styles. This change, whether gradual or sudden, evident or seamless, can have a remarkable impact on our everyday experiences, and thus entails efforts to envision possible scenarios and plan for them. We believe that buildings, as they would embody our digital and physical interactive daily experiences, should be designed and nurtured in a dialogue with their users at the individual as well as social levels. This implies a responsibility of the HCI community to intervene and involve the user in the Human-Building Interaction (HBI) design practice. We propose bringing together expertise from the fields of human-computer interaction, building and urban architecture, and social sciences, and provide them with an occasion for collaboratively creating and sharing ``images' of HBI by 2030. The goal is to uncover research opportunities and challenges that will emerge through discussions and multi-faceted debates about the topics proposed.},

By bringing together leading privacy academics and commercial stakeholders, this workshop builds on previous gatherings at ACM conferences and in the broader privacy community.

Conversation will largely be centered upon a discussion of objects produced through a research through design process. Bringing together researchers as well as their physical work is a means of gaining insight into the practices and outcomes of research through design. If research through design is to continue to develop as a research practice for generating knowledge within HCI, this requires developing ways of attending to its made, material outcomes. The premise of this workshop is simple: We need additional spaces for interacting with and reflecting upon material design outcomes at CHI. The goal of this workshop is to experiment with such a space, and to initially do so without a strong theoretical or conceptual framing.},

We believe that especially in the context of HCI, collaboration with other fields can provide valuable input and create new perspectives on HCI challenges. This one-day workshop aims at bridging the gap between related disciplines in the area of personal fabrication by bringing together researchers from different fields.

abstract = {The primary focus of our workshop is on exploring ways to enable inviscid text entry on mobile devices. In inviscid text entry, it is the user's creativity that is the text-creation bottleneck rather than the text entry interface. The inviscid rate is estimated at 67 wpm while current mobile text entry methods are typically 20-40 wpm. In this workshop, participants will discuss and demonstrate early work into novel methods that allow very rapid text entry, even if such methods currently are quite error-prone. In addition to submitting a position paper, participants are strongly encouraged to bring a demo to present during the workshop's interactive Show-and-Tell session. As well as exploring new entry methods, the workshop will discuss experimental tasks and evaluation methodologies for researching inviscid text entry. Looking beyond the speed of entry, the workshop will explore often overlooked aspects of text entry such as user adaptation, post-entry correction/revision/formatting, entry of diverse types of text, and entry when a user's input or output capabilities are limited. Finally, the workshop serves to strengthen the community of text entry researchers who attend CHI, as well as provide an opportunity for new members to join this community.},

But these stores also bring with them new challenges for managing information across long periods of time. Hence personal information management (PIM) research increasingly must address the long term. For the seventh PIM workshop in a successful series started in 2005, we propose taking a look at personal information with exactly this longitudinal perspective. We expect the workshop to attract a range of people doing research related to PIM, HCI, personal digital archiving, aging, and the design of informational spaces for later life. Attendees will discuss issues related to storing information for the long run, how stored information can benefit a person throughout their lifetime (and into old age), and the legacy of a person's personal information.},

abstract = {Education is one of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of the United Nations. Considerable interest has been displayed in online education at scale, a new arising concept to realize the MDG. Yet connecting online education to real jobs is still a challenge. This CHI workshop bridges this gap by bringing together groups and insights from related work at HCOMP, CSCW, and Learning at Scale. The workshop aims at providing opportunities for groups not yet in the focus of online education, exemplified by low SES and less educated students who have not have equal access to higher education, compared to typical students in MOOCs. The focus is on theoretical and empirical connections between online education and job opportunities which can reduce the financial gap, by providing students with an income during their studies. The workshop explores the technological analogue of the concept of "apprenticeship", long established in the European Union, and education research (Collins, Seely Brown, Newman, 1989). This allows students to do useful work as an apprentice during their studies. This workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e.g., platforms similar to Upwork, Amazon Mechanical Turk); education, psychology, and MOOCs (e.g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourcing and collaborative work (e.g., attendees of CHI, CSCW, NIPS, AAAI's HCOMP).},

The eventual relief from the driving task enables a complete new area of research and practice in human-computer interaction and interaction design. In this one-day workshop, participants will explore the opportunities the design space of autonomous driving will bring to HCI researchers and designers. On the day before workshop participants are invited to visit (together with workshop organizers) Google Partnerplex and Stanford University. At Google participants will have the opportunity to explore Google's autonomous car simulator and might have the chance to experience one of the Google Cars (if available). At Stanford participants are invited to ride in a Wizard-of-Oz autonomous vehicle. Based on this first-hand experience we will discuss design approaches and prototype interaction systems during the next day's workshop.

abstract = {This one-day workshop seeks to advance the discussion around making and fabrication in HCI research, including notions of hobbyist making and industrial production. These different fabrication cultures are the starting point for the workshop, which attempts to contour the landscape of fabrication and how it influences and is influenced by HCI (research). The proposed workshop extends from two prior efforts in this space: a workshop held at the 5th Decennial Aarhus Conference and a three-day summit in Austria in September 2015 on "Rethinking Technology Innovation: Factories, Fabrication &amp; Design Research".},

abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. It involves the statistical inference of models (such as classifiers) from data. It is often conceived in a very impersonal way, with algorithms working autonomously on passively collected data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, and even deciding what should be modeled in the first place. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognising this human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human context can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of framing learning computationally. This workshop will bring together researchers to discuss these issues and suggest future research questions aimed at creating a human-centered approach to machine learning.},

abstract = {Surveillance, literally the 'close watching over' of a person or a group, was historically carried out to monitor adversaries and criminals. The digital era of sensor-rich, connected devices means that new forms of everyday surveillance -- what some are calling 'dataveillance' -- are emerging. These are changing the power structures that link people, businesses and governments. In this multidisciplinary, one day workshop, we seek to rethink and understand everyday surveillance practices, asking: what are new forms of surveillance that accompany developments in Big Data and the emerging Internet of Things; what are the anticipated and unanticipated effects of a surveillance culture; how does surveillance need to be (re)configured in order to empower the citizen or contribute to social good? We will ask who "owns" the data that arises from these everyday acts of surveillance and what can result from rethinking these ownership models. We will consider the role and place of research in surveillance data collection and analysis.},

abstract = {Being in nature is typically regarded to be calming, relaxing and purifying. When in nature, people often seek physical activity like hiking, or meditative, mindful or inspiring experiences remote from the urban everyday life. However, the modern lifestyle easily extends technology use to all sectors of our everyday life, and e.g. the rise of sports tracking technologies, mobile phone integrated cameras and omnipresent social media access have contributed to technologies also arriving into the use context of nature. Also maps and tourist guides are increasingly smart phone or tablet based services. This workshop addresses the challenges that are related to interacting with technology in nature. The viewpoints cover, but are not limited to interaction design and prototyping, social and cultural issues, user experiences that aim for unobtrusive interactions with the technology with nature as the use context},

abstract = {Traditional interfaces are continuously being replaced by mobile, wearable, or pervasive interfaces. Yet when it comes to the input and output modalities enabling our interactions, we have yet to fully embrace some of the most natural forms of communication and information processing that humans possess: speech, language, gestures, thoughts. Very little HCI attention has been dedicated to designing and developing spoken language and multimodal interaction techniques, especially for mobile and wearable devices. In addition to the enormous, recent engineering progress in processing such modalities, there is now sufficient evidence that many real-life applications do not require 100% accuracy of processing multimodal input to be useful, particularly if such modalities complement each other. This multidisciplinary, two-day workshop will bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to analyze the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions with mobile and wearable devices, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech and multimodal processing.},

For instance, could a maternal health project in India benefit from lessons learned from a project in Kenya and vice versa? How can we, as a global HCI4D community, work within countries and across them as well? The short-term goal of this event is to link research and practice across disparate HCI4D contexts by creating a forum for conversations where 'HCI4Ders' from across the globe can speak and be heard, as they develop themes of common interests, and work on potential projects or proposals to concretely target an action plan they can pursue as collaborators. Our long-term goal is to advance HCI4D research so that, as a community, we can engage more productively in research conversations that focus on learning and collaborating across borders.},

However, scaling such experiences to support multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one needs to be accompanied with a precisely-located haptic proxy object. We showcase a solution that overcomes this limitation by hacking human perception. Our framework for repurposing passive haptics, called haptic retargeting, leverages the dominance of vision when our senses conflict. With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics for multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically aligning physical and virtual objects: body manipulation, world manipulation and a hybrid technique which combines both world and body manipulation.

To explore this area, we developed the Sensation which is a control apparatus detecting the different touch types between two players. To observe the gaming experience we implemented the game, Shape Destroy, and conducted a user study with 30 participants to understand its effects on player experience. Results showed that HHST, provided by the Sensation, added to game experience boosting social, ludic and emotional aspects.},

For example, a POI may exist outside the map or on a background with no meaningful cues. To address this issue, we present Personalized Compass, a self-contained compact graphical location indicator. Personalized Compass uses personal a priori POIs to establish a reference frame, within which a POI in question can then be localized. Graphically, a personalized compass combines a multi-needle compass with an abstract overview map. We analyze the characteristics of Personalized Compass and the existing Wedge technique, and report on a user study comparing them. Personalized Compass performs better for four inference tasks, while Wedge is better for a locating task. Based on our analysis and study results, we suggest the two techniques are complementary and offer design recommendations. In this demonstration, we present an iOS application comparing Personalized Compass with Wedge for map-based location and direction tasks.},

We have developed a wearable haptic I/O device, named bioSync, that equips a developed electrode system for enabling the same electrodes to perform biosignal measurement and stimulation. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the optimal forms of a feeding spoon for people with neuromuscular disorders by reproducing muscle tremors in healthy people. Potential scenarios for achieving interactive rehabilitations and sports training are also described. It is essential for both the trainers and the learners to perceive not only the physical bodily motions but also the muscle activity.},

By installing the display on the upper side of snowboard deck, a mundane wooden board, we visualized weight distribution, which is important movement related information in snowboarding. We expect that new kinds of interaction could be developed in individual usage and lesson usages of snowboarding. The prototype was pilot-tested on an indoor ski slope and formulated the structure of a user study for future.},

To investigate and understand the impact of novel interaction techniques, content, and display properties, researchers and practitioners alike rely on observations of the audience. While in-situ observations are costly in terms of time and effort, video data allows situations in front of the display to be analyzed post-hoc. In many situations, however, video recordings are not possible since the privacy of users needs to be protected. To address this challenge, we present a tool that allows scenes in front of a display to be reconstructed from Kinect data (user position and body posture) and visualized in a virtual environment. In this way, the privacy of the audience can be preserved while allowing display owners to run in-depth investigations of their display installations.},

In order to address the challenge, we introduce DriftBoard, a panning based text entry technique in which the user types by navigating the movable QWERTY keyboard with respect to the fixed cursor point. In this paper, we describe interactions on the proposed typing system, and report a preliminary result of our user study on a watch-size touchscreen with a text copy task comparing DriftBoard to two published ultra-small keyboards, ZoomBoard (tapping-based) and Swipeboard (swiping-based). Within the user study, DriftBoard performed comparably (no significant difference) to ZoomBoard in the major metrics of text entry speed and error rate, and outperformed Swipeboard, which suggests that the proposed panning-based typing is another promising input form for text entry on ultra-small touchscreens.},

The latter option provides more flexibility, but also presents a heightened entry barrier as it often requires installation of custom software. To address these issues, M³ enables immediate interaction through the mobile browser without requiring prior setup on the user side, and real-time interaction suitable for fast multiplayer games. We present a live demonstration of our framework at the example of a public game which has already been shown to support up to 17 concurrent users. Despite a resource-constrained environment and an unpredictable selection of client devices, M³ consistently delivers performance suitable for real-time interaction.},

ReFabrication is a concept of fabrication, mixing the idea of Reuse and Digital Fabrication, which aims to fabricate new functional shape with ready made products, effectively utilizing its behavior. As a system prototype, we have implemented a design tool which enables users to gather up every day objects and reassemble them to another functional shape with taking advantages of both analog and digital fabrication. In particular, the system calculates the optimized positional relationship among objects, and generates joint objects to bond the objects together in order to achieve a certain shape.},

A machine-learning algorithm basically aims to maximize audiovisual diversity by tracking changes in systems behavior in relation to behavior in the artificial world. We suggest rewarding human-machine interaction to exist in the elaboration of dynamic relationships between spatial and cognitive human behavior and audiovisual performance in an artificial universe.},

abstract = {iMorphia combines body tracking, games engine technology and projection to create the illusion of an embodied virtual character within a virtual set. The performer wears a white costume onto which a virtual character is projected creating the illusion of a three dimensional figure, which through body tracking, closely follows the movements of the performer. Video glasses connected to a video camera enable the performer to see their transformed self from the same perspective as the audience. This shift in perspective, 'the embodied performative turn', represents a novel performative form of interaction directed at an audience whilst challenging inherent conventions of screen based interaction.},

abstract = {Distractions is a kinetic sculpture that brings together sonification and visualization in a single physical artifact. It utilizes inaudible frequencies to visualize invisible electromagnetic signals, such as those from cellphone, Wi-Fi and radio communications, that surround us in daily life. This way, the piece highlights some of our routine sources of distraction in their raw forms. By picking up the electromagnetic signals in the exhibition space, the sculpture visualizes the signals to and from the mobile devices that are brought into this space by the visitors. The sub frequency vibrations, which oscillate the structure according to the these intentional or unintentional communications, not only represent the distractions the artist faces on a regular basis, but also intercept the dialogue between the audience and the inert steady state of the sculpture. The piece therefore interacts with the audience through the distractions that draw them away from the experience of the artwork.},

Instead, they can see bright ripples through the canvases. The coins will be donated to the nearest public facilities from the exhibition. The coins outside the cup that they failed to put in will be used for growing and duplicating the project to provide more opportunities for audiences to take part in.

abstract = {Email both satisfies our cultural obsession with speed and sets the frenetic pace we obligingly follow. Our inboxes are bombarded by a torrent of messages arriving at the speed of light, demanding our urgent attention; making many of us feel trapped at terminal velocity. This extreme efficiency reverses our power relationship with technology; enslaving rather than liberating. In boredomresearch's webmail project Real Snail Mail (2008-ongoing) the artists challenge this one-dimensional 'faster is better' paradigm, by asking: Is there space in our speed obsessed world for a service that takes time? Real Snail Mail is not only slow but fragile, imperfect and unreliable - more human than machine. boredomresearch take a technology embedded in our everyday life and combines it with a biological interruption, Helix Aspersa snails (Fig 1) - allowing users to interact with the familiar on a completely new temporal scale; often provoking deep reflection. The project contributes to an on-going and critically important cultural discussion, aiming to understand our complex relationship with technology, as it fundamentally changes our experience of time itself. Insights relate to both urgent global concerns aroused by environmental, and economic turbulence, affecting us all, as well as the intimate and private relations between two individuals, as for example they negotiate the failing of everlasting love. In the words of Carl Honor\'{e}, the author of In Praise of Slow, "Real Snail Mail adds a fresh twist. It challenges the assumption that everything we write must reach its destination as fast as possible, and opens up the possibility that some missives might benefit from slower delivery."},

abstract = { 'Breaking AndyWall' is an interactive art installation in which participants can destroy various art pieces that are socially considered as 'great art'. As participants enter the site, they find Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe projected on a big painting canvas. Several wooden hammers are on the floor, and by smashing the canvas with the hammer, participants can gradually break down the art piece. When the image eventually becomes completely shattered into pixels, another piece of art will show up on the canvas. Through the same interaction, participants can destroy several famous art pieces in transgressive but playful ways. This project provides an experiential space to contribute to the discussion on the dynamic roles of users in art and design. By invoking an actual experience of destruction and reconfiguration of iconic art pieces, this project challenges the understandings around creativity and design.

While the game has stand-alone integrity as both an interactive artwork and a game, it also has the benefit of engaging players in learning about electricity. In addition to exhibiting and possibly selling the game as a completed product, we also plan to develop eBee workshops and an online set of instructables that encourage people to create their own eBees.},

abstract = {The interactive artwork Dichroic Wade explores the hybrid and concrete form of data, light and space through a colorful display of dynamic reflected and transmitted light. This light is manipulated and treated in a painterly way, where the physical manipulation of light, shadow and colour facilitates audience engagement with the hybrid data and real space. The light changes in response to both people moving through the space and data streams describing the changing wind conditions in the San Francisco Bay. The bright colour reflections on the gallery walls, ceiling and floor facilitate audience engagement with this data. It is through this interpretation of behaviours in the data that the audience is able to make new meanings, working to relate themselves to both data and their surroundings in meaningful ways.},

Now he finds himself settling into the role of "educator of practitioners": translating research for designers and developers. Come hear how the oscillation started, what the tensions are between research and practice, and how to (and NOT to) make research useful to practitioners. Some examples will come from Jeff's recent work helping practitioners design products and services for an aging population. He'll add in a few choice photos from Africa.},

abstract = {Since the dawn of the Internet era, researchers, policy-makers and the general public have questioned how new technology is influencing our psychological well-being. This talk will review research I've done with students and collaborators over the past 18 years to cast light on this question. Our earliest work in the 1990s indicated that more Internet use, independent of type, predicted increases in depression and declines in other measures of well-being. However, later research that differentiated communication with stronger from communication with weaker ties and differentiated types of communication shows that whom one communicates with online and the nature of the communication are the important factors, not Internet use per se. In Facebook, for example, receiving targeted, composed communication from strong ties predicts improvements in well-being, while viewing wide-audience broadcasts, receiving one-click feedback, and receiving composed communication from weak ties does not. In online health support groups, it is messages exchanged in public that predicts improvements in well-being, while private message exchanges predict declines.},

abstract = {As researchers, practitioners, and educators in human-computer interaction, it is important to strive for societal impact. Although it can be very enjoyable to work only within our own disciplinary communities, where we have a shared understanding and a shared history, focusing only within our own community limits the societal impact. Therefore, it is important to collaborate not only with people in other research and practitioner disciplines, but also educators, policymakers and other government officials, advocacy groups, and the broader research and development community. As we in the HCI community increase the use of Mechanical Turk, sensors, tweets, and other big data approaches for data collection, it moves us further away from interacting with the users and user communities that our design and development work impacts. We need to recommit to interacting with users, user communities, and the broader communities for whom HCI work can improve the quality of life. Our own traditions of user-centered design can lead us down this path of engagement and societal impact. In this presentation, Dr. Lazar will not only present about his research and teaching related to improving the user interaction experience for people with disabilities, but will also discuss various forms of collaboration and outreach that can improve the societal impact of our HCI work. This presentation will discuss engaging with the broader community on HCI-related topics, including 1) other disciplines, 2) advocacy groups, 3) public policy and legal communities, 4) tech transfer and corporate R and D communities, 5) educational communities (starting as early as pre-school), and 6) the towns and cities that we live in. Dr. Lazar will provide examples of his own experiences in these types of engagement, including long-term collaborations with the National Federation of the Blind, the National Down Syndrome Congress, the Maryland Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, and the Baltimore County Public Library, as well as continuous engagement with the higher education, library, legal, and public policy communities. Guidelines for performing these types of engagement will be presented.},
