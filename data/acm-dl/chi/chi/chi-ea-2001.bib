abstract = {Commuters spend a lot of time in their cars, Americans average 80 minutes per day -- much of it stuck in traffic jams. Surveys tell us that most users are interested in services and information that makes their drive safer, shorter and more enjoyable -- not reading email.Jupiter Communications[1] surveyed 2100 consumers in 1998 regarding services they would like to see in the auto. Their answers (in order of preference): directions and maps, traffic reports, weather, e-mail and arranging travel. This matches our smaller scale studies.We have been investigating how to deliver these services to drivers and have initial information to report.},

Existing instant messenger applications are a good step, but most provide minimal awareness and are not easily accessible from the road. Hubbub is an instant messenger that runs on a wireless Palm and a PC, enabling people to maintain background awareness of others and send them quick messages. It uses a novel concept of "sound instant messages," i.e., earcons that have meaning, such "Hi" or "Thanks." Each user has a Sound ID that announces their sound messages and their changes in availability. Users can protect their privacy and control sound overload.},

Rather than modifying the computer that is to be accessed, the TAS provides individuals with a personal information appliance, called an accessor, that provides alternative ways to perform all of the necessary keyboard, mouse and/or monitor functions. With this approach, disabled users can transparently use the full capabilities of any system without penalty and with whatever performance augmentation they may require to be competitive.},

abstract = {Pervasive technology devices that intend to be worn must not only meet our functional requirements but also our social, emotional, and aesthetic needs. Current pervasive devices such as the PDA or cell phone are more portable than wearable, yet still they elicit strong consumer demand for intuitive interfaces and well-designed forms. Looking to the future of wearable pervasive devices, we can imagine an even greater demand for meaningful forms for objects nestled so close to our bodies. They will need to reflect our tastes and moods, and allow us to express our personalities, cultural beliefs, and values. Digital Jewelry explores a new wearable technology form that is based in jewelry design, not in technology. Through prototypes and meaningful scenarios, digital jewelry offers new ideas to consider in the design of wearable devices.},

Among it's most useful applications we can find telephone-based information services, banking and computer assisted language learning systems.There exist already a large number of commercial products that use speech interfaces, developed mainly for English, German and Japanese. That is why we at TLATOA have focused our efforts on making this technology available in the Spanish spoken in Mexico.To this effect we perform basic research in the different speech processing techniques, trying to improve the performance of speech recognition and synthesis (artificial neural networks, hidden Markov Models (HMM's), Unit Selection, etc.), as well as, the Spanish language, dialogue structure, perception and human-computer interaction approaches, for the development of speech applications.},

A few studies have approached this issue by using interactive applications that integrate virtual reality and cognitive tasks to enhance spatial orientation skills.

Also absent are conceptual tools for detecting and describing such behavior. This research addresses these absences by closely examining how CMC design supports social interaction among distributed work groups and thus, stimulates or suppresses adoption. Contributions of this work are a principled understanding of sociotechnical issues surrounding CMC use and recommendations for design.},

While message content provides a consistent determiner of what a message is about, not being able to predict the content of unwanted messages makes filtering on content difficult. The current study interviews list moderators to gain an understanding of current practices with respect to handling flame messages and their effect on continuing discussion. A filtering tool is proposed using a multi-modal filter technique and a prototype tested in the field. A panel of experts is used to evaluate the tool's interface.},

abstract = {The aim of this research is to build adaptive interaction techniques and methods for speech user interfaces. The focus is on interaction methods which can adapt to the different users and interaction situations. This includes multilinguality, different communication strategies, robust error handling methods and complex structural elements. The research is done in the context of the Jaspis framework, which is a general architecture for speech application development. Jaspis is based on an adaptive interaction model, which includes input agents, dialogue agents and presentation agents. Using these it is possible to construct highly adaptive, modular and reusable interaction techniques for speech applications.},

The dynamic tether incorporates principles which are known from the older technique of frequency separation, and in many ways resembles a mass-spring-damper system. This study examines the effect of dynamic viewpoint tethering on human users' performance on both local guidance and global awareness tasks. The research results support the design of display systems in improving human-computer interaction in teleoperation tasks.},

At present, subjective assessment is used to do this, however it has drawbacks when used in isolation. Therefore, this research approach is utilising physiological indicators of stress to measure the impact of media quality on users - this is defined as user cost. Four studies using this technique have shown that physiological responses to audio and video degradations can be detected and that they do not always correlate with subjective results. Subsequently, a three-tier approach to multimedia quality evaluation is proposed, which incorporates task performance, user satisfaction and user cost.},

We believe that understanding the requirements of prospective memory should lead to the design of email tools that better support this functionality. In a recent study, we examined prospective email use and explored processes involved in managing time-sensitive email messages. The study results indicated areas that lack appropriate support for handling future actions in email. The study also found relationships between prospective email usage and users' organization habits. We draw on research in prospective memory to guide the design of email tools that will provide better support for handling future actions.},

abstract = {We describe an inertial gesture recognition framework composed of three parts. The first is a compact, six-axis inertial measurement unit to fully measure human motion. The data from this unit is then analyzed by a gesture recognition algorithm which considers data on an axis-by-axis basis and categorizes them as simple motions (line, twist, etc.) with magnitude and duration. An application designer can then combine these atoms together both concurrently and consecutively to create composite gestures which can be tied to output routines. The framework was implemented on a Palm III to demonstrate its light-weight nature and to evoke devices which possess both a sense of their own motion and the ability to respond to it},

Before building the tool that we present here, we built a paper and an interactive prototype and tested the prototypes with a total of fifteen users. We also interviewed six professional speech UI designers at their workplace about their current design practice. These designers encouraged us to build a tool that lets them start with examples when designing and simulate recognition error during testing.

The need for guidance is especially pressing because information architecture is an emerging field.

These fields have widely varying opinions on the validity of and techniques for quantifying information system performance. While some dispute the validity of quantification, others tend to believe that it is not only possible but the only valid means for assessing information architecture. Members of both camps may resort to traditional means of assessing information systems performance, while others feel that the new medium of the Web requires new tools, techniques, and approaches for such assessment.},

It's also for people with upper-body disabilities, lack of fine muscle control, or severe arthritis, all of which can make the reading of standard paper books difficult. The force-free sensor system can be adjusted for large-scale motion or for tiny ranges of movement, and requires no pressure or fiddling with physical objects. The sensors read the proximity of a human limb, and adjust parameters on the text accordingly. For example, the reading device can be controlled with the motion of one finger if necessary, or adjusted to read the motion of an entire arm or leg.},

Handhelds are a relatively inexpensive, highly mobile platform, making them potentially useful in educational settings [3]. Two shortcomings of students' use of handhelds are: 1) achieving the benefits of collaborative learning may be difficult given the personal nature of these devices, and 2) the small size of a PDA constrains the amount of information that can be meaningfully displayed. We address these shortcomings by utilizing multiple devices to form a larger surface that can display more information than any individual handheld. This interaction technique encourages collaboration and helps engage all students in the activity. To explore this style of collaboration, we extended an educational application with a shared screen information view that we call WHAT-IF1.},

On one hand, subjects learned almost all tutored commands, regardless of their relevance to their immediate activities, and rarely learned commands that had not been tutored. On the other hand, subjects were very enthusiastic about relevant tutoring and were frustrated when it seemed random: they felt it was an irritating interruption.

In use, a detector circuit identifies the active page by noting the highest page in the stack not exhibiting a resistance change. In volume, this method provides an inexpensive, simple solution to page detection. The person uses the paper pad naturally, not needing to tell the system when a new page is being viewed.

Users were asked to browse several web sites while their eye/mouse movements were recorded. The data suggest that there is a strong relationship between gaze position and cursor position. The data also show that there are regular patterns of eye/mouse movements. Based on these findings, we argue that a mouse could provide us more information than just the x, y position where a user is pointing. This implies that we can use an inexpensive and extremely popular tool as an alternative of eye-tracking systems, especially in web usability evaluation. Moreover, by understanding the intent of every mouse movement, we may be able to achieve a better interface for human computer interaction.},

Although heuristic evaluation is a cost-effective method for evaluating interfaces, we found that the recommended prioritization strategy--ranking the problems according to severity--has several limitations. Specifically, it does not address how much it will cost the developers to fix the problems, nor does it adequately capture the distinction between high-level (global) and low-level (specific, screen-level) problems. To address these limitations, we developed a method which retains the richness of heuristic evaluation, but communicates the results in such a way that project managers, developers, and designers can form a clear and immediately executable plan for addressing the problems. Our method integrates user research, heuristic evaluation, affinity diagramming, cost-benefit charts, and recommendations into a report that others can use to plan both short and long-term improvements.},

A computer recognizes the 3D structure of connected cubes in real time by utilizing the real-time communication network among cubes. Also, ActiveCube is equipped with both input and output devices, at where the user expects to be, and this makes the interface intuitive and helps to clarify the causal relationship between the input of the user's operational intention and the output of simulated results.

This hypothesis was investigated by comparing three interfaces that presented text, text plus static graphics, or text plus animated graphics.

In this paper we describe an experiment using online manipulations of traditional paper comic books to a) evaluate the effectiveness of different online presentations of a traditional entertainment medium and b) contrast systematic evaluation methods for assessing entertainment value. Paper comic books were transferred online and manipulated in two ways: the degree of user control in advancing through the story ("user control") and the amount of the original page presented on the screen at a one time ("visual scope"). We used a combination of methods to measure entertainment value: pre and post questionnaires, active experience surveys, facial expression analysis, heart rate measurement and time spent on the interface. From this study, it was determined that the most successful way of presenting comic books online is by giving the user full control over the navigation ("manual" condition), and by presenting each comic book page panel by panel ("panel in page" condition). The most effective and practical way for assessing entertainment value, according to the results of this study, is the use of post questionnaires, and either active experience surveys or facial expression analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents the preliminary results from an ongoing research project with the purpose to explore possible ways of using and benefiting from mobile technology for home-help service.It is based upon a field study of three Swedish home-help service units. The project aims at an understanding of the work practices of the home-help service. The paper shows that the informal communication is an important practice in the work, but not always sufficient. This is exemplified by an episode with a caretaker. The incident implies that the practice of informal communication possibly could benefit from mobile technology.},

Subjects placed slightly more confidence in the recommendations of the population averages algorithm. Both algorithms were over-confident compared to subjects ratings. Subjects found both recommender systems to be an effective source of finding entertainment. User responses did not reveal a noticeable difference between the two algorithms.},

These two measures are tested empirically and shown to be valid and robust.Additionally, we demonstrate the use of exact mouse location for disambiguation and the use of estimated movement continuation for predicting intended target objects at early stages of the pointing gesture.},

The information curtain is a seemingly ordinary textile that can change color and pattern dynamically according to some input data. This was achieved by creating a special textile based on fibers that change color according to the amount of ultra-violet (UV) light. A color will appear on the surface when exposed to UV light and then slowly fade away when the light is turned off. By connecting the fabric to a computer-controlled UV light we will be able to use textiles as an output for digital media.},

abstract = {Mobile telephony adoption is on the rise, with industry projections suggesting that wireless subscribers will reach 1 billion worldwide by 2002 [3]. Recent technological innovations have also dramatically enhanced the capabilities of the wireless telephone [8]. No longer restricted to voice communications, wireless devices are now also able to transmit and manipulate data. Leveraging the power of these new technologies, various business sectors are working together to offer a wide array of services, including voice communications, short messaging, information services, web surfing, location-based services, and e-commerce. Each sector is looking for the next "killer application," yet we are still learning about people's information and communication needs while "on the go" [9, 10, 11]. Additionally, it is difficult to anticipate what new possibilities or challenges are created for the user upon the introduction of these new computational capabilities. An understanding of these issues is critical to the CHI community's ability to produce good technology -- technology that is innovative, useful, usable, and profitable.},

abstract = {New concepts for human-computer interaction have to be developed when envisioning ubiquitous computing scenarios [7]. Instead of a single screen-based user interface (UI), humans will interact with a number of devices that are distributed and interconnected. These computers range from highly personal and mobile appliances to systems that are integrated in everyday environments and are more or less invisible. When all the potential components are considered together, the design space for the UI becomes much larger than with conventional personal computers. In the process of designing UIs, decisions on the distribution of the input as well as the output through both space and time are needed. This also raises questions on how to deal with alternative, multiple input options, redundant output opportunities, and the fact that many of these UIs cannot expect to have people's attention for a long time.},

While quantitative results such as task completion time and satisfaction ratings are straightforward to analyze and report, qualitative findings are less so. Qualitative findings encompass defects or flaws introduced at various stages of development, user suggestions for improving an acceptable design, and more diffuse usability concerns that need further investigation.It is not sufficient for usability engineers to simply identify usability defects. These defects must be communicated, tracked, resolved, and reported on. The effectiveness of a usability engineering process can be measured by its success rate in causing legitimate usability issues to be successfully resolved. This workshop will seek to identify best practices for managing usability defects from the time they are identified to the time they are closed.},

abstract = {Many aspects of Mark Weiser's original vision of ubiquitous computing [3] are rapidly becoming reality. Unlike just a few years ago, where we had at most one computer per person, many of us now routinely carry several "intelligent" devices. These may include PDAs, cell phones, laptop computers, portable digital music players, and so on. Additionally, our daily environments are often inhabited by digital devices such as computer display projectors and computer-augmented whiteboards.Increasingly, these devices have the ability to interconnect with one another, whether through short-range, proximity-based transports such as infrared or Bluetooth, via longer-range wireless technology, or through "traditional" wired networks. As we carry with us and are surrounded by increasing numbers of interconnectable devices--as well as rapidly proliferating interconnected software services--we are confronted with the question: how will we understand, make sense of, and ultimately use, the functionality around us?},

abstract = {The increasing success and popularity of the Internet makes this a critical time to examine elements that can cause online user interactions to be a success or a dismal failure. One of the most important of these elements, trust, has been identified as critical in ensuring a successful online interaction (Cheskin, 2000; Egger, 2000; Stratford, 2000). Human trust is essential for effective online experiences in part because these systems eliminate or minimize face-to-face contact. Online interface designers are also interested in trust as it relates to their ability to design elements into their websites that engender trust on the part of their users. They require knowledge about what goes into building an online trust relationship with a user which they can use to facilitate this process. While the importance of online trust is recognized, its study is just beginning. Questions such as 'what exactly is online trust?' and 'What makes a website trustworthy?' are some of the key issues in the study of online trust. We have identified two online contexts upon which to focus during the workshop. These are: ecommerce and health care information systems.},
