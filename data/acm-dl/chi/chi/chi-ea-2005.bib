abstract = {This paper discusses the redesign of PeopleSoft's Enterprise Expenses product from a product that was notorious for it's complexity into a product that was both usable and one of PeopleSoft's best selling products. The process used was a combination of best practices from user-centered design, business and marketing to deliver a usable application on a pure-html "no-code on the client" platform. The design effort was also a collaboration of design, usability engineers, business strategy, functional analysts and developers (and of course our customers!) At the same time, the process needed to track the competing interests of various stakeholders: clients, their end users, their business processes, our technical requirements, our limited resources and our internal stakeholders. The designed solution had to work within a framework that could not be re-written. A poorly working metaphor was redefined into a concept that would work better with the end-users.},

abstract = {In a student project over the summer of 2004 teams of computer science and product design students worked together to develop new forms of interfaces for media control in living room contexts. In this paper we describe the design process from collecting first ideas of design choices and iteratively evolving (low- fidelity) prototypes to fully functional products, partially even meeting mass production requirements. We discuss how the interdisciplinary collaboration influenced the creative process in such a way, that the solutions were more realistic than purely design- informed solutions and more inspired than purely technology- informed ones. We experienced that the combination of skills lead to a much more focused design process, which produced fully functional prototypes in a short time. The resulting designs include one interface installed in the room, two autonomous interaction objects which can be freely moved around, and a two- handed inter- face. While these are only small spotlights into a large design space, they nicely show the possible diversity. We also learned that fully functional and aesthetically pleasing prototypes can be developed with technologically relatively simple means.},

Two products, PRISM and LOTIS, and their interrelated design processes are described in this paper. PRISM (Presentation and Interaction with Streaming media) automates the creation of online learning materials by integrating streaming digital video, wireless concept testing, an annotation system, and face-to-face peer interaction. LOTIS (the Learning Object Tagging and Information System) catalogues and packages instructional resources using a combination of intelligent agents and customized metadata templates. The result is a model for dynamic content creation that lays the foundation for design improvements based on students' access to and interaction with instructional materials.},

The team leveraged prior work on navigation for Cisco's public web site, created and tested a series of prototypes, and integrated the final design with an innovative template framework. The result was better navigation, increased relevancy, and reduced costs.},

The users were also completely unfamiliar with the task and in a very stressful environment. Therefore, unlike most commercial software interfaces that "tell" users how to complete a task by relying on entry fields labels and controls, or use language to provide context for tasks, we need to "show" users how to interact with interface. The goals for our user interface are similar to the goals of arcade video game machines that use a short demonstration video, without words, to draw the viewer's attention, create an expectation in the viewer of what is to come, and demonstrate the task to the viewer. User testing found that demonstration videos could meet these requirements.},

Outside of the drawing canvas, the brush can pick up colors, textures, and movements of a brushed surface. On the canvas, artists can draw with the special "ink" they just picked up from their immediate environment.

These laws impose a certain speed ceiling on precise actions in a user interface. My hypothesis is that for some interfaces, the constraints of these laws can be relaxed by using context information of the task. To support this thesis, I present two systems I have developed for pen-based text input on stylus keyboards. These systems break either Fitts' law or the Law of crossing by taking advantage of high-resolution information from the pen, and the fact that words can be seen as patterns traced on the keyboard. Using these systems users can potentially gain higher text entry speed than on a regular stylus keyboard that is limited by the laws of action. I conclude by discussing planned future research, primarily improved visual feedback and empirical evaluation.},

Although these interfaces offer the promise of ease of use, they are currently more difficult to build than traditional ones. The aim of this research is to simplify the task of developing reality-based interfaces and adapting them to a changing landscape of resources. This goal will be accomplished by providing developers with a high level user interface description language (UIDL) and a user interface management system (UIMS) which describes and enables to develop these interfaces given the uncertainty of the input-output devices they will employ.},

Such errors can be minimized by designing interaction protocols in which users are required to speak in a standardized way, but this requirement presents additional difficulties: this way of speaking can be unnatural for users, and in order to learn the standardized interface, users must spend time in tutorial mode rather than in task mode. I propose a strategy of shaping that helps users adapt their interaction to match what the system understands best, thereby reducing the chance for misunderstandings and improving interaction efficiency.},

abstract = {The goal of my proposed thesis is to examine the role of working memory in processing route guidance information while driving. I will also assess how changes in the presentation and processing of route guidance and secondary task information influences the primary task of vehicle control. Results will be analyzed in terms of whether a change of route navigation presentation from visual to auditory will change the memory resources used to process the information. Furthermore, analyses will be done to assess whether changes in the processing of route navigation and secondary task information affect driving performance. To examine what working memory subsystems (i.e., phonological, visual, spatial, central executive) are used to process visual versus auditory route guidance information, the present research will require participants to drive a driving simulator while performing a route navigation task and a secondary working memory task. Performance of these secondary tasks will permit us to assess demands of route navigation tasks upon the various working memory subsystems. Accordingly, participants will retain a memory load while performing the route navigation tasks. This research is expected to raise significant HCI implications for the design of safer interfaces for vehicles and provide much needed detail about how specific mental codes and processes are involved in processing route navigation information.},

Our contextual interviews show that DJs use a significant amount of their time on tracking and synchronizing songs using the traditional setup with turntables or CD players. By making beat information an integrated part of our DJ software Mixxx, synchronization is done automatically and DJs can use more time to attend other parts of the mix.

Essentially, it is a smart rangefinder scanner that instead of continuously scanning over the full field of view restricts its scanning area, on the basis of a real-time analysis of the backscattered signal, to a very narrow window precisely the size of the target. The complexity of the whole setup is equivalent to that of a portable laser-based barcode reader, making the system compatible with wearable computers.},

Game environments are dynamic and highly unpredictable; lighting such experiences to achieve desired visual goals is a very challenging problem. Current lighting methods rely on static manual techniques, which require designers to anticipate and account for all possible situations and user actions. Alternatively, we have developed ELE (Expressive Lighting Engine) -- an intelligent lighting system that automatically sets and adjusts scene lighting in real-time to achieve desired aesthetic and communicative goals. In this paper, we discuss ELE and its utility in dynamically manipulating the lighting in a scene to direct attention, stimulate tension, and maintain visual continuity. ELE has been integrated within Unreal Tournament 2003. The videos shown at [14] shows a demonstration of a first person shooter game developed using the Unreal 2.0 engine, where ELE was configured to dynamically stimulate tension, while maintaining other visual goals.},

abstract = {In this demonstration, we introduce "curve dial" a technique designed to extend gesture-based interactions like FlowMenus with eyes-free parameter entry. FlowMenus, let users enter numerical parameters with "dialing" strokes surrounding the center of a radial menu. This centering requires users to keep their eyes on the Menu in order to align the pen with its center before initiating a gesture. Curve dial instead tracks the curvature of the path created by the pen: since curvature is location-independent, curvature dialging does not require users to keep track of the menu center and is therefore eyes-free. We demonstrate curvature dial with the example of a simple application that allows users to scroll through a document eyes-free.},

As user demand for access to large quantities of data increases, and cable companies offer more choices to their audiences, traditional content selection techniques become less useful and much more difficult to understand. TRIBA is the result of a ten week research and design exploration investigating how users can easily manipulate and comprehend tremendously large data sets. The findings of this research indicate a need for utilizing interactive agents to bridge the gap between the user and their goal. As technology is created and consumer electronics becomes more integrated into our lives, devices speak a language that users are expected to learn. TRIBA is a product embracing the philosophical idea that users should not have to learn a new language to interact with a futuristic and useful product, but instead products and devices must learn to speak the same language as the user.},

For example, one could consider the role of album covers in music appreciation. Previous efforts at making music interaction more tangible have focused mainly on access issues. A case study is presented in which several content attributes of Mp3 formatted music as well as control access are made more visible and tangible. Play lists, music rhythm, volume, and navigational feedback were communicated via multicolored light displayed in a tangible interface. Users were able to physically interact with music collections via the MusicCube, a wireless cube-like object, using gestures to shuffle music and a rotary dial with a button for song navigation and volume control. Speech and non-speech feedback were given to communicate current mode and song title. The working prototype was compared to an Apple iPod, along the dimensions of trust, engagement, ergonomic and hedonic qualities, and appeal. Subjects rated the MusicCube higher on scales associated with hedonic qualities, while the iPod was preferred for ergonomic qualities. Results on trust measures were found to correlate with ergonomic qualities, while sense of engagement related to hedonic aspects. Subjects generally valued the expressive and tangible interaction with music collections. Next design steps will focus on increasing ergonomic aspects of the MusicCube while maintaining a high hedonic rating.},

Rather, it was linearly dependent on the distance to the target, suggesting a constant maximum scrolling speed.

Mathematics notations have evolved to aid visual thinking and yet text-based interfaces relying on keyboard-and-mouse input do not take advantage of the natural two-dimensional aspects of math. Due to its similarities to paper-based mathematics, pen-based handwriting input may be faster, more efficient, and more preferable for entering mathematics on computers. This paper presents an empirical study that tests this hypothesis. We also explored a multimodal input method combining handwriting and speech because we hypothesize that it may enhance computer recognition and aid user cognition. Novice users were indeed faster, more efficient and enjoyed the handwriting modality more than a standard keyboard-and-mouse mathematics interface, especially as equation length and complexity increased. The multimodal handwriting-plus-speech method was faster and better liked than the keyboard-and-mouse method and was not much worse than handwriting alone.},

We thus use head tracking to switch the mouse pointer between monitors and use the mouse to move within each monitor. In our experiment users required significantly less mouse movement with the tracking system, and preferred using it, although task time actually increased. A graphical prompt (flashing star) prevented the user losing the pointer when switching monitors. We present discussions on our results and ideas for further developments.},

Using 2 x 2 factorial design, and a Wizard of Oz scenario, half the participants interacted with a system that adapted on the basis of the user's emotional expression and half were told the system could react to their emotional expressions. We established that when using an apparently affective system, users perform significantly better and report themselves as feeling significantly happier. We also discuss behavioral responses to the different conditions. These results are relevant to the design of future affective systems.},

abstract = {Large high-resolution screens are becoming increasingly available and less expensive. This creates potential advantages for data visualization in that more dense data and fine details are viewable at once. Also, less navigation may be needed to see more data. However, little work has been done to determine the effectiveness of large high-resolution displays, especially for basic low-level data visualization and navigation tasks. This paper describes an exploratory study on the effects of a large tiled display with a resolution of 3840x3072 as compared to two smaller displays (1560x2048 and 1280x1024). We conclude that, with finely detailed data, higher resolution displays that use physical navigation significantly outperform smaller displays that use pan and zoom navigation. Qualitatively, we also conclude that use of the larger display is less stressful and creates a better sense of confidence than the smaller displays.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on enabling interactions with large public displays using the most ubiquitous personal computing device, the mobile phone. Two new interaction techniques are introduced that use the embedded camera on mobile phones as an enabling technology. The "Point &amp; Shoot" technique allows users to select objects using visual codes to set up an absolute coordinate system on the display surface instead of tagging individual objects on the screen. The "Sweep" technique enables users to use the phone like an optical mouse with multiple degrees of freedom and allows interaction without having to point the camera at the display. Prototypes of these interactions have been implemented and evaluated using modern mobile phone technologies. This proof of concept provides a performance baseline and gives valuable insights to guide future research and development. These techniques are intended to inspire and enable new classes of large public display applications.},

abstract = {The Restricted Focus Viewer (RFV) relates a small part of an otherwise blurred display to the focus of visual attention. A user controls which part of the screen is in focus by using a computer mouse. The RFV tool records these movements. Recently, some studies used the RFV to investigate the cognitive behavior of users and some others have even enhanced the tool for research of usability issues.We report on an eye-tracking study where the effects of RFV's display blurring on the visual attention allocation of 18 novice and expert programmers were investigated. We replicated a previous RFV-based study and analyzed attention switching and fixation durations reported by an eye tracker. Our results indicate that the blurring interferes with the strategies possessed by experts and has an effect on fixation duration: however, we found that debugging performance was preserved. We discuss possible reasons and implications.},

abstract = {Multiple-monitor computer configurations significantly increase the distances that users must traverse with the mouse when interacting with existing applications, resulting in increased time and effort. We introduce the Multi-Monitor Mouse (M3) technique, which virtually simulates having one mouse pointer per monitor when using a single physical mouse device. M3 allows for conventional control of the mouse within each monitor's screen, while permitting immediate warping across monitors when desired to increase mouse traversal speed. We report the results of a user study in which we compared three implementations of M3 and two cursor placement strategies. Our results suggest that using M3 significantly increases interaction speed in a multi-monitor environment. All eight study participants strongly preferred M3 to the regular mouse behavior.},

Survey results indicate the eight subjects who completed the pilot study (aged 62-82) found the agent very easy to interact with, even though most of them had little or no previous experience using computers. Most subjects also indicated strong liking for and trust in the agent, felt that their relationship with the agent was more similar to a close friend than a stranger, and expressed a strong desire to continue working with the agent at the end of the study.

This study had two parts, both involving bar-coded cards, a bar-code scanner, and a projector. One part emphasized a creative, synthesis-oriented design activity. The other part emphasized a decision-making design activity.We learned that our method of designing the physical cards and the variance in the types of information we included on the cards significantly affected the collaborative behaviors. We also learned that the extension of interactivity from the digital to the physical world and back again successfully scaffolded both creative and decision-making activities in our context, although with some very notable differences in interactive behaviors between the specific activities. This latter point notwithstanding, we learned that allowing high-resolution, small size physical cards to be arrayed and manipulated on a shared surface matters much more for the purposes of scaffolding the collaborative activities than the ability to scan and project large-size, low-resolution facsimiles of the same information, in specific contexts of collaborative story-creation and decision making.},

Unfortunately, for the average user, the initial experience of setting up and using some of the newest and most interesting digital home devices is challenging, at best, and impossible for many. This paper describes a unique research technique that has been used to create tools that predict the end-users' experience when setting up and using a variety of products (Lind &amp; Michalak, 2001; Lind &amp; Michalak, 2002). Most recently, we applied this approach to a new category of products called "Digital Media Adapters" (DMAs). As with its predecessors, this tool not only allows the prediction of an end-users' experience but provides guidance on how to improve their experience.},

Once information can be projected anywhere in the space, it becomes crucial to design the information to make optimal use of users' attention. We have prototyped and evaluated a real-world augmented reality kitchen where user-centered interfaces and displays can be projected anywhere in the space to improve its usability. The augmented environment is designed to support the activities of a variety of people in diverse kitchen environments.This paper presents five intelligent kitchen systems that layer useful interfaces onto the refrigerator, range, cabinets, countertops and sink. The interface design is driven by human factors, especially attention theory and user evaluations. By projecting interfaces where they require the least cognitive load, we hope to improve the performance and confidence of users. The design employs cueing and search principles from attention theory. We present the results of pilot studies and future directions for our work.},

This paper presents a case study presenting multiple such context-aware interaction improvements in a sink. We have identified opportunities where automated interfaces at the sink have positive consequences for safety, hygiene and ecology. The danger of scalding oneself with hot water is confronted by transforming the water into a graphical user interface and using image understanding to dispense the proper temperature of water. Audio-visual feedback at the sink can motivate users to conserve water. Used in combination with an RFID reader, the sink can serve as an effective means of verifying hand-washing compliance for clean environments. Finally, automatic actuation of the sink's height based on the user and task can prevent burns and ergonomic injuries. This project demonstrates that the integration of digital interaction in a hostile environment can facilitate and improve our daily rituals.},

We found that frequent social cues and natural Human-Human syntax condition the verbal interaction of both groups with ECAs. Multimodality accounted for 21% of inputs: it was used for integrating conversational and social aspects (by speech) into task-oriented actions (by pen). We closely examined temporal and semantic integration of modalities: most of the time, speech and gesture overlapped and produced complementary or redundant messages; children also tended to produce concurrent multimodal inputs, as a way of doing several things at the same time. Design implications of our results for multimodal bidirectional ECAs and game systems are discussed.},

In two usability studies with different tasks, participants on average corrected 89 and 95 percent of their typographical and grammatical errors that they identified. However, their self-correction rates were substantially lower and more variable when compared to all errors found by independent proofreaders. The results from the second measurement showed that participants were aware of their own errors. They judged their own error rate to be significantly higher than the other person's even when that was not true. Using the third measure, correction rates in IM were found to be lower than "normal" typing. The self-sensitivity to errors prompts further investigation of techniques for error detection and correction appropriate for IM's rapid pace and relaxed linguistic register.},

To this end, I analyzed the blogs and blogging habits of eight participants using a quantitative analysis tool that I developed, a diary study, and interviews with each participant. Results suggest that authors of topical blogs often do not create new content but strive to, often follow journalistic conventions, use the content of their blogs as a reference tool for other work practices, and are connected as a community by a set of source documents. Results also show that Instant Messaging is useful as an interview medium when questions center around online content.},

By interviewing and observing Criminal Intelligence Officers (CIO) and civilian crime analysts at the Tucson Police Department (TPD), we found that two types of tasks are important for crime analysis: crime pattern recognition and criminal association discovery. We developed two separate systems that provide automatic visual assistance on these tasks. To help identify crime patterns, a Spatial Temporal Visualization (STV) system was designed to integrate a synchronized view of three types of visualization techniques: a GIS view, a timeline view and a periodic pattern view. The Criminal Activities Network (CAN) system extracts, visualizes and analyzes criminal relationships using spring-embedded and blockmodeling algorithms.

abstract = {Immersion is recognised as an important element of good games. However, it is not always clear what is meant by immersion. Earlier work has identified possible barriers to immersion including a lack of coherence between different aspects of the game. Building on this work, we designed an experiment to examine people's expectations of how a game should behave and what would happen if that behaviour was deliberately made to be incoherent. The idea then is to understand immersion through seeing how immersion can be broken. The main manipulation was to alter the behaviour and realism of the graphics in the course of a simple game situation. Surprisingly, results indicated that participants could be so immersed within a simple environment such that even significant changes in behaviour had little effect on the level of immersion. In some cases, the attempted disruptions went completely unnoticed. These results suggest that immersion within an application can overcome effects which are completely against user expectations.},

We developed the Sparks system as a physical alternative to existing connectedness mediator systems. While several systems are under investigation, they are limited by their confinement to the traditional display. We address this issue, in part, by collocating the visualization and the user within the physical environment of the scenario. We describe the specific aspects of the system that capitalize on both foreground and peripheral attention to facilitate communication throughout a conversation. We discuss our ongoing research where architectural surfaces are used to provide interactive layers of information related to elements present in the space, and conclude with a discussion of the benefits of the system in combining the immediacy of the physical environment with the dynamic data handling characteristics of a digital system.},

abstract = {Our Translation Assistant applies common sense logic to the problem of translating speech in real time from one language to another. Using speech recognition combined with a software translator to do word-by-word translation is not feasible because speech recognition is notorious for poor results. Word-by-word translation requires grammatically correct input to translate accurately. Therefore, translation of speech that is potentially already fraught with errors is not expected to be good. Our Translation Assistant works around these problems by using the context of the conversation as a basis for translation. It takes the location and the speaker as input to establish the circumstances. Then it uses a common sense knowledge network to do topic-spotting using key words from the conversation. It only translates the most likely topics of conversation into the target language. This system does not require perfect speech recognition, yet enables end-users to have a sense of the conversation.},

Some applications, such as instant messaging have partially addressed this problem with status and away messages, but this approach offers limited communication options and only works for this communication channel. Following a user-centered design approach, we explored the needs of users to manage their communication channels. Using diaries, observations, and directed story-telling interviews we generated a set of observed needs. We then generated concept scenarios that capture these needs and performed a concept validation with a focus group looking for an overlap between our observed needs and the focus groups perceived needs. This paper documents our findings and offers implications for designers addressing these communication needs.},

The latter two are separate, since iteration requires skills and knowledge beyond those typically available to evaluators. Value-centred development adds new activities and artifacts to existing development methodologies. Opportunity identification has the goal of stating the intended value for a digital product or service. Value delivery scenarios refocus design on value in the world, as does value impact analysis for evaluation.

A user study showed that subjects perceived a difference in vibration intensity under loaded conditions with and without our compensation system, indicating the usefulness of such a feedback system on influencing perception.

Overall, the 'Heuristic Evaluation of Ambient Displays' was effective - 75% of known usability problems were found by eight evaluators (39-55% were found by 3-5 evaluators). However, the most severe usability problem found in the in situ evaluation was not identified in the heuristic evaluation. Because the problem directly violated one of the heuristics, we believe that the problem is not with the heuristics, but rather that evaluators have minimal experience with ambient displays for the home.},

From these data the user's gait can be derived, and this is then used to investigate preferred tapping behaviour relative to gait phase, and associated tap accuracy. Results showed that users were more accurate sitting than walking. When walking there were phase regions with significantly increased tap likelihood, and these regions had significantly lower error rates, and lower error variability. This work represents an example of accelerometer-instrumented mobile usability analysis, and the results give a quantitative understanding of the detailed interactions taking place when on the move, allowing us to develop better mobile interfaces.},

Our data also suggest that managers create "relationship-oriented" categories more often than non-managers. These results are relevant to research on "email overload" that has highlighted the use of email for activities beyond communication.

MMM2 leverages the point of capture and of sharing to gather metadata, and uses metadata to support sharing. Based on the early results of the first 6 weeks of a six-month trial involving 60 users, indications are that with MMM2 users are actively capturing and sharing photos. The ability to automatically upload photos from a cameraphone to a web-based photo management application and to automatically suggest sharing recipients at the time of capture based on Bluetooth-sensed co-presence and sharing frequency promise to reduce the current difficulty of mobile media sharing.},

Yet, research rarely examines issues concerning the interface to webcast systems, another form of multimedia system. This paper focuses specifically on how stored webcasts are re-used. Sixteen participants performed three typical information tasks using ePresence, a webcasting system that handles both live and stored video, and contains several tools: a video window, a timeline of the webcast, slides used by the presenter, and a moderator-generated table of contents, that facilitate user access to the intellectual content of a stored video. Use takes place at the level of the webcast, and our analysis assessed user interactivity. The results showed that different types of tasks need different strategies and tools.},

Nemesys is based on an artificial neural network and is able to learn six basic emotional states. The elicitation of emotions is based on models drawn from the state of the art in modeling emotions in the field of psychology. Further the described framework includes the Five-Factor Model of Personality to represent different agent personalities.Nemesys (called after Nemesis, the Greek goddess of righteous anger) is designed to perform in various types of interfaces. The usage of Nemesys is presented with an application scenario employing a commercial 3D game-engine. Additionally a critical review of the current elicitation behavior of Nemesys is presented and discussed.},

This showed that the contents of the discussion forum were easily grasped when using a treemap, even though there were in excess of one hundred threads. In particular our technique showed a significant improvement in time for finding the largest and most active threads. Overall, it was shown that the benefits derived from using treemaps on desktop computers are still valid for small screens.},

It provided a personalized report to attendees based on publication and citation information. The report was intended to provide concrete insights into the relationship-network that could be acted upon. Results of a survey showed that 52% of responders used their report to recognize and talk to others or plan which talks to attend.

From this Glimpse state, users can undo their action as easily as they can commit to it, making Glimpse most appropriate for systems in which the user is likely to try out many variations of an edit before finding the right one. Exploration is encouraged as the cumbersome returning to a menu or keyboard to issue an Undo command is eliminated. Glimpse has the added benefits that the negative effects of inconsistencies in the Undo feature within an application are reduced.},

Already at short durations, music combined with speech was favored to silence. A preference test regarding several non-speech waiting cues proposed in literature suggests that music is preferred to more simple synthetic sounds and to natural sounds. The continuous indication of the remaining waiting time by speech was rated as much more pleasant and appropriate than a non-speech audio progress meter. Commercial announcements and navigational advice during waiting times were not accepted by the subjects. Empirically based guidelines for a maximum waiting duration in voice services is given.

Rather than enforcing a more strict TA procedure, we describe Cooperative Usability Testing (CUT), where test users and evaluators join expertise to understand the usability problems of the application evaluated. CUT consists of two sessions. In the interaction session, the test user tries out the application to uncover potential usability problems while the evaluators mainly observe, e.g. as in TA or contextual inquiry. In the interpretation session, evaluators and test users discuss what they consider the most important usability problems, supported by a video of the interaction session. In an exploratory study comparing CUT to TA, seven evaluators find that interpretation sessions contribute important usability information compared to TA. Also test users found participation in the interpretation session interesting.},

There are various accessibility evaluation tools, and they also help Web authors make their pages compliant with guidelines. As a result, an increasing number of Web pages are compliant with the evaluation tools. These days, however, blind people face the serious problem that reading Web pages is quite difficult. Improvements in information density by using visual effects such as two-dimensional layouts are making it difficult for blind people to understand the page structure. Also, inappropriate alternative texts mislead or confuse blind users.In this paper, to evaluate these kinds of usability problems, we introduce two metrics: navigability and listenability. Navigability evaluates how well structured the Web content is by using headings, intra-page links, labels, etc. Listenability denotes how appropriate the alternative texts are. By using these metrics, we summarize the historical transition of Web usability for blind people.},

It also requires a significant amount of visual searching to find a needed letter on a key. Fortunately, newer methods based on Multitap (such as LetterWise) have been shown to increase users' text entry efficiency. This paper presents an enhanced Multitap method that uses predictive next-letter highlighting to aid visual searching. Testing shows that this method, when compared to LetterWise, offers increased text entry speeds, fewer errors, and greater novice user satisfaction.},

The approach we have taken relies on families of cognitive models that interleave cognition, perception, and action at the 1/3 to 3 sec timescale. This is the level of analysis where embodied cognition forms interactive routines that adapt to the cost-benefit structure of the software tool.

abstract = {We examined the efficacy of providing dimensional feedback in the user interface as people construct business rules. Business rules often involve objects that have dimensions (e.g., area, cost, weight) and may entail complex calculations on these objects. Such mathematical expressions are error prone. We designed and tested a novel interface utilizing dimensional analysis to provide advice on expected dimensions, and error feedback on incorrect usage of dimensional objects. Experimental studies were carried out in which subjects used the interface to create rules based on word problems. In a balanced design, rule creation with dimensional feedback was compared to rule creation without such feedback. We found evidence for the usefulness of such feedback. In addition we observed the need to support higher level 'proxy variables' and stepwise definition of complex rules. The findings have implications beyond business rules tools and may be applied to any system requiring mathematical expressions with dimensional objects.},

abstract = {Several experimental studies have shown the usefulness of computers for autism, but software design remains poorly documented. Our multidisciplinary research focuses on educational HCI for autism. We compared two domains of learning: social dialogue understanding and spatial planning, our hypothesis being that people with autism will be less skilful in the first than in the second domain. Two sets of exercises were designed for each domain: one for training purposes and the other for performance assessment before and after training. We also tested the influence of the following output modalities: text, images, speech synthesis, visual and auditory feedback. Each exercise produced log files informing on duration, number of trials and successes. So far, eight teenagers with autism have completed a 13 week training program with one session a week. First analysis of log files suggests a significant progression in dialogic understanding but not in spatial planning; nor was significant influence of output modalities found.},

The 'Power-Aware Cord' is a re-design of a common electrical power strip that displays the amount of energy passing through it at any given moment. This is done by dynamic glowing patterns produced by electroluminescent wires molded into the transparent electrical cord. Using this fully functional prototype, we have been investigating how such ambient displays can be used to increase energy awareness. An initial user study indicates that the Power-Aware Cord is a very accessible and intuitive mean for better understanding energy consumption. Future work includes further development of the mapping between load and visual pattern and in-depth studies of user perception and learning over time.},

A one-week field study examined how individuals perceive privacy needs relating to the later incidental viewing of traces of their browsing activity. Participants used a 4-tier privacy gradient to classify the privacy of their actual web browsing. The results revealed per window patterns of privacy during browsing with streaks at given privacy levels and relatively few transitions between levels. Management of incidental information is a complex problem due to multiple viewing contexts, individual differences, and the large volume of information. These privacy patterns suggest that a semi-automated approach to privacy management may be feasible.},

Analysts must be able to view incidents as they occurred without unnecessarily burdening caregivers and other children with always-on recording of data about them.

By contrast, basic graph-based visualizations of user navigation paths are easier to interpret, but it is difficult to find effective views that convey all the required information. In this paper we present the Navigation Visualizer, a web usage analysis tool that combines the two approaches. The Navigation Visualizer makes use of the rich data set that is collected by the Scone proxy-based web enhancement framework and facilitates dynamic selection of the data and interactive exploration with various layout mechanisms, color codings and markers. Several aggregated measures can be calculated and exported to statistical and data mining packages.},

The creation of a relatively small set of examples can have real cognitive benefit to the student.The LSAT Analytic Logic Tutor demonstrates that this is possible. This tutor was designed for teaching strategies for solving analytic logic games. Although such a task would be difficult to model in general, three rich problems produced enough of an impact to significantly improve student performance.

The result is an input device requiring minimal space but is potentially more efficient than a touchpad due to the tactile feedback of a tip on a finger. Our first prototype consists of a transparent tip and a small CMOS image sensor that tracks the movement of a finger on a tip. In a series of experiments, it outperformed a small analog joystick in free pointing tasks, and was comparable with a 3x4 keypad in text entry tasks.},

We observed a more localized layout of typed characters over keys in the QWERTY-like case than in the ABC case. Encouraged by the results, we carried out a series of experiments in order to compare a QWERTY-like layout and an ABC-type layout, and obtained consistently better learning curves and better final typing speeds with a QWERTY-like keypad.

We have developed a series of working prototypes, where dynamic textile patterns are incorporated into wearable items to reflect and make visible social and contextual behaviours, such as person-to-person communication, proximity and local weather conditions. Ultimately, we aim to develop a new dynamic language of wearable expression integrating aesthetics, pattern and computation into everyday artifacts with increased personal and cultural meaning.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design of eyeView, a video conferencing system that uses participant looking behavior to determine the size of online video conferencing windows. The system uses an elastic windowing algorithm that enlarges the image of the person most looked at by others, while maintaining a contextual view of other remote participants. eyeView measures interest by gauging whom participants look at using an eye tracker embedded in the display. Users can enter side conversations by looking at each other, and pressing the space bar. Cocktail-party filtering is aided by attenuating audio sources outside the social network constituted by glances between participants. By allocating both screen and audio real estate according to the joint attention of participants, eyeView supports smooth allocation of focus on the speaker, while maintaining awareness of the group.},

The mostly-volunteer team had only four months to develop a workable system. The aggressive schedule, limited budget, and distributed team-structure challenged us to find creative ways to evaluate and improve EIRS' usability. We used an approach that combined expert UI review with opportunistic exploitation of venues for gathering data on EIRS' usability. This approach, which we call convergent usability evaluation, had, in the non-profit environment, advantages over the more formal methods typically used for commercial projects. In this paper we describe the usability evaluation methods we used for the EIRS project and discuss how they converged to provide a more complete picture than we would have obtained by conventional methods.},

The folder structures to organize project information - especially electronic documents and other files - frequently resembled a "divide and conquer" problem decomposition with subfolders corresponding to major components (subprojects) of the project. Folders were clearly more than simply a means to one end: Organizing for later retrieval. Folders were information in their own right - representing, for example, a person's evolving understanding of a project and its components. Unfortunately, folders are often "overloaded" with information. For example, folders sometimes included leading characters to force an ordering ("aa", "zz"). And folder hierarchies frequently reflected a tension between organizing information for current use vs. repeated re-use.},

In addition, the observed speed differences between the conditions were small. Although reading longer category lists requires more time, the users benefited from the increased descriptiveness, causing the overall speed to be almost equal.

In this paper, we present our experiences applying traditional experimental techniques for field research in two separate projects set in urban environments.

We are particularly interested in processes of information discovery, in which ideas are iteratively reformulated in the context of working with information.To investigate how the representation of navigational surrogates affects how people work with information, we have created a collection of undergraduate psychology curriculum resources in 3 alternative formats: a linear list of textual elements, a spatialized set of textual elements, and a spatialized set of labeled images that have been composited. To evaluate navigation with these surrogate formats during information discovery, we designed divergent browsing tasks, that is, tasks that require assembling information from multiple diverse sources. A within-subjects evaluation indicates that users prefer the spatial labeled images format, and navigate more effectively with it.},

When audio lagged video, performance improved monotonically to a maximum at +167ms, where performance equaled 30fps in synch. The results suggest that frame rate and skew are not orthogonal parameters but must both be taken into consideration for AV-delivery. The findings do not support the current notion that 10 fps videos do not adequately capture visual content for speech perception.

We investigated workarounds and their effects through observation and interviews in a major teaching medical center. Our results suggest 4 key features of workarounds that technologies might help address: (a) workarounds differ as a function of people's role; (b) workarounds draw on tacit knowledge of others' abilities and willingness to help; (c) workarounds can have a cascading effect, causing other workarounds down the line; (d) workarounds often rely on principles of fairness and who owes whom a favor. We provide recommendations for designing systems to better support workarounds in dynamic environments.},

abstract = {The steering law model describes pointing device motion through constrained paths. Previous uses of the model are deficient because they are built using only error-free responses, ignoring altogether the path of the cursor. We correct this by proposing and validating a technique to include spatial variability, including errors. The technique is a variant of the well-known "effective target width" used in Fitts' law models. An experiment designed to test our technique demonstrates the improvement: Correlations are consistently higher when spatial variability is included in building the model. Suggestions to aid further development of the steering law model are included.},

However, this alone does not establish eye contact. Both parties also need to be aware of being watched by the other. We proposed an eye-contact method between humans and robots satisfying these two conditions. In our previous work, however, we mainly consider eye contact from humans to robots. In this paper, we consider the reversal case. We deal with cases where a robot wants to start communication with a particular person. In such cases, the robot needs to make the person aware of its gaze. The robot should make the person feel clearly that it is none other than him/her who the robot is looking at. We show through experiments that the body action of the robot is effective for this.},

Timelines also force frame-accuracy on the author, which interferes with rapid exploration of different designs. We present a redesign of the timeline in which users can specify the relative ordering and causality of events without specifying exact times or durations. This effectively enables users to "work rough" in time. We then implement a prototype and perform a user study to investigate its efficiency.},

Motion is complex; it can vary across numerous dimensions, each of which is potentially an information-bearing element in the visualization. Which dimensions are used and how the data is mapped onto them are the key questions in using motion effectively. In this paper we present two interfaces that use motion as the primary visual element for representing data. These interfaces, Seascape and Volcano, use periodic animation loops to represent key social interaction features in online discussions. We propose that motion may be particularly well suited for representing data about behavior and actions, creating visualizations that intuitively depict different levels and types of activity.

Our study revealed the difficulties of mapping these strokes to individual keys using the current symbols. We present a case study illustrating the user-centered redesign of these symbols. The new symbols allow for faster entry speeds and lower error rates as compared to the current commercial solution. Results with our solution were also favorable when compared to Pinyin, a popular cross-cultural solution relying on the Roman alphabet.

When the subject matter is about procedures, however, we have discovered that interfaces can take advantage of what we call Programmatic Semantics, procedural relations that can be inferred from the linguistic structure. Roughly, nouns can be interpreted as data structures; verbs are functions; adjectives are properties. Some linguistic forms imply conditionals, loops, and recursive structures.We illustrate the principles of Programmatic Semantics with a description of Metafor, a "brainstorming" editor for programs, analogous to an outlining tool for prose writing. Metafor interactively converts English sentences to partially specified program code, to be used as "scaffolding" for a more detailed program. A user study showed that Metafor is capable of capturing enough Programmatic Semantics to facilitate non-programming users and beginners' conceptualization of programming problems.},

We designed these techniques as an alternative to 3D widgets and performed a usability study to compare the effectiveness of all three techniques.

Current interfaces do little to help users see patterns of social interaction within email data.We introduce a multiscale email interface that utilizes computed intimacy measures and chronology as parameters for information visualization. Rhythms of intimacy in email experience are made visible as patterns of color and shapes in a zoomable chronological grid. Qualitative user experience data indicates that such an email visualization can provide striking insights into the experience of social connectedness over time.

abstract = {Realityflythrough is a telepresence/tele-reality system that works in the dynamic, uncalibrated environments typically associated with ubiquitous computing. By opportunistically harnessing networked mobile video cameras, it allows a user to remotely and immersively explore a physical space. Live 2d video feeds are situated in a 3d representation of the world. Rather than try to achieve photorealism at every point in space, we instead focus on providing the user with a sense of how the video streams relate to one another spatially. By providing cues in the form of dynamic transitions, we can approximate photorealistic telepresence while harnessing cameras "in the wild." This paper shows that transitions between situated 2d images are sensible and provide a compelling telepresence experience.},

abstract = {This study investigated the interactions of 72 children (ages 7 to 15) with Sony's robotic dog AIBO in comparison to a live Australian Shepherd dog. Results showed that more children conceptualized the live dog, as compared to AIBO, as having physical essences, mental states, sociality, and moral standing. Based on behavioral analyses, children also spent more time touching and within arms distance of the live dog, as compared to AIBO. That said, a surprising majority of children conceptualized and interacted with AIBO in ways that were like a live dog. Discussion focuses on two questions. First, is it possible that a new technological genre is emerging in HCI that challenges traditional ontological categories (e.g., between animate and inanimate)? Second, are pervasive interactions with a wide array of "robotic others" -- increasingly sophisticated personified computational artifacts that mimic biological forms and pull psychologically in mental, social, and moral ways -- a good thing for human beings.},

abstract = {We develop an interactive Braille-recognition system using a portable camera for visually impaired persons who cannot read Braille. Our system helps them to find and then push a desired button, as is necessary when using an elevator or a ticket vending machine, for example. It is natural to think that the information provided, in Braille, with specific buttons is sufficient for successful operation in using an elevator or a ticket vending machine. Most visually impaired persons, however, cannot read Braille. To push a desired button, the user needs to hear only the word or letter associated with the specific Braille character so that s/he can correctly relate the buttons to Braille characters. If the user is informed of all the Braille characters in front of her/him, s/he will be unable to relate the buttons to Braille characters. In our system, the user interactively specifies the location of a particular Braille character to be read by using hand gestures. The system recognizes the user's gestures and reads the desired Braille aloud. In our preliminary experiment, six blindfolded subjects were all able to interact with our system, and recognized the meaning of the buttons that s/he identified.},

Due to their multi-functionality, however, the devices have begun to be used by multiple people in co-located situations. This paper discusses near future technologies: a mobile device with a projector and intuitive manipulation techniques by using a video camera mounted on the device. It is difficult to realize a mobile device with a small and light projector that still retains the feature of mobility, so we have developed a system to project displays of mobile devices by tracking their three-dimensional positions and orientations. The proposed system called Hotaru (a firefly, in English) allows users to annotate, rotate or transfer files between multiple devices by touching their projected displays with fingers.},

Statistical comparisons of adjacent targets/digits indicated that subjects differentiated roughly seven input levels within the set of ten force ranges actually used. Time taken to input the target force increased significantly with the size of the target force, suggesting that smaller force ranges should be considered in future implementations of force input.

Using fixed-position PDAs as simulated seismographs, students determine the magnitude and distance of a series of "randomly" timed events by reading characteristic waveforms and using calibrated tape measures to sweep out arcs from multiple stations until they literally collide, physically enacting mathematical trilateration.

abstract = {Video-mediated communication systems such as teleconferencing and videophone have become popular. As with face-to-face communication, non-verbal cues such as gaze, facial expression, head orientation and gestures in visual systems play an important role. Existing systems, however, do not support mutual gaze because the lay-out of the camera and monitor is restricted. Thus, conversations using visual systems differ from those in face-to-face communication. This paper clarifies the problems of the video-mediated system, specifically for comparing the system with communication using eye-contact and with communication using no-eye-contact. This study focuses on the protocol of opening communication, e.g. establishment of a visual-audio link, person identification and confirmation of the acceptance of conversation. We conducted experiments using the two systems. Analysis of recorded video sequences revealed that the system using communication with eye-contact induced behavior similar to the system using face-to-face communication.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multimodal information presentation method for a basic dance training system. The system targets on beginners and enables them to learn basics of dances easily. One of the most effective ways of learning dances is to watch a video showing the performance of dance masters. However, some information cannot be conveyed well through video. One is the translational motion, especially that in the depth direction. We cannot tell exactly how far does the dancers move forward or backward. Another is the timing information. Although we can tell how to move our arms or legs from video, it is difficult to know when to start moving them. We solve the first issue by introducing an image display on a mobile robot. We can learn the amount of translation just by following the robot. We introduce active devices for the second issue. The active devices are composed of some vibro-motors and are developed to direct action-starting cues with vibration. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our multimodal information presentation method.},

For prototyping, a designer creates hardware and software sketches with pen based computers using STCtools. Sketches of hardware and software are drawn in a client device and composed in an electronic whiteboard, which is the server device. PUI widgets can be physically attached on a foam mockup or on a screen of the client device. The hardware-software integrated simulations are conducted on ARdesk.

We developed a multi-agent computer model in NetLogo to complement laboratory-based organizational simulations [3]. In the lab, favoritism among collocated team members (collocators) appeared to increase their performance. However, in the computer simulation, when controlled for communication delay, in-group favoritism had a detrimental effect on the performance of collocators. This suggested that the advantage of collocators shown in the lab was due to synchronous communication, not favoritism. The canceling-out effects of in-group bias and communication delay explained why many studies did not see performance difference between collocated and remote team members. The multi-agent modeling in this case proved its value by both clarifying previous laboratory findings and guiding design of future experiments.},

This study identifies that the type of authentication system used can affect users' subsequent perceived control, situational awareness and trust. The results from a questionnaire and in-depth interviews with 86 participants were triangulated to compare two different authentication processes, namely, a 'security box' (i.e. random system generated passwords at the users' location) and 'fixed passwords' (i.e. user owned and constant). The security box and login procedures were perceived significantly more trustworthy and secure at any location than 'fixed passwords'. Four main concepts were identified: "trust" "the authentication system", "location" and "control". The implications of these findings for HCI are discussed.},

abstract = {Many design models and representations have been proposed to support user-centered system design, such as scenarios, use cases, and prototypes. With these artifacts, designers typically deal with representations of fragments of the application, and sometimes have difficulties communicating with one another about design decisions. To face some of the communication challenges during design, we believe that we could use a global view of the system's apparent behavior, from the users' point of view. Such a representation would serve as a common reference for HCI designers from different disciplinary backgrounds, helping to foster communication among them. In our goal to promote a shared understanding of the application, we have investigated different professionals' usage of MoLIC, an interaction modeling language that follows an interaction-as-conversation metaphor. MoLIC allows designers to build a blueprint of all the interactions that may take place when the application is used.},

Often traditional HCI principles and guidelines need to be disregarded or broken in order to allow for the intended learning to take place [1, 6]. How to adapt existing HCI methods and techniques to this domain is still an open issue for the HCI and Education fields [5]. In this paper we propose the Scaffold Representation Model (SRM), which allows intended educational support for learners in the application to be abstractly described. The model allows for the generation of educational information that can be added to a traditional HCI task model. We describe an experiment in which SRM was used in the design of a learning support system and its contribution to the process of design.},

abstract = {We present a novel methodology for monitoring the affective states of computer users. The method is based on thermal imaging of the face. To the user, the imaging system appears much like a video-conferencing camera. The method does not require contact with the subject and is passive; therefore, monitoring can be continuous and transparent to the computer user. We have found that user stress is correlated with increased blood flow in the frontal vessel of the forehead. This increased blood flow dissipates convective heat, which can be monitored through thermal imaging. The system has been evaluated on 12 subjects, and compared against real-time measurements of Energy Expenditure (EE). The new method is highly correlated with the established, but awkward EE methodology. The StressCam methodology is applicable to many instances where the real time measurement of users' emotional state is needed.},

In this paper, we explore introducing structure into the activity through the use of an artificial, unrelated, peripheral stream of information. We investigate the feasibility of this idea by integrating a stream of images into an existing meeting capture system. Our study suggests that this technique may be used effectively in some situations, and reveals similar methods of capturing and using indices that could be explored.},

In this paper, we investigate (1) users' ability to identify expertise in advice and (2) effects of media bias in different representations. In a laboratory study, we presented 160 participants with two advisors -- one represented by text-only; the other represented by one of four alternate formats: video, audio, avatar, or photo+text. Unknown to the participants, one was an expert (i.e. trained) and the other was a non-expert (i.e. untrained). We observed participants' advice seeking behavior under financial risk as an indicator of their trust in the advisor. For all rich media representations, participants were able to identify the expert, but we also found a tendency for seeking video and audio advice, irrespective of expertise. Avatar advice, in contrast, was rarely sought, but -- like the other rich media representations -- was seen as more enjoyable and friendly than text-only advice. In a future step we plan to analyze our data for effects on advice uptake.},

Mean time on task over 20 trials was fit using a power function and perceived workload was collected using NASA Task Load Index. The results obtained indicate that content customization allows users to reach peak performance faster and reduce task learning. Also, content customization reduces perceived mental demand and frustration as content density increases. Finally, participants performed faster and with higher satisfaction under the customization conditions.},

Our key finding supports the notion of the domestic economy and the trading of programming expertise. We use the Attention Investment paradigm, and discuss how the model fits with multi-user programming situations. We discuss the importance of the parent v/s child roles in VCR use, as well as, the tension between direct manipulation (e.g. pressing record) and programming ahead of time.

Because the interface suggests many possible new connections, researchers must be able to understand how connections are established and to evaluate those connections based on their own expertise. Based on the results of our user study, we have further tailored the interface to support the work processes of biomedical researchers.

In addition to the standard actions offered by most portable digital music players, the DJammer provides its users with control capabilities previously offered only through the use of turntables. Using the DJammer, DJs can "air-scratch" digital music via simple hand motions similar to those used when scratching vinyl records, fade the music, and jump to a predefined position within the song using a wireless sensor designed to fit in the DJ's hand. The preliminary study of the device by experienced DJs suggests that it can play a role as an accessory to their professional equipment, freeing them to step away from their consoles during the performance and uncovering opportunities for creativity and personalization.},

Participants were placed into one of two search conditions and were asked to complete information-finding tasks. The usability evaluation demonstrated that the majority of users with DCD were able to access the Web but they were unable to successfully use the W3C accessibility-compliant Web sites/. The use of navigation aids was examined, different Web navigation problems were identified as well as user satisfaction and perceived usability. It is clear from this study that current Web accessibility guidelines do not sufficiently address the needs of people with cognitive disabilities. Additional research is needed to understand how cognitive disabilities affect using Web-based media.},

abstract = {One of the problems with mediated communication systems is that they limit the user's ability to listen to informal conversations of others within a remote space. In what is known as the Cocktail Party phenomenon, participants in noisy face-to-face conversations are able to focus their attention on a single individual, typically the person they look at. Media spaces do not support the cues necessary to establish this attentive mechanism. We addressed this issue in our design of OverHear, a media space that augments the user's attention in remote social gatherings through computer mediated hearing. OverHear uses an eye tracker embedded in the webcam display to direct the focal point of a robotic shotgun microphone mounted in the remote space. This directional microphone is automatically pointed towards the currently observed individual, allowing the user to OverHear this person's conversations.},

Viewing the jazz standard All Blues through the lens of ImproViz illustrates the contrasting melodic and harmonic styles of three musicians. This analysis uncovers some surprises, such as how Miles Davis played musical ideas that contradicted his own composition. ImproViz offers jazz students a new way to study jazz theory and can also serve as a real-time improvisational aid, allowing a student to borrow the harmonic vocabulary of jazz masters.},

Building on this, it is argued that the negotiation of family relations is afforded by the presented properties of the fridge and of magnets. To conclude, we introduce some general points to consider in designing interactive surfaces for the home.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automatic video editing system based on head tracking for multiparty conversations. Systems that record meetings and those that support teleconferences are attracting considerable interest. Conventional systems use a fixed-viewpoint camera and simple camera selection based on participants' utterances. However, conventional systems fail to adequately convey who is talking to whom to the viewer. We focus on the participants' head orientation since this information is useful in detecting the speaker and who the speaker is talking to. In order to automatically estimate each participant's head orientation, our system combines several modules for stereo-based head tracking. The system selects the shot of the participant that most participants are looking at, based on majority decision. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our system in several 3-participant conversations. The results show that our system can more successfully convey who is talking to whom which is an extremely crucial piece of information that allows the viewer to better under-stand conversation content.},

Most research on visual search and highlighting has used stimuli with no semantic content, while studies on information search have assumed equal visual salience of items in the search space. In real information environments like the Web, however, these things do not occur in isolation. Thus, we used a laboratory study to examine how these factors interact. The almost perfectly additive results imply that good information scent cannot overcome poor visual cues, or vice versa, and that both factors are equally important.},

This paper describes an implementation of a multi-user version of this project, in which several virtual rafts may be used simultaneously to carry characters among the islands. The multi-user experience improves on the single-user original in four ways: increased throughput, increased collaboration among the participants, increased enjoyment for the participants, and the introduction of a new mode of interaction (characters jumping directly from one raft to another). This paper also provides a preliminary evaluation of the entire system through observations from a deployment of the Virtual Raft Project to approximately two hundred people.},

By reducing many of the barriers to cameraphone use and image sharing (including increasing image quality, easing the sharing process, and removing cost barriers), we find that users quickly develop new uses for imaging. Their innovative communicative uses of imaging are understandable in terms of the social uses identified from prior photographic activity; new functional uses are developing as well.},

Focus selection with remote controls tends to be cumbersome as selection buttons place the remote in a device-specific modality. We addressed this issue with the design of Media EyePliances, home theatre appliances augmented with a digital eye contact sensor. An appliance is selected as the focus of remote commands by looking at its sensor. A central server subsequently routes all commands provided by remote, keyboard or voice input to the focus EyePliance. We discuss a calibration-free digital eye contact sensing technique that allows Media EyePliances to determine the user's point of gaze.},

This paper describes an unsupervised technique in which contextual information gathered by ubiquitous sensors is used to help users label a multitude of anonymous activity episodes. This context-aware recognition survey is a game-like computer program in which users attempt to correctly guess which activity is happening after seeing a series of symbolic images that represent sensor values generated during the activity. We report a user study of the system, focusing on how well subjects were able to recognize their own activities, the activities of others, and counterfeits that did not correspond to any activity.},

We present a unified approach to both maximizing and evaluating the guessability of symbolic input. This approach can be used by anyone wishing to design a symbol set with high guessability, or to evaluate the guessability of an existing symbol set. We also present formulae for quantifying guessability and agreement among guesses. An example is offered in which the guessability of the EdgeWrite unistroke alphabet was improved by users from 51.0% to 80.1% without designer intervention. The original and improved alphabets were then tested for their immediate usability with the procedure used by MacKenzie and Zhang (1997). Users entered the original alphabet with 78.8% and 90.2% accuracy after 1 and 5 minutes of learning, respectively. The improved alphabet bettered this to 81.6% and 94.2%. These improved results were competitive with prior results for Graffiti, which were 81.8% and 95.8% for the same measures.},

However, we argue that with the advancement of computer graphics technology and graphical implementations of linguistic results obtained from the study of sign languages, "writing" in a sign language should not be difficult. We have pursued exploratory work in constructing virtual gestures, applying hand constraints to facilitate the creation of natural gestures, and combining these gestures into meaningful American Sign Language (ASL) parts that follow the ASL Movement-Hold model. The results, although preliminary, are encouraging. We believe that space effective sign language composition is possible space with the implementation of easy-to-use graphical user interfaces and the development of specialized data management methods.},

abstract = {Designers of information visualization systems have the choice to present information in a single integrated view or in multiple views. In practice, there is a continuum between the two strategies and designers must decide how much of each strategy to apply. Although high-level design guidelines (heuristics) are available, there are few low-level perceptual design guidelines for making this decision. We performed a controlled experiment with one, two, and four views to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies on target detection and trend finding tasks in the context of multidimensional glyphs overlaid onto geographic maps. Results from the target detection tasks suggest that visual encoding is a more important factor when detecting a single attribute than the number of views. Additionally, for detecting two attributes, the trend indicates that reusing the most perceptually salient visual feature in multiple views provides faster performance than an integrated view that must map one of the attributes to a less salient feature.},

This allows the user to be informed when they are in the vicinity of an image or hyperlink; previously they would only have been informed when they are physically on the link. Thus, when the user is close to an image or hyperlink, haptics and audio will be used to inform and guide them to the actual spatial position. The Web browser plug-in and the associated audio and haptic feedback tools are described in the paper. Finally, results from a pilot study on the usability of this system are also presented.},

Previous experiments have shown that these teams are vulnerable to in-groups forming between the collocated and distributed members. In this study we switched the locations of some of the members about halfway through the experiment to see what effect it would have on these ingroups. People who changed from being isolated 'telecommuters' to collocators very quickly formed new collaborative relationships. People who were moved out of a collocated room had more trouble adjusting, and tried unsuccessfully to maintain previous ties. Overall, collocation was a more powerful determiner of collaboration patterns than previous relationships. Implications and future research are discussed.},

In an experimental comparison of space-filling, linear timeline, and time quilt layouts, participants carried out the task of finding photos in their personal photo collections averaging 4,000 items. They performed 45% faster on time quilt.Furthermore, while current zoomable photo browsers are designed for visual searches,this support does not scale to thousands of photos: individual thumbnails become less informative as they grow smaller. We found a subjective preference for the use of representative photos to provide an overview for visual searches in place of the diminishing thumbnails.},

Breakaway uses the information from sensors placed on an office chair to communicate in a non-obtrusive manner how long the user has been sitting. Breakaway is a small sculpture placed on the desk. Its design is inspired by animation arts and theater, which rely heavily on body language to express emotions. Its shape and movement reflect the form of the human body; an upright position reflecting the body's refreshed pose, and a slouching position reflecting the body's pose after sitting for a long time. An initial evaluation shows a correlation between the movement of the sculpture and when participants took breaks, suggesting that ambient displays that make use of aesthetic and lifelike form might be promising for making positive changes in human behavior.},

abstract = {Conducting research using the web is often an iterative process of collecting, comparing and contrasting information. Not surprisingly, web-based research tasks habitually span multiple web sessions and involve considerable web page revisitation. Such tasks are not only carried out by researchers, but also by casual web users who, for example, plan vacations and large purchases. Despite the prominence of this activity among web users, existing tools support it poorly. We propose an alternative approach, whereby web-based research tasks are facilitated by a web workspace which represents collected URLs with web page thumbnails. A prototype of our design was developed and studied in an evaluation with 12 participants. Each of the participants adopted the workspace approach instinctively: the workspace was used for web page revisitation, web page comparison, collection overview, cross-session task continuation, and continuous task focus.},

We have developed a mobile image-based search system that takes images of objects as queries and finds relevant web pages by matching them to similar images on the web. Image-based search works well when matching full scenes, such as images of buildings or landmarks, and for matching objects when the boundary of the object in the image is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple interactive paradigm for obtaining a segmented object boundary, and show how a shape-based image matching algorithm can use the object outline to find similar images on the web.},

abstract = {As mobile devices become location-aware, they offer the promise of powerful new applications. While computers work with physical locations like latitude and longitude, people think and speak in terms of places, like "my office" or ``Sue's house''. Therefore, location-aware applications must incorporate the notion of places to achieve their full potential. This requires systems to acquire the places that are meaningful for each user. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, we know of no empirical, quantitative evaluations of these algorithms, so the question of how well they work currently is unanswered. We report here on an experiment that begins to provide an answer; we show that a place discovery algorithm can do a good job of discovering places that are meaningful to users. The results have important implications for system design and open up interesting avenues for future research.},

The educational power of digital technology for children has typically been limited by the fact that users explore and manipulate abstract two-dimensional screen-based representations, and not real physical objects. Embedding interactivity into physical objects, therefore, allows the "best of both worlds" - supporting traditional exploratory play with physical objects that can be extended and enhanced by the interactive power of digital technology. Participants in this SIG are invited to share ideas regarding the design and development of tangible interfaces, and to bring demos or slides/videos showing work in this area. Participants will review as many examples as time allows, and discuss the issues surrounding design and development of such interfaces.

Issues involving seniors are likely to rise to the forefront of national consciousness. A primary concern for this population is the loss of companionship, which can contribute to isolation, depression, and decreased socialization [9]. A concept for a data management service - mPath - is proposed to combat isolation among seniors. mPath works with administrators of assisted-living facilities to oversee an ad-hoc volunteer network. Interacting with residents, these volunteers assess social relationships and emotional reactions, quantifying for the computer their qualitative observations. The system examines accumulated data over time to reveal anomalies, highlight trends and anticipate future responses. Administrators may choose to act upon that information. The overall effect is to increase the social well being of seniors in an unobtrusive manner.},

Loss of a companion can be a primary cause of depression, and decline of social well-being and health for the elderly, so the challenge is to design for "artificial" companionship to support the elderly. We met this challenge by employing extensive research in geriatric psychology, empirical and analytical human-computer interaction methods, interaction design techniques, and technologies currently available or in development. Our solution is a wearable and stationary device that will allow the user to 1) record events through pictures and audio for sharing, 2) gather artifacts of their past such as photographs into a multimedia slideshow format for sharing with others, and 3) allow friends and family to be aware of the user's location for safety purposes.},

Without regular contact from friends and family to amend this loneliness, a gap may exist in the individual's social welfare.Through a unique combination of Industrial Design and Interaction Design methods, we have formed a process that allows us to explore the contextual background of a problem as well as a physical product solution. By using this process, we were able to create Pollen, an affordable product that provides companionship through the exchange of meaningful artifacts. This paper describes both the process taken to create this unique product as well as the product itself.},

abstract = {The ECHOES project (Encouraging Companionship, Home Organization, and Entertainment in Seniors), is focused on understanding and improving aspects of companionship in senior populations aged sixty-five years and older. Individuals in this age range commonly experience the loss of close friends and life partners. Furthermore, they are at risk of suffering from feelings of loneliness and depression. The project team consulted with several experts on aging in order to better understand the target population. The team followed an iterative design process which included focus groups and field studies. Potential design possibilities were identified and a final design prototype was chosen after several rounds of usability testing. The proposed system includes "TeleTable," an interactive table-based device that offers intuitive means of arranging and organizing digital media. The TeleTable also functions in a communicative capacity, encouraging individuals to interact with each other by playing simple games, conversing verbally, and exchanging digital photos with each other. This system also includes the "Pitara," a portable device enabling the association of physical mementos and keepsakes to digital media which adds a mobility, lifetime sharing and storytelling aspect to the TeleTable.},

The purpose of PAL is to provide artificial companionship to support the social well-being of elderly homebound persons living alone above the age of 65 years. PAL also provides a fully reliable source of emergency contact. PAL is intended for the elderly homebound persons of today with its simplistic design. In order to create PAL methodologies and techniques for designing user centred products or devices were considered. Suggestions from the elderly persons and district nurses were also taken into consideration when designing PAL. Through the application of the above methodology we created an interactive entertainment system that is emotionally engaging, entertaining, cost effective, and supports at least one non-entertainment function for the owner.},

Our approach emphasizes amusement and benefit - amusement in form of entertainment and benefit in terms of medical care. The key to awake elderly people's emotional engagement in an artificial companion is its emotional behavior. Therefore, we propose a companion that does not look technical, which is mostly associated with the words cold and impersonal. Furthermore it features facial expression and gesture. An important design aspect was that it is no additional burden for elderly people. Engaging with it is free and fun.},

This fact is related with the ever increasing migration of one or more of their relatives, mostly to the USA. Our work aims to provide a technological solution that eases the isolation of elder people living alone in Mexico while their families are abroad. To envision and inform our design we interviewed independent old persons living alone. We propose an electronic family newspaper, through which elders and their families share information, personal reminiscences and cultural stories, and occasionally interact with each other. Through its functionality, the electronic newspaper enables elders not only to maintain close social ties, but ameliorate cognitive decline.},

Important findings of the data include the need for activity to continue as a matter of over all health and as a management tool for recovery from a loss. The importance of continued learning and physical activity is also indicated as a means of maintaining wellbeing.

Here we take the perspective of the inhabited environment, that is, environments positioned somewhere on this continuum that are inhabited by virtual (embodied) agents, that interact with each other and with their human partners. Hence, we look at it from the multi-party interaction perspective. In this workshop we will investigate the current state of the art, its shortcomings and a future research agenda.},
