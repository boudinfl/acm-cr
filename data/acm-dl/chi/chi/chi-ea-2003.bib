abstract = {Navigating virtual environments usually requires a wired interface, game console, or keyboard. The advent of perceptual interface techniques allows a new option, the passive and untethered sensing of users' pose and gesture to allow them maneuver through virtual worlds. We show new algorithms for passive, real-time articulated tracking with standard cameras and personal computers. Several different interaction styles are compared, based on an analysis of the space of possible perceptual interface abstractions for full-body navigation and the results of a wizard-of-oz study of user preferences. In this demo we show our prototype system with users guiding avatars through a series of 3-D virtual game worlds.},

However, editing video remains difficult for several reasons: it is a time-based medium, it has dual tracks of audio and video, and current tools force users to work at the smallest level of detail. Based on interviews with professional video editors, we developed a video editor, called Silver, that uses metadata to make digital video editing more accessible to novices. To help users visualize video, Silver provides multiple views with different semantic content and at different levels of abstraction, including storyboard, editable transcript, and timeline views. Silver offers smart editing operations that help users resolve the inconsistencies that arise because of the different boundaries in audio and video.},

We feel that developers often look at the user's problems through developers eyes rather than through the user's eyes. Having researched and actively used ethnographic field methods over the past few years, we argue that it is necessary to create an awareness of this perspective issue, its consequences for how we interpret field sessions and its influence on product development. We present a collection of existing methods that can be applied to challenge our perspective as developers and to shift our view to that of the users. To illustrate how these methods may lead to a deeper understanding we start with a portrait of one of our informants. We present two provotypes to show how we try to incorporate the users' perspective in our design solutions. Finally, we reflect on the interaction language which products speak and argue that usability studies without awareness of the perspective issue make products more clear for the developers only.},

abstract = {Manuals of technical devices are often not very helpful to the user. This study investigates the influence of spatial instructions versus conventional linear step-by-step manuals on inexperienced users' performance handling cellular phones. Results show a significant interaction between user age and manual. Middle aged users profit more from the spatial information given in the manual that contains the phone's menu tree than from the step-by-step instruction, whereas subjects older than 50 show no improvement. It is concluded that manufacturers should consider the inclusion of spatial information on the cellular phones' menu structure in their manuals, as the majority of users would benefit.},

My research explores two areas to support mobile information re-finding. First, I am investigating how users re-find information first found on the web: how people approach re-finding, what information they recall when trying to re-find, and how they converse about re-finding. Second, I am examining how shared context can be established and utilized between a user and a computer system to improve future re-finding interactions. In this paper, I present two efforts to explore these areas. I briefly describe a prototype system to support mobile information re-finding through a telephone-based voice interface, and then present preliminary results from a study of how people converse when engaging in collaborative information refinding tasks with another person. The results of this study suggest that context plays an important role in re-finding.},

Human trust decisions, however, are also based on affective reactions, which can be triggered by interpersonal cues. This research investigates the effect of visual interpersonal cues on users' trust in e-commerce. First results indicate that visual interpersonal cues in the form of photographs have an effect on users' decision-making. This effect, however, strongly depends on context variables, as well as individual differences. A further issue under investigation is the potential negative effect of interpersonal cues on task performance. Thus, in a next stage, this research will combine eye-tracking with physiological measurements to investigate effects on task performance and user cost.},

One group had only implicit feedback that the setting had been changed so that success had to be inferred from the lack of an error message. The other groups had explicit feedback for a set period of 1, 2 or 5 seconds. The implicit feedback group were significantly less likely to complete the task than the explicit feedback groups. There is also evidence that the one second timed explicit feedback condition was less effective in inducing participants to eliminate their current subgoal than the two and five second explicit feedback conditions.

To achieve this, ComAdapter offsets the differences in the configurations of the rooms. In a simple preliminary system, body motions are successfully adapted and transmitted between two rooms with different layout. The success of the experiment confirms the validity and potential of ComAdapter.},

With these new information sources finding their way into cars comes increasing concern about the potential adverse effects resulting from drivers' interactions with such multi-function devices. This paper examines the disruptive impact of complex, interactive, hands-free cell phone communications upon the visual awareness of drivers proceeding through high volume intersections. The present study documents changes in driver visual behavior, resulting from cognitive distraction of speech-based interactions, that may contribute to intersection crashes. The results of this research raise significant HCI implications for the design of interactive Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) within the automotive sector.},

A document is first affectively analyzed using a unique textual affect sensing engine, which leverages commonsense knowledge to classify text more reliably and comprehensively than can be achieved with keyword spotting methods alone. Using this engine, sentences are annotated using six basic Ekman emotions. Colors used to represent each of these emotions are sequenced into a color bar, which represents the progression of affect through a text document. Smoothing techniques allow the user to vary the granularity of the affective structure being displayed on the color bar. The bar is hyperlinked in a way such that it can be used to easily navigate the document. A user evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method for visualizing and navigating a document's affective structure facilitates a user's within-document information foraging activity.},

We show that, even with constant visual angles and legibility, visitors are still more likely to glance over a user's shoulder to read information on a large wall-projected display than on a smaller traditional desktop monitor. We assert that, in addition to legibility, there are more subtle social factors that may contribute to the loss of privacy on physically large displays. Implementing hardware and software ideas for mitigating this loss of privacy remains future research.},

We re-analyse their data in view of ISO9241-9, the new standard for evaluating pointing devices. The reanalysis yields a throughput of 2.65 bps, or 4.32 bps including a nominal adjustment for the time for the hand to adjust its grip on the mouse.

abstract = {In the physical world, every user exists at one and only one place, but in a collaborative virtual environment (CVE), other paradigms are achievable such as a user existing at more than one place at a time. In a collaborative environment, a user is typically engaged with one primary activity at a time. As the number of collaborative activities increases, users are unable to maintain focal attention on all activities, and must offload some cognitive effort to a peripheral attention sphere. This delegation of attention-the movement of primary activities as focal attention to secondary activities as non-focal attention-requires that users remember certain parameters of context switching, such as what the secondary activities are, and more importantly, when to switch their focal attention to these activities. Keeping track of these context-switching parameters is itself a cognitive load that often degenerates focal attention on primary activities.Our goal is to augment users' cognition by delegating the work of remembering context-switching parameters to other entities in a collaborative environment. We call these entities avatar proxies because our implementation is in a CVE in which users are iconified as avatars, but the techniques and results are general to a broader range of collaborative environments. Avatar proxies notify users when they are required to switch their focal attention to secondary activities.},

abstract = {We propose unvoiced speech recognition, "Mime Speech Recognition". It recognizes speech by observing the muscles associated with speech. It is not based on voice signals but electromyography (EMG). It will realize unvoiced communication, which is a new communication style. Because voice signals are not used, it can be applied in noisy environments; it also supports people without vocal-cords and aphasics. In preliminary experiments, we try to recognize the 5 Japanese vowels. EMG signals from the 3 muscles that contribute greatly to the utterance of Japanese vowels are input to a neural network. The recognition accuracy is over 90% for the three subjects tested.},

Many of them focus on the development of 3D audio interfaces to map the entire surrounding space. Other studies center on the impact of sound interaction on cognition by evaluating the usability of these applications. No previous work has centered on using spatialized sound to develop collaborative skills in blind learners. This ongoing research study introduces AudioBattleShip, an interactive audio-based environment to enhance collaboration and cognition in blind learners. AudioBattleship mimics the traditional game battleship for sighted people but without visual cues. A preliminary pilot study has been implemented showing that blind children collaboration can be enhanced through the interaction with spatialized sound.},

In this paper we will show how the System Blocks enable young children (as early as four years old) to create and interact with systems that simulate real-life dynamic behavior such as a bank account; population growth; or the delicate equilibrium of an ecosystem. The System Blocks gives young children a hands-on environment to learn about complex behavior and encourage new ways of thinking.},

It employs a single camera with a compound half-mirror; this configuration also allows the top and side views of the stack to be captured simultaneously. Our approach is to make it easier for the user to handle stacks of items; it will enhance the tabletop metaphor for intuitive interaction in real-world environments where stacks are very common.},

Typically, the identity of the goal item is not known beforehand by the system. The technique therefore infers users' intentions from the type of movements carried out and increases the amount of resistance provided as the speed of the user's movements decreases. Although the technique might initially sound counter-intuitive, the results of the experiment, reported in this paper, confirm the effectiveness of this approach. We believe that this new technique is likely to have beneficial and wide-ranging applicability across a wide range of devices in everyday life.},

Our experiments showed that subjects' discrimination of friction was significantly better than that of stiffness or the spatial period of sinusoidal textures, over the range of stimuli investigated. Thus, it is proposed that graphical data could be made more easily accessible to blind users by scaling the data values to friction rather than shape or size, as in traditional bar charts.},

Many of the users interviewed report that notes need to be temporary, viewable, mobile, postable, transferable, short, easy to create and destroy. Paper-based tools are clearly preferred over electronic for managing notable information, and are used much more often. PDAs are almost never used for notable information because they lack high-resolution screens, are bulky, and require too much time to enter new information. E-mail is the most used electronic tool and is commonly given dedicated screen space so that it was always visible. Design recommendations for electronic office technology are presented.},

This issue has created the opportunity to explore the possibility of incorporating "containers" as an additional navigational capability that will allow the resulting serial interface to be organized hierarchically. This ultimately will increase the user's navigational "sense of place" as well as minimizing the user's cognitive burden.},

The software permits researchers to use common PDA mobile computing devices for experience sampling studies. The basic tool offers options not currently available in any other open-source sampling package. However, the tool also has new functionality: context-aware experience sampling. This feature permits researchers to acquire feedback from users in particular situations that are detected by sensors connected to a mobile computing device.},

By using ultra-sonic positioning and optimized graphics, we achieve a high frame-rate (30 fps), allowing for very smooth panning and interaction. We argue that this way of viewing captured whiteboard annotations is more natural and intuitive than current desktop-based systems.},

We currently focus on spatiotemporal control of odor, rather than capturing and synthesizing odor itself. If we simply diffused the odor into the atmosphere, it would be difficult to clean it away in a short time. Several olfactory displays that inject the scented air under the nose through tubes have been proposed to realize spatiotemporal control of olfaction, but they require the user to wear something on one's face. Here, we propose an unencumbering olfactory display, by conveying a clump of scented air from a certain remote place to the user's nose. To implement this concept, we used an "air cannon" that generates toroidal vortices of the scented air. We conducted a preliminary experiment to examine the possibility of this method's ability to display scent to a restricted space. The result shows that we could successfully display incense to the target user.},

From the themes and concepts that emerged from the data a conceptual model of ATM use was constructed.

Then we demonstrate the current prototype system called "Godzilla" that supports the creative design especially for the car exterior designer. The designers can draw the concept image on a 2D pad (tablet with an LCD). When they grasp it and put it in midair, the shape of the 2D sketch is automatically recognized and appears as 3D sketch on a 3D pad (stereovision TV). They can sketch, modify, and observe from different viewpoints in both 2D and 3D. Note that 3D images are not displayed as a beautiful CG image, but a 3D sketch that consists of many 3D-cursive lines produced by mimicking the designer's pen touch in order to keep the designers in the reflective cognitive mode and to provide them with rich stimuli for their creative activities.},

Dynamic viewpoint tethering is proposed as a means to increase user control and reduce the need for mental rotations, thus facilitating the acquisition of configurational knowledge about the virtual space.The concept of dynamic viewpoint tethering is explained and recent research findings are presented. Twelve volunteers participated in an experiment in which they were instructed to control an aircraft-shaped cursor flying through a set of virtual tunnels and to answer questions about the environment. Experimental results showed that neither the loose dynamic tether nor the rigid tether supported the best control performance. Rather, optimal tether configuration lies at the centre of the rigidity continuum. The research results provide useful guidelines for the design of navigational system interfaces.},

Having computational models of humor allows interface designers to have the computer generate and interpret humor when interacting with users.In different studies it has been shown that humans respond in the same way to computers as they do to persons with respect to psychosocial phenomena such as personality, politeness, flattery, and in-group favoritism. Making use of this paradigm we may investigate a similar role to be played in human-computer interaction for various types of humor use and we can see whether the regulating and social-psychological aspects of humor can play positive roles in human-computer interaction.},

abstract = {In this workshop we will try to obtain a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the expert review and heuristic inspection methods. We will do this by comparing results of independent expert reviews, heuristic inspections and usability tests of the same state-of-the-art website carried out by participating expert usability professionals.},

abstract = {As digital technologies proliferate in the home, the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) community has turned its attention from the workplace and productivity tools towards domestic design environments and non-utilitarian activities. In the workplace, applications tend to focus on productivity and efficiency and involve relatively well-understood requirements and methodologies, but in domestic design environments we are faced with the need to support new classes of activities. While usability is still central to the field, HCI is beginning to address considerations such as pleasure, fun, emotional effect, aesthetics, the experience of use, and the social and cultural impacts of new technologies. These considerations are particularly relevant to the home, where technologies are situated or embedded within an ecology that is rich with meaning and nuance.The aim of this workshop is to explore ways of designing domestic technology by incorporating an awareness of cultural context, accrued social meanings, and user experience.},

abstract = {People, both consciously and unconsciously, use subtle expressions to indirectly communicate their emotions and intentions through variations of the gaze direction, voice tone and gesture speed. People also perceive changes in the internal states of others from subtle changes in their expressivities while interacting with them. Subtle expressivity plays the supporting part to the leading role of explicit expressivity, such as contents of speech or category of facial expressions. However, subtle expressivity plays an important role to give moderate effects or gently regulate the relationship among the participants through a continuous interaction.These subtle expressivities are little focused on the design of interactive media in the context of software products and computers. Only in the area of computer games in which pre-designed animated characters are used, the full potential of subtle expressivity is fully understood and used.Although the general interest of the human-computer interaction research community in life-likeness and personality as a goal of software design is growing for reducing cognitive load [1,2], we are far from having coherent understanding of what subtle expressivity actually is and how products and processes can address it. We might question whether designing for subtle expressivity will result in gentle emotional effects on people and whether the processes and topics involved differ in any significant way from designing for believability or personality.},

abstract = {The people who run large-scale computer systems deserve the attention of the HCI community. These professionals work with increasingly diverse and complex hardware and software, large systems often characterized as "unknowable" by a single person. Relying on relatively crude tools, these professionals keep the technological world running. By improving the system administration work environment, the cost of computing and risk of downtime will be decreased while the deployment of complex, beneficial systems will increase.This one-day workshop will focus on the HCI problems of system administrators, specifically management of scale and diversity, problem solving, and system monitoring and notification. Our goal is to bring together (1) HCI researchers, (2) middleware user interface software developers, and (3) real-world system administrators to form a cross-disciplinary community around this topic.},
