Thus we select the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals as our object of study. Many communities within CHI focus on the constrained and ephemeral nature of resources, including the HCI for Development (HCI4D), Sustainable HCI (SHCI), and Crisis Informatics (CI) communities, among several others. We contend that it is time for these communities to come together in addressing issues of global relevance and impact, and for many more to care. Additionally, as the venue for CHI shifts to Asia in 2021, we aspire to prepare the conference and its participants to grapple with themes that might offer a different and novel perspective when engaged within the Global South.},

In discussions among HCI educators over the past two years, two themes have stood out: creating channels for discussions related to HCI education and providing a platform for sharing HCI curricula and teaching experiences. To that end, we are organizing EduCHI 2020: The 2nd Annual Symposium on HCI Education. Similar to last year's symposium, EduCHI 2020 will again feature paper presentations about HCI education trends, curricula, pedagogies, teaching practices, and diverse and inclusive HCI education. In addition, we will also be adding more opportunities for discussions among and between members of the HCI education community, particularly around solving current and future challenges facing HCI educators.},

The role that technology can play in how people live as they approach end of life as well as in bereavement is full of rich possibilities, but research here is also fraught with ethical and methodological dilemmas. Although there has been a turn to focus on the topic of death by some in HCI we need to go far further to embrace the contexts relating to it more meaningfully and broadly. Through this design focused workshop, we will bring experts and interested parties together to creatively explore opportunities and challenges for HCI at the end of life and beyond. Discussions and design activities will be supported by conceptual resources for design, lived experience accounts, design methods and ethical resources. The workshop will provide a time and place to bring together experts but will also provide an open and accepting environment for those for whom HCI at end of life and beyond is a new area of concern.},

At the same time, the increasing number of smart devices that are becoming part of our everyday life creates new challenges for authentication, in particular since many of those devices are not designed and developed with authentication in mind. Examples include but are not limited to wearables, AR and VR glasses, devices in smart homes, and public displays. The goal of this workshop is to develop a common understanding of challenges and opportunities smart devices and environments create for secure and usable authentication. Therefore, we will bring together researchers and practitioners from HCI, usable security, and specific application areas (e.g., smart homes, wearables) to develop a research agenda for future approaches to authentication.},

To date, much of this attention has revolved around the technical aspect, with related concerns including the creation and implementation of suitable smart city technologies. What is notably missing from these discussions, however, is a consideration of the lived experience of supposedly 'smart spaces' and the extent to which physical and digital environments are currently producing new forms of play and playfulness that can be contextualized within this field. With this in mind, the purpose of our workshop is as follows. First, to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to engage with these issues that often remain hidden when discussions solely focus on technology. Second, to develop a draft research agenda for challenges that will serve as a primer for future studies examining the topic.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) share common roots and early work on conversational agents has laid the foundation for both fields. However, in subsequent decades the initial tight connection between the fields has become less pronounced. The recent rise of deep learning has revolutionized AI and has led to a raft of practical methods and tools that significantly impact areas outside of core-AI. In particular, modern AI techniques now power new ways for machines and humans to interact. Thus it is timely to investigate how modern AI can propel HCI research in new ways and how HCI research can help direct AI developments. This workshop offers a forum for researchers to discuss new opportunities that lie in bringing modern AI methods into HCI research, identifying important problems to investigate, showcasing computational and scientific methods that can be applied, and sharing datasets and tools that are already available or proposing those that should be further developed. The topics we are interested in including deep learning methods for understanding and modeling human behaviors and enabling new interaction modalities, hybrid intelligence that combine human and machine intelligence to solve difficult tasks, and tools and methods for interaction data curation and large-scale data-driven design. At the core of these topics, we want to start the conversation on how data-driven and data-centric approaches of modern AI can impact HCI.},

The resultant bridging of functions across devices, the decision making, the overview, the handling of partially imprecise or conflicting information are often just offloaded to the human. Thus, there appears to be a need to shift the attention from avoiding human error (at operation time) to avoiding error during design. In this workshop, we aim to provide a forum to discuss such a paradigm shift and the implication on the methods and tools for designing and evaluating HCI technology in safety-critical environments},

In HCI, this understanding has been incorporated in concepts like embodied interaction, bodily play, and natural user-interfaces. However, while embodied cognition suggests a strong connection between motor activity and memory, we find the design of technological systems that target this connection to be largely overlooked. Considering this, we are provided with an opportunity to extend human capabilities through augmenting motor memory. Augmentation of motor memory is now possible with the advent of new and emerging technologies including neuromodulation, electric stimulation, brain-computer interfaces, and adaptive intelligent systems. This workshop aims to explore the possibility of augmenting motor memory using these and other technologies. In doing so, we stand to benefit not only from new technologies and interactions, but also a means to further study cognition.},

We hope to convene researchers from broad ranging areas to explore the many ways in which uncertainty appears in our research and the different types of responses that HCI has to offer. There is an incredible variety of conceptual formulations of uncertainty and related ideas like risk, ambiguity, and suspense that raise both difficult challenges as well as significant opportunities for creative engagement with societal challenges. During the workshop, we won't seek to "solve" uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. In doing so, we will experiment with and contribute to new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants.},

By drawing from the diverse interdisciplinary expertise that defines CHI, we are proposing this workshop as a platform on which to build a community that is better equipped to tackle an emerging field that is rapidly-evolving, yet is under-studied --- especially as the commercial advances seem to outpace the scholarly research in this space.},

abstract = {HCI has long considered sites of workplace collaboration. From airline cockpits to distributed groupware systems, scholars emphasize the importance of supporting a multitude of tasks and creating technologies that integrate into collaborative work settings. More recent scholarship highlights a growing need to consider the concerns of workers within and beyond established workplace settings or roles of employment, from steelworkers whose jobs have been eliminated with post-industrial shifts in the economy to contractors performing the content moderation that shapes our social media experiences. This one-day workshop seeks to bring together a growing community of HCI scholars concerned with the labor upon which the future of work we envision relies. We will discuss existing methods for studying work that we find both productive and problematic, with the aim of understanding how we might better bridge current gaps in research, policy, and practice. Such conversations will focus on the challenges associated with taking a worker-oriented approach and outline concrete methods and strategies for conducting research on labor in changing industrial, political, and environmental contexts.},

The goal of this workshop is both to create an overview of this diversity and to move towards a shared vision of design fiction within the CHI community. With this goal in mind, we invite reports, analyses, and examples of design fictions. An outcome will be development of a summary of the current state-of-the-art seeded by a diversity of perspectives within CHI, a descriptive orientation to this important domain of practices and outcomes, and a proposed set of evaluation guidelines for reviewers of design fiction submissions.},

abstract = {With social computing systems and algorithms having been shown to give rise to unintended consequences, one of the suspected success criteria is their ability to integrate and utilize people's inherent cognitive biases. Biases can be present in users, systems and their contents. With HCI being at the forefront of designing and developing user-facing computing systems, we bear special responsibility for increasing awareness of potential issues and working on solutions to mitigate problems arising from both intentional and unintentional effects of cognitive biases. This workshop brings together designers, developers, and thinkers across disciplines to redefine computing systems by focusing on inherent biases in people and systems and work towards a research agenda to mitigate their effects. By focusing on cognitive biases from content or system as well as from a human perspective, this workshop will sketch out blueprints for systems that contribute to advancing technology and media literacy, building critical thinking skills, and depolarization by design.},

However, to date, there are few research efforts that explicitly focus on these overlapping themes (automated driving &amp; climate changes) within the HCI and AutomotiveUI communities. Our intention is to grow this community and awareness of the related problems. Specifically, in this workshop, we invite designers, researchers, and practitioners from the sustainable HCI, persuasive design, AutomotiveUI, and mobility communities to collaborate in finding ways to make future mobility more sustainable. Using embodied design improvisation and design fiction methods, we will explore the ways that systems affect behavior which then affect the environment.},

This has included but is not limited to, work on designing within patriarchal contexts, designing around issues of gender and sexual orientation and designing around literacy. In tandem, local HCI initiatives such as ArabHCI [3] have emerged to address the misrepresentation of these populations in HCI research, highlighting the fact that Western originated design methods would require delicate adaptations to suit non-Western cultural contexts. With the same approach towards inclusivity and co-existence the aim of this workshop is to bring together HCI researchers and practitioners who engage in studies and interventions within Muslim majority communities around the world. The goal is to understand the Muslim identity and perceptions around it, the unique constraints and limitations within Muslim communities and to identify core issues and concerns within these populations. We will explore the following themes: refugees and islamophobia; Muslim feminism and Digital financial services.},

However, despite the recent increase in related CHI publications, older adults continue to be underrepresented in HCI research as well as commercially. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for such research within CHI and related fields such as gerontechnology. For this, we plan to create a space for discussing and sharing principles and strategies to design interactions and evaluate user interfaces (UI) for the ageing population. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of UIs for older adults. Building on the success of last two year's workshops, we aim to grow the community of CHI researchers across borders interested in this topic by fostering a space to exchange results, methods, approaches, and ideas from research on interactive applications in support of older adults that are reflective of international diversity that is representative of CHI.},

abstract = {Immersive virtual experiences are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. Besides visual and auditory feedback, other senses like haptics, smell and taste can enhance immersion in virtual environments. Most solutions presented in the past require specialized hardware to provide appropriate feedback. To mitigate this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical objects as proxies instead. Transferring these approaches to varying physical environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design, etc. This workshop will explore the integration of everyday items for multi-sensory feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research endeavors. Since the community still seems to lack a cohesive agenda for advancing this domain, the goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals interested in everyday proxy objects to review past work, build a unifying research agenda, share ongoing work, and encourage collaboration.},

However, recent literature demonstrates that individuals managing mental illness often incorporate a variety of technologies into their self-management routines, including texting, music, wearables, online communities, games, and social media. Therefore, adopting a perspective focused on understanding the technology ecosystem of mental health management may be a better approach than focusing on singular platforms and applications. In this CHI workshop, we will examine a constellation of digital and non-digital mental health support resources. We will discuss the needs and practices of individuals managing mental illness, how these needs relate to future ecosystems of technologies and services, and the potentials and repercussions of current technologies. By convening a group of interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners, we will collectively address these topics to create resources attentive to individuals' lived experiences with mental illness, goals with respect to management and recovery, and interactions with existing forms of resources, care, and technology.},

abstract = {As AI changes the way decisions are made in organizations and governments, it is ever more important to ensure that these systems work according to values that diverse users and groups find important. Researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic techniques to formalize statistical fairness notions, but emerging work suggests that AI systems must account for the real-world contexts in which they will be embedded in order to actually work fairly. These findings call for an expanded research focus beyond statistical fairness to that which includes fundamental understandings of human use and the social impact of AI systems, a theme central to the HCI community. The HCI community can contribute novel understandings, methods, and techniques for incorporating human values and cultural norms into AI systems; address human biases in developing and using AI; and empower individual users and society to audit and control AI systems. Our goal is to bring together academic and industry researchers in the fields of HCI, ML and AI, and the social sciences to devise a cross-disciplinary research agenda for fair and responsible AI systems. This workshop will build on previous algorithmic fairness workshops at AI and ML conferences, map research and design opportunities for future innovations, and disseminate them in each community.},

This workshop will address socio-methodological issues at play across design contexts, and build a community comprised of those who seek to support the expression and inclusion of diverse needs, abilities, and experiences in design. Research often involves participants who communicate in ways which are in line with assumed social norms and practices (e.g. those who communicate verbally), while those who communicate differently can be under-represented in design research. We highlight a need to broaden the inclusion and support of communities who have different communication needs, including; people with functional communication impairments, neurodiverse people, people who experience adverse life situations or trauma, people who are discriminated against or under-represented, and many, many other individuals and communities. We aim to unpick - and develop pragmatic solutions to - several challenges around working with diverse communities in research and practice, producing functional guidelines for design research in this area and problematising current methods and terminology.},

Normative and privileged lenses can impair conceptualizations of identities and privacy needs, as well as reinforce or exacerbate power structures and struggles-and how they are formalized within privacy research methods, theories, designs, and analytical tools. The aim of this one-day workshop is to facilitate discourse around alternative ways of thinking about privacy and power, as well as ways for researching and designing technologies that not only respect the privacy needs of vulnerable populations but attempt to empower them. We will work towards developing best practices to help academics and industry folks, technologists, researchers, policy makers, and designers do a better job of serving the privacy needs of vulnerable users of technology.},

abstract = {Conversational agents have increasingly been deployed in healthcare applications. However, significant challenges remain in developing this technology. Recent research in this area has highlighted that: i) patient safety was rarely evaluated; ii) health outcomes were poorly measured, and iii) no standardised evaluation methods were employed. The conversational agents in healthcare are lagging behind the developments in other domains. This one-day workshop aims to create a roadmap for healthcare conversational agents to develop standardised design and evaluation frameworks. This will prioritise health outcomes and patient safety while ensuring a high-quality user experience. In doing so, this workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from HCI, healthcare and related speech and chatbot domains to collaborate on these key challenges.},

At the city-scale, this is studied in the field of 'digital civics'; however, there seems to be no corresponding focus at the level of buildings/building inhabitants. The majority of our lives are spent indoors and therefore the impact that 'indoor digital civics' may have, might exceed that of city-scale, digital civics. The digitization of building design and building management creates an opportunity to better identify, protect, and cultivate civic values that, until now, were centralized in the hands of building designers and building owners. By bringing together leading architecture/HCI academics and commercial stakeholders, this workshop builds on previous workshops at CHI. The workshop will provide a forum where a new agenda for research in 'HabiTech' can be defined and new research collaborations formed.},

It asks: How can we as a community recognize and address and incorporate the very real critiques of our current systems to produce a more thoughtful, just, equitable field and world? What actions can we take-beyond virtue signaling and slacktivism-that will effect meaningful change within the community and beyond?

abstract = {Virtual and augmented realities (VR/AR) allow artists to create 3D content in a three-dimensional space — both display and inputs are 3D. Getting rid of 2D proxies such as screens and graphic tablets removes a significant barrier from 3D creation and allows artists to create more intuitively, and potentially more efficiently. However, creating in VR/AR introduces new control, precision, and ergonomic challenges. Designing interactive tools for 3D creation is therefore non-trivial. A deep understanding of human factors, user preferences, as well as biases stemming from users' experience with 2D tools is essential to develop effective creative tools for VR/AR. My research combines exploratory user studies and technical advancements to build novel tools for creating 3D content in immersive spaces. I present two computer graphics applications which utilize 3D interactions to improve existing creative workflows and devise novel ones for visual creative expression in three-dimensions. The first studies concept sketching, while the second explores animation of dynamic physical phenomena. I then describe my ongoing work and planned future work on other creative applications.},

Therefore, it is very important for them to maintain their physical prowess by encouraging the performance of physical activity. Previous research has focused primarily on physical activity as a single task without consideration of numerous additional coinciding events that almost always co-occur. The most common concomitant, secondary task (i.e., dual-task) is related to the cognitive requirements associated with daily activity pursuits. Thus, any procedure designed to promote greater physical activity should include complex tasks. In addition, the older population is diverse, and therefore, physical activity should be personalized according to individual capabilities and skills. We intend to combine navigation as a secondary task to walking, as a task "instructor", guiding the users through their personalized routes and also provide an added value of doing physical activity outside the home.},

My prior work studies voice-based communities on Discord, and shows that voice as a new technology brings unique challenges to community moderators and highlights the fundamental evidentiary need in content moderation. My dissertation expands on this work by (1) quantifying severity of violations as a way to address social media platforms' challenge of prioritization, and (2) empirically evaluating existing moderation approaches and design recommendations by soliciting moderator and user perceptions of them. Combining these perspectives, my dissertation will provide guidelines for improving content moderation in online communities.},

abstract = {Visual data exploration enables users to identify trends and patterns, generate and verify hypotheses, and detect outliers and anomalies. However, the growing scale and complexity of data exploration present a barrier to discovering useful, actionable insights from data. Often, users may not know which visualizations would lead to desirable insights, resulting in wasted efforts in manual searching. Users can also be overwhelmed or lose track of where to look across a large potential space of attributes and filter combinations, leading to missed insights or even potentially erroneous conclusions. My thesis research involves designing systems that democratize data science by providing automated guidance to analysts in visual data exploration. My current work includes accelerating manual data exploration tasks and supporting user exploration in analytical workflows. Finally, I will describe future work in developing a high-level language for addressing analytical inquiries.},

The impromptu nature of these meetings makes scheduling sign-language interpreting or professional captioning services difficult. Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology could help remove some of these barriers that prevent DHH people from becoming involved in group meetings. However, ASR is still imperfect, and it contains errors in its output text in many real-world conversation settings. My research proposes to investigate whether there are benefits in using ASR technology to aid understanding and communication among DHH and hearing individuals. My dissertation research will evaluate the effectiveness of using ASR in small group meetings (through empirical studies with DHH and hearing participants), as well as develop guidelines for system design to encourage hearing participants to communicate and speak more clearly.},

In contrast to this new ease of producing new forms, fabricating objects that can sense user input traditionally requires the assembly of complex circuits and physical parts. With my work, I explore what I call pap: 3D-printed interactive objects without requiring any post-print activities such as assembly or calibration. I approach this by by externally sensing how the user's actions interact with well-studied physical phenomena (e.g., acoustic resonance and fluid dynamics). I have developed two novel techniques using this principle: , a blow-based interaction technique for fabricated objects using acoustic resonance; and , a technique for fabricating touch-sensitive objects using pneumatic sensing and fluid dynamics principles.},

Although legislation for online safety exists, they are enforced in few countries throughout the region, and there are few cases of victims being heard in court.

A case study reveals that design students are able to take all four considerations into account in the application of the IAC. However, the fourth consideration - to take contextual considerations into account - poses a significant challenge to them. Our discussion of this finding leads us to two obstacles for the application of the IAC in design education. Based on this discussion, we concluded that the fourth consideration may have to be replaced by the consideration to let the context of use directly inform the design process.},

We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic – AI and Space – our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses – such as AI – through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach.

We tested the accessibility of virtual reality (VR) as a modality for training PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) employees, and we observed negative and positive sentiments associated with various approaches to VR engagement. This case study presents our efforts to improve VR headset onboarding and game play experience by analyzing user experience from the time they show up for the VR learning experience to the time they leave. We describe learner capabilities and skills required to interact with the headset and voice-recognition technology in a simulation based learning experience, the methods we used to identify user sentiments and infer causes, as well as our efforts to address user needs by adjusting our VR learner experience design. In selecting our test user population, we attempted to represent the diversity of PwC learner demographics, including gender, ethnicity, employee role / function, practice group within PwC, and other characteristics that could have had a material impact on VR equipment use, such as prior experience with VR, use of eyeglasses, and presence of various accents when speaking. Our heterogenous group of testers pushed us to acknowledge user sensitivities, which we had previously underestimated. We changed our VR onboarding protocol in order to mitigate reticence to learning in VR. We believe that as the technology becomes more prevalent in the enterprise and more employees experience the value VR brings to the training experience, the overall sentiment toward VR will continue to improve. We hope our study motivates continued research to improve accessibility of VR technology, enterprise implementation of VR, user-interface design, and voice recognition technologies used in gameplay.},

Primary caregivers report being able to better understand these individuals' non-traditional utterances than those less familiar with the individual such as teachers and community members. We present an eight-month multi-phase case study for a translational platform, ECHOS, that uses primary caregivers' unique knowledge to enhance communicative and affective exchanges between mvASD individuals and the broader community. Through iterative development and participatory design, we discovered that physiological sensors were impractical for long-term use, on-body audio was content rich and easily accessible, and a custom in-the-moment labeling app was transformative in obtaining accurate labels from caregivers for machine learning advancements. This paper presents the design methodology, results, and reflections from our case study and provides insights into development with and for the special needs community.},

abstract = {One of the most intriguing features of the human-computer interaction is that human users rarely use full-fledged natural language utterances when communicating with computers. I investigate properties of linguistic expressions that arise in the context of human-computer interaction, focusing specifically on word order in search queries. I report results of two experimental studies that suggest that word order is meaningful and communicates user intent: the attribute that is more important or desirable to the user tends to be mentioned first. Study 1A and Study 1B show that these results hold for typed and spoken queries. Study 2 suggests that users do not have meta-awareness of this strategy. These findings can contribute to a better detection of user intent. Incorporation of word order sensitivity into technology design can lead to more efficient and satisfactory human-computer interactions.},

abstract = {In recent years, the retail industry has increasingly gained interest in the ICT system for enriching the customers' shopping experience and is now being deployed in some stores. As the most common implementation method is limited with its high cost and large consumption of space, it is a challenge for smaller or temporal stores to install such services. In this paper, we explore the usage of a load-sensitive board to improve the retail shopping experience specifically in smaller and temporal stores. As a case study, we develop and examine KI/OSK, an easy-to-install modular table-top retail application using SCALE a previously developed load sensing toolkit specifically for the Farmers Market. Our study uses iterative user research including surveys with Farmer's Market managers to assess design requirements, and testing and revising through a field study in a Farmers Market.},

The narratives contained within the album were designed in cooperation with assisted care home residents with dementia. However, due to the progression of their dementia, adaptions to standard interviewing processes for gathering the narratives were needed. Through the use of multi-sensory stimulates (visual and somatic), over time, we were able to understand our participants' narratives as well as their personhood. Furthermore, the adaptions led to questioning the importance of narrative accuracy and the ultimate purpose of building the albums. The next phase is to evaluate the long-term effects of the creation process and the albums themselves.},

abstract = {Satellites have useful lifetimes of only a few decades; however, these could easily be extended if consumable resources could be replaced. Many groups are now exploring the possibility of using unmanned orbital robots to perform satellite servicing operations. These orbiting robots are currently semi-autonomous and require monitoring and control by highly trained ground teams in order to complete their activities. This provides for a unique and tightly constrained operating environment with very particular interface needs. Here, we document the process we used for developing a tele-robotic interface specific to NASA's Restore-L mission, and describe the choices and considerations we weighed when implementing our designs. We discuss the technical and mission parameters as well as the social and operational context of our work, and articulate the need for a design framework that is capable of better connecting these two domains.},

abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of teleoperated robots have been used to provide services from a remote location. Most earlier teleoperated robot systems informed the customers that the robots are being remotely controlled, while the customers believed that they were communicating with the operators through the robots. However, it has already been shown that there are some disadvantages in informing customers about the robot teleoperation. To investigate whether customers could accept and use teleoperated robots that acted as if they were autonomous, we developed a teleoperated system in which operators represent autonomous robots. Our system was experimentally tested by employing operators that provided services to customers in a real field. It was found that many customers were particularly satisfied with the service of the teleoperated robots that behaved as if they were autonomous, while we demonstrated that customers who did not realize the robot teleoperation rated the service higher than the customers who realized the same.},

abstract = {Through technological advancements more and more companies consider virtual reality (VR) for training of their workforce, in particular for situations that occur rarely, are dangerous, expensive, or very difficult to recreate in the real world. This creates the need for understanding the potentials and limitations of VR training and establish best practices. In pursuit of this, we have developed a VR Training simulation for a use case at Grundfos, in which apprentices learn a sequential maintenance task. We evaluated this simulation in a user study with 36 participants, comparing it to two traditional forms of training (Pairwise Training and Video Training). This case study describes the developed virtual training scenario and discusses design considerations for such VR simulations. The results of our evaluation support that, while VR Training is effective in teaching the procedure for a maintenance task, traditional approaches with hands-on experience still lead to a significantly better outcome.},

Although the combination of state-of-the-art technology with human expertise is undoubtedly valuable in the industry context, designing a user-centered tool that fits in the everyday activities of knowledge workers – supporting and augmenting their potential – is not a trivial work. User research uncovers pain points and opportunities, bringing the insights that inspire designers and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) experts. It allows a clear understanding of the context, which is the essence of a consistent interaction experience. Nevertheless, revealing the UX of the application and how AI in this context reshapes knowledge workers' everyday tasks is not straightforward and might also be an iterative process. In this paper, we present findings from a case study of the use of a storytelling method to design and validate the UX of AI assistants for the Oil &amp; Gas industry by using an animated sketch-based video.},

For this, 25 users assessed two types of avatar animations, one upper baseline generated utilizing motion capture data, and a reference with absolute total positional differences in the mm range generated utilizing machine learned synthetic data. As expected, user evaluation of the synthesized references showed a considerable loss in rating scores. We therefore computed a variety of signal-specific differences between both data types and investigated their correlations to the collected user ratings. Results reveal general statistically significant inter-dependencies of avatar movement and perception helpful for the generation of any type of virtual avatar in the future. However, results also suggest that it is difficult to determine concrete avatar features with a high influence on the user perception in the current study design.},

abstract = {The media industry has a practice of reusing news content, which may be a surprise to news consumers. Whether by agreement or plagiarism, a lack of explicit citations makes it difficult to understand where news comes from and how it spreads. We reveal news provenance by reconstructing the history of near-duplicate news in the web index - identifying the origins of republished content and the impact of original content. By aggregating provenance information and presenting it as part of news search results, users may be able to make more informed decisions about which articles to read and which publishers to trust. We report on early analysis and user feedback, highlighting the critical tension between the desire for media transparency and the risks of disrupting an already fragile ecosystem.},

abstract = {While much research has been done on games as engaging strategies for assessment and education, little has been done to address the specific human computer interaction questions relating to the impact of player engagement in game experiences. This case study examines a section (284 adults) of a larger study on play preference of over 700 participants who were given four versions of an assessment game. While the content remained the same, the versions varied by their structure (rewarding players for acting either appropriately or inappropriately) and by play perspective aesthetics (direct or indirect character embodiment). The results indicate that player preference was for the aesthetics of indirect embodiment and the goals of negative behavior. While this is perhaps unsurprising to makers of commercial games, this is contrary to typical education assessment game design. The case study also demonstrates a difference in player character embodiment that should prove useful to those determining the perspective of their player environments.},

abstract = {We performed an ex situ Wizard of Oz study of young adults interacting with an idealized digital personal assistant to discuss daily scheduling concerns and stress levels. We further varied rates of "learning" and personalization with the system to test user preferences and changes in participants' linguistic and psychological interactions with an unadapted versus adapted user model, and to determine whether those changes were attributable to acclimatization with the system or to the modeling capabilities, seeking to address 3 research questions: What are the psycholinguistic characteristics of user interactions with a dialogue system designed to act as a scheduling assistant? How does a system's ability to learn about a user and maintain a user model affect these interactions? Are changes in interaction styles uniquely attributable to user modeling ability rather than simply user familiarity or acclimation with the system? We present a linguistic analysis of the results using summary measures generated by a widely used psycholinguistic text analysis tool. Some of the measures seem to present the slightly paradoxical effect of reduced user engagement when a conversational agent explicitly discloses information about its user model to the user. These results suggest that future studies should take care to consider the degree to which the user model is directly exposed to the user. That is, being overly forthcoming about what has been learned about a user may undermine attempts to tailor conversational agents to actively engage and relate to users.},

The rise of crowdsourcing platforms, in which a variety of tasks are offered in the form of an open call, might be an alternative source to help educators scale up project- based learning. But how do university students feel about executing crowdsourcing tasks instead of their typical assignments? In a study with 24 industrial design students we investigate students' attitudes on introducing crowdsourcing tasks as assignments. Based on our study we offer four suggestions to universities that consider integrating crowdsourcing tasks in their educational activities.},

We are seeing use cases as diverse as education and pain management, with new applications being imagined every day. Virtual Reality technology comes with new challenges, and many obstacles need to be overcome to ensure good user experience. Recently many new Virtual Reality systems with integrated eye-tracking have become available. At the same time, many research labs are using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to non-invasively measure brain activity and serve as a brain-computer interface. This course presents timely, relevant information on how Virtual Reality can leverage eye-tracking and brain activity data to optimize the user experience and to alleviate usability issues surrounding many challenges in immersive VEs. The integration of these sensors allows us to determine additional insights into human behavior, including where the viewer is focusing their attention, and monitor cognitive load. Advancing these approaches could make the Virtual Reality experience more comfortable, safe and effective for the user, and open a new world to facilitate new experimentation for Human Computer Interaction (and Brain Computer Interaction) researchers.},

However, these discussions have largely centered around member-researcher status and positionality when working with queer populations. Based on insights gathered at multiple ACM events over the past year, we identified two pressing issues: (1) we need to better support queer people doing HCI research not specific to queer populations, and (2) we need to identify how to best support member-researchers in leading Queer HCI while including collaborators beyond the queer community. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to directly address these challenges by convening a broad community of queer researchers and allies, working not only on explicitly-queer topics but across a broad range of HCI topics.},

abstract = {Whilst studying Human-Computer Interaction, students and work-place learners rarely encounter sketching, yet such practice has been shown to improve cognitive processes and increase retention of information. Additionally, it is a valuable method of ideation and communication for both subjective and group-based projects. We propose further integration of sketching practice within HCI and computer science curricula, both to preserve this valuable skill for use in research and industry, and to widen the perspectives of those working with subjects often seen as grounded in code or logic. SketCHI #3 will bring together those interested in enhancing student's and colleagues experience in a hands-on meeting of minds and sketching, with the aim to share best practice and knowledge for those interested in expanding our views on education in the field, and to co-create a Sketching in HCI education plan with a body of knowledge.},

Yet from an end-user perspective, we already live in an era of seemingly sentient agents. Virtual personal assistants are now ubiquitous on mobile and smart home devices. But as long as human-level artificial intelligence remains speculative, the ability of today's pseudo-sentient agents to understand and fulfill the full range of human user demands is, by definition, limited and failure-prone. We need better strategies for designing natural, graceful, failure-tolerant user experiences with pseudo-sentient agents. To better support researchers and practitioners actively working on this problem, we propose a Special Interest Group at CHI 2020: a pop-up studio to design the near-future of user interactions with pseudo-sentient agents.},

abstract = {Eye movement recording has been extensively used in HCI and offers the possibility to understand how information is perceived and processed by users. Hardware developments provide the ubiquitous accessibility of eye recording, allowing eye movements to enter common usage as a control modality. Recent A.I. developments provide powerful computational means to make predictions about the user. However, the connection between eye movements and cognitive state has been largely under-exploited in HCI. Despite the rich literature in psychology, a deeper understanding of its usability in practice is still required. This EMICS SIG will provide an opportunity to discuss possible application scenarios and HCI interfaces to infer users' mental state from eye movements. It will bring together researchers across disciplines with the goal of expanding shared knowledge, discussing innovative research directions and methods, fostering future collaborations around the use of eye movements as an interface to cognitive state, and providing a solid foundation for an EMICS workshop at CHI 2021.},

The study found that facts from an expert, rather than stories from experts or peers, remain the most effective form of training. Here we replicate and extend this study by targeting current college students. The results show that college students respond differently than university staff and are more receptive to social stories or facts from peers. These results indicate the importance of taking the target demographic into account when designing and conducting phishing training.},

In this work, I build upon a hybrid discussion and document-writing tool called Wikum+ to allow groups to mix having discussions and summarizing those discussions in real-time, until the process results in a final document that incorporates and links all discussion points. I conduct a pilot study where a group used Wikum+ to collaboratively write a proposal, while a control group used a messaging platform along with Google Docs. From analyzing survey and interview results, I found preliminary evidence that Wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized as well as more inclusive of ideas in the final document. Wikum+ allowed for more light-weight coordination and iterative improvements through the incorporation of new ideas.},

Knowledge Maps (KM) introduces three process management mechanisms to help learners understand examples: highlighted CSS properties, interactive CSS properties, and guided reflection prompts. In a user study where 9 users interacted with the Knowledge Maps (KM) platform on two examples using CSS grid layout, learners were able to understand the pros and cons between the CSS grid layout technique used in each example. Learners also demonstrated that they could apply their understanding to new use cases.},

abstract = {Scatterplots are one of the most common data visualisation methods. Designing scatterplots for large data sets is challenging, as overlapping markers are likely to cause loss of information. Poorly chosen marker opacity, shape, or size may lead to e.g. overplotting or diminished visibility of outliers. The challenge is amplified by having to wait for rendering every time the design is changed. To reduce designer effort, optimisation-based approaches to scatterplot design have been proposed, most comprehensive being an algorithm by Micallef et al. (2017) that applies image-based perceptual quality measures to automatic evaluation of scatterplots. However, their approach suffers also from poor rendering performance, discouraging usage in interactive applications. This paper presents an algorithm applying abstract rendering for efficiently updating scatterplot markers regardless of data set size. We show how our approach enables fast, interactive design and adjustment of overlap in scatterplots, demonstrated with a proof-of-concept visualisation tool.},

abstract = {In response to the severe lack of video games geared towards individuals with visual impairment and blindness, we designed and developed a maze game ("Lost in Spaze") that can be enjoyed by players of varying visual ability. Using controllers, players navigate through four mazes of increasing difficulty, guided by audio cues indicating what direction they should take. Given that Lost in Spaze is a video game, there is still a visual component that is not meant to be used by players. However, the visual component may allow a non-player audience who are not visually impaired or blind to engage in the fun of this local multiplayer party game.},

Headphones embedded within the stethoscope play distinct sounds when the dial approaches each number in the sequence. Once the player has identified all 3 numbers in the combination, the safe unlocks and opens, revealing different treasures depending on the selected difficulty level.},

Chronic pain manifests in many different forms and imposes immense physical limitations on the sufferer's body. However, the social and mental issues associated with chronic pain are often overlooked. Although modern medicine alleviates the physical symptoms of chronic pain, it fails to address issues that feast on the sufferer's mental health. Moreover, awareness, acceptance and empathy towards the sufferers are lacking in the society. On the other side is an interactive narrative that employs gameplay as a medium to induce empathy and awareness about social stigmatization and isolation that patients with chronic pain conditions face. The narrative transports the player into the troubled life of a chronic pain patient and their altered relationship with their own body.},

Using a human-centred design process, we gathered user requirements and developed a multisensory educational group game in which players have to cooperate to control an animal and avoid harmful or collect helpful items using voice and movement. Users who played the game during a final Wizard-of-Oz user test found the game highly engaging, successful in raising awareness, and reported increased motivation to take action in their personal lives.

Drawing from Latin American decolonial thinking, we reflect on our experiences as Latin American students seeking a graduate education in the United States. From there, we discuss paths for HCI educators and students to engage with the co-creation of pluriversal learning spaces that resist universal notions of language, class content, and knowledge production. As we build a more inclusive research community, these discussions become critical for imagining an HCI education aware of its social and political dimensions.},

Describing an alternate future where assistant presences live inside objects, this approach foregrounds some of the phenomenological quirks that can otherwise easily become lost. Divorced from the reality of daily life, this approach allows us to reevaluate some of the common interactions and design patterns that are common in the virtual assistants of the present.},

We hypothesize that the adoption of this heuristic might affect user behaviour and present a diet plan for users who wish to take responsibility for their own e-waste by eating it.

abstract = {Computer-generated algorithmic art has undergone significant developments since its emergence in the 1960s. With further integration of art and technology in the 21st century, artists continue to respond, take risks and challenge the ways computers can be thought of as a creative medium. This project specifically addresses speculative forms of artificial intelligence particularly the possibilities for creative collaboration between human and machine-generated embodiments of poetic expression. The Artificial Creative Intelligence (ACI) is a fictional AI Poet whose spoken word poetry signals the horizon of a new type of authorship that questions the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence for creative practitioners.},

abstract = {While the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field widely recognises the need for interdisciplinarity, academic traditions from older fields still limit the scope of cross-disciplinary discourse. As HCI scholars come from a variety of backgrounds, developing new HCI-specific research agendas requires a deep immersion in a cross-disciplinary discussion and a thorough understanding of those with a different academic upbringing. This may be difficult in the eventful life of an HCI academic. In this paper, we propose a twelve-step programme that helps foster a better cross-disciplinary discourse. Having successfully survived a multitude of intense arguments between a computer scientist and a psychologist, we offer an easy way to have fruitful and civilised cross-disciplinary discussions. Our programme is designed to help HCI academics broaden their mind and interface with other disciplines while preserving their sanity.},

Specifically, we embed the memories of an elderly woman inside a micro-organism by means of computing and genetic engineering. To do so, we first encoded the stories into a string of nucleotides. We next designed and fabricated a circular string by appending restriction enzymes and backbone genes. We developed specific bio-protocols to insert the fabricated molecule inside Komagataeibacter rhaeticus bacteria. The transformed bacteria were presented in an exhibition as a sculpture - Semina Aeternitatis, containing billions of copies of the original stories that people could see, touch, smell and taste. Our work is a first step towards a future where the interaction with our past will go beyond words, and take a more tangible format.},

IOAIL was established to overcome the eruption of obscure AI technology. One of the primary goals of IOAIL is the development of a proficient certification body providing knowledge to users regarding the AI technology they are being exposed to. To this end IOAIL produced a system of standardised icons for attaching to products and systems to indicate both the presence of AI and to increase the legibility of that AI's attributes. Whilst the process of certification is voluntary it is becoming a mark of trust, enhancing the usability and acceptability of AI-infused products through improved legibility. In this paper we present our experience of seeking certification for a locally implemented AI security system, highlighting the issues generated for those seeking to adopt such certification.},

abstract = {What for and how will we design children's technologies in the transhumanism age, and what stance will we take as designers? This paper aims to answer this question with 13 fictional abstracts from sixteen authors of different countries, institutions and disciplines. Transhumanist thinking envisions enhancing human body and mind by blending human biology with technological augmentations. Fundamentally, it seeks to improve the human species, yet the impacts of such movement are unknown and the implications on children's lives and technologies were not explored deeply. In an age, where technologies such as under-skin chips or brain-machine interfaces can clearly be defined as transhumanist, our aim is to reveal probable pitfalls and benefits of those technologies on children's lives by using the power of design fiction. Thus, main contribution of this paper is to create diverse presentation of provocative research ideas that will foster the discussion on the transhumanist technologies impacting the lives of children in the future.},

I present a situated analysis of a CHI paper, "Design for Collaborative Survival," to propose an embodied method of reading through situated action that enables communication and expansion of the knowledge beyond the text. I responded to each of the concepts in that paper in an active way to better approach the authors' tacit knowledge by developing my own. Through this activity I intend to stimulate discussion on how authors and readers can benefit from similar methods that take reading beyond the text.},

abstract = {We present MicroAquarium, a new hybrid digital-biological installation that provides an immersive experience of interacting with real living cells. MicroAquarium uses a custom-built light-projection microscope equipped with an interactive input device and an immersive display to mediate the interaction between humans and microorganisms. Users' hand motions are recognized and converted into a pattern of light that is projected onto the photo-tactic microorganisms inside the microscope. The view inside the microscope is displayed on a large screen display, providing users with an immersive experience of being inside an aquarium of living cells. Our system effectively bridges the differences in size and the sensing modalities between human users and microscopic organisms and allows for unique playful and exploratory inter-species interactions.},

It is a unique artificial reality experience that allows viewers to cross the so-called fourth wall between the film reality and the audience's reality. The experience allows the viewer to "enter" a film frame via a mixed reality tabletop experience. To our knowledge, "Vera" is the first immersive experience that utilizes both volumetric capture (instead of avatar animation) and photogrammetric reconstruction of the set decoration and props. It is also the first experiment that literally rather than metaphorically crosses the fourth wall.},

abstract = {The golden hour following a traumatic injury holds the highest likelihood where surgical treatment may prevent mortality and morbidity. However, the increasing occurrence of large-scale disasters, overwhelm local medical systems and patients find themselves without timely access to medical expertise. To respond to this problem medical care experts are exploring telemedicine, which typically attempts to use synchronous audiovisual communication. While current telemedicine approaches have limited ability to impact the physical care required for trauma, AR technology allows medical professionals to see their patients while seeing additional digital information. In this paper we describe ARTEMIS (Augmented Reality Technology to Enable reMote Integrated Surgery), an immersive AR-VR telementoring infrastructure that allows experienced surgeons to remotely aid less experienced medical professionals in the field. ARTEMIS provides Mixed Reality immersive visual aids by tracking a patient in real-time and showing a reconstructed 3D point cloud in a VR environment; expert surgeons can interact with the 3D point cloud representation of the patient, instruct the remote novice through real-time 3D annotations projected in AR on the patient's body, using hand-maneuvers shown in AR through an avatar of the expert surgeon, and by projecting small video clips of specific procedures in the AR space for the novice to follow.},

abstract = {We introduce an advanced computer vision-based AI system that offers people with vision impairments (VI) dynamic, in-situ access to information about the location, identity and gaze-direction of other people nearby. Our AI system utilizes the camera technology of a head-worn HoloLens device, which captures a near 180° field-of-view surrounding the person who is wearing it. Captured images are then processed by multiple state-of-the-art perception algorithms whose outputs are integrated into a real-time tracking model of all people that the system detected. Users can receive information about those people acoustically (via spatialized audio) using a wrist-worn input controller. Having such dynamic access to information, through AI system interactions, enables people with VI to: develop their communication skills; more easily focus on others; and be more confident in their social interactions. Thus, our work explores how AI systems can serve as a useful resource for humans, helping expand their agency to develop new or extend existing skills.},

We demonstrate versatile compositions techniques that allow to create complex circuits, utilize commodity textile accessories and sketch custom-shaped I/O modules.

We present FoodFab, a system that allows users to control their food intake through modifying a food's internal structure via two 3D printing parameters: infill pattern and infill density. In two experiments with a total of 30 participants, we studied the effect of these parameters on users' chewing time that is known to affect people's feeling of satiety. Our results show that we can indeed modify the chewing time by varying infill pattern and density, and thus control perceived satiety. Based on the results, we propose two computational models and integrate them into a user interface that simplifies the creation of personalized food structures.},

abstract = {We present a demonstration of Chasm, a broadband screw-based linear actuator that renders rich and expressive haptic feedback on wearable and handheld devices. Chasm renders low-frequency skin-stretch and high-frequency vibrations, both simultaneously and independently, through a single tactor and thereby augmenting user interactions with multidimensional haptic feedback in a light and compact form factor. We embody Chasm in a marker-shaped prototype and integrate it with a virtual reality headset through a robust software framework for real-time control of haptic features. We develop a set of VR scenarios to demonstrate rich tactile feedback rendered with the handheld marker and augment the user experience with feeling of impacts, textures, object stiffness and weight on the hand.},

abstract = {We propose ElastOscillation, mounted on a virtual reality(VR) controller to provide 3D multilevel force feedback for damped oscillation to enhance VR experiences. ElastOscillation consists of a proxy, six elastic bands and DC motors. It leverages the motors to control the bands' elasticity to restrain the movement of the proxy, which is connected with the bands. Therefore, when users shake the ElastOscillation device, the proxy shakes or moves in the corresponding movement ranges or levels. The users then perceive the force from oscillation in different levels. In addition, elastic force from the bands further reinforces the oscillation force feedback. In the demonstration, users can explore four VR applications that feel the sensation of pan-flipping, bartender-shaking, wine-swirling and fishing.},

abstract = {While standard VR controllers lack means to convey realistic, kinesthetic impressions of size, resistance or inertia, this demonstration presents Drag:on, an ungrounded shape-changing interaction device that provides dynamic passive haptic feedback based on drag, i.e. air resistance, and weight shift. Drag:on leverages the airflow at the controller during interaction. The device adjusts its surface area to change the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. When rotated or swung, Drag:on, conveys an impression of resistance, which we previously used in a VR user study to increase the haptic realism of virtual objects and interactions compared to standard controllers. Drag:on's feedback is suitable for rendering virtual mechanical resistances, virtual gas streams, and virtual objects differing in scale, material and fill state. In our demonstration, participants learn about this novel feedback concept, the implementation of our prototype and can experience the resistance feedback during a hands-on session.},

abstract = {Most widespread haptic feedback devices for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) fall into one of two categories: simple hand-held controllers with a single vibration actuator, or complex glove systems with several embedded actuators. In this work, we explore haptic feedback on the wrist for interacting with virtual objects. We use Tasbi, a compact bracelet device capable of rendering complex multisensory squeeze and vibrotactile feedback. Leveraging Tasbi's haptic rendering, and using standard visual and audio rendering of a head mounted display, we present several interactions that tightly integrate sensory substitutive haptics with visual and audio cues. Interactions include push/pull buttons, rotary knobs, textures, rigid body weight and inertia, and several custom bimanual manipulations such as shooting an arrow from a bow. These demonstrations suggest that wrist-based haptic feedback substantially improves virtual hand-based interactions in AR/VR compared to no haptic feedback.},

While different buttons have varying haptic qualities, few works have attempted to dynamically render such tactility, which limits designers from freely exploring buttons' haptic design. We extend the typical force-displacement (FD) model with vibration (V) and velocity-dependence characteristics (V) to form a novel FDVV model. We then introduce Press'Em, a 3D-printed prototype capable of simulating button tactility based on FDVV models. To drive Press'Em, an end-to-end simulation pipeline is presented that covers (1) capturing any physical buttons, (2) controlling the actuation signals, and (3) simulating the tactility. Our system can go beyond replicating existing buttons to enable designers to emulate and test non-existent ones with desired haptic properties. Press'Em aims to be a tool for future research to better understand and iterate over button designs.},

We leverage four types of geometric patterns: rotational erection system (RES), split-fold waterbomb (SFWB), the overlaid structure of SFWB and RES (SFWB+RES), and cylindrical origami, to render different sets of haptic feedback (i.e., linear, bistable, snap-through, and angular rotational force behaviors, respectively). In each structure, form factor and force feedback properties can be tuned through geometric parameters. Based on the experimental results and analysis, we implemented software to automatically generate 2D patterns for desired haptic properties. We also showcased five example applications: assistive input interfaces, rotational switch, multi-sensory toy, task checklist, and phone accessories. We believe the Kirigami Haptic Swatches helps tinkerers, designers, and even researchers to create interactions that enrich our haptic experience.},

As embodiment of such soft mobility, we prototyped "poimo" (POrtable and Inflatable MObility). To evaluate the poimo, we first conducted mechanical tests to verify that it can endure the weight of a human. We also measured the time needed to inflate / deflate it to demonstrate its property. Finally, we reported on the preliminary results of riding on it, and clarified the requirements to further investigate and implement soft mobility transport.},

abstract = {Elastic Legs Illusion (ELI) provides the striking illusory experience of having a longer legs where the virtual legs are visually stretched from the first-person perspective. This illusion works without any experimenter's assist; a single subject wearing a HMD sits on a floor with both legs stretched straight out against a wooden-plate and pulls backward a handle connected with rubber-material tube, that is anchored at the plate. A weight scale (Wii Balance Board) is placed sandwiched between the both legs and the plate where the more strongly the subject pulls the handle the more load is transferred to both legs as well as to the weight scale. ELI correlates this increment of the weight scale with the stretch ratio of the legs in HMD space. Thus, the sense of legs being pushed back against the plate is transformed into a sense of having longer legs. The system was tested in our laboratory exhibition, showing 33 out of 44 participants agreed with having longer legs strongly.},

abstract = {Kilo Hoku is a virtual reality simulation of sailing on the Hokule'a, a Polynesian double-hulled sailing canoe built in Hawai'i in 1974, which completed its worldwide voyage in 2017. By developing the simulation, we aimed to observe how a virtual reality environment could aid in the cultural preservation of the star navigation portion of Hawaiian wayfinding techniques, and to help to educate future generations of non-instrument navigators. The reaction to the simulation from current practicing Modern Hawaiian wayfinders was positive, and indicates that further study is warranted in testing the efficacy of the simulation for teaching Hawaiian wayfinding to future navigators. This paper will describe the implementation and features of the simulation.},

abstract = {New VR experiences allow users to walk extensively in the virtual space. Bigger tracking spaces, treadmills and redirected walking solutions are now available. Yet, certain connections to the user's movement are still not made. Here, we specifically see a shortcoming of representations of locomotion feedback in state-of-the-art VR setups. As shown in our paper, providing synchronized step sounds is important for involving the user further into the experience and virtual world, but is often neglected. VRsneaky detects the user's gait and plays synchronized gait-aware step sounds accordingly by attaching force sensing resistors (FSR) and accelerometers to the user's shoe. In an exciting bank robbery the user will try to rob the bank behind a guards back. The tension will increase as the user has to be aware of each step in this atmospheric experience. Each step will remind the user to pay attention to every movement, as each step will be represented using adaptive step sounds resulting in different noise levels.},

The technique adapts and extends a prior 2D kinematic template matching method to VR environments where ray pointers are used for selection. It builds on the insight that the kinematics of a controller and Head-Mounted Display (HMD) can be used to predict the ray's final landing position and angle. In our VR game, Hangry Piggos, we leverage HC-KTM to generate target predictions within a scene, and we apply pointing visualization techniques on top of them to accelerate a player's selection.},

abstract = {Head-mounted displays (HMDs) that provide a virtual reality (VR) experience using a simple configuration have been become popular. However, HMDs still have a well-known problem in that they hide the user's face when worn making it difficult for their avatars in VR space to communicate with each other because the users cannot relay their facial expressions and gaze information to their avatars. In this paper, we propose a new HMD constructed using polarizing plates that can capture the user's face and expressions while wearing it. The proposed method enables the user's face to be captured by an internal camera while blocking the scenery from the user's view using orthogonal polarizing plates. The proposed method can be implemented at low cost and can directly capture a full-color image of the user's face unlike conventional methods using infrared cameras. We implemented a prototype and confirmed that the proposed HMD captures the user's face while showing VR images. This paper discusses the unique characteristics and possible applications of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Navigation systems for runners commonly provide turn-by-turn directions via voice and/or map-based visualizations. While voice directions require permanent attention, map-based guidance requires regular consultation. Both disrupt the running activity. To provide more natural and less intrusive navigation support, we designed RunAhead, a navigation system providing head scanning based navigation feedback. According to the runner's head scanning movement and his actual head direction, we provide the runner with simple and intuitive feedback on the path s/he is looking at, highlighting the one to follow. Initially, we proposed three different feedback modes: haptic, music and audio cues. In a user experiment, RunAhead proved as effective as voice-based guidance but with a better user experience for the haptic and music feedback modes [4]. In our demonstration we will thus propose to experience these preferred feedback modes on a sample intersection.},

abstract = {We engineered a wearable microphone jammer that is capable of disabling any microphones in the user's surroundings, including hidden microphones. Our device is based on a recent exploit that leverages the fact that when exposed to ultrasonic noise, commodity microphones will leak the noise into the audible range. This allowed us to build a novel wearable microphone jammer that is worn as a bracelet on the user's wrist and jams ubiquitously. We found that our device outperforms state-of-the-art jammers. (1) Existing jammers built from multiple transducers exhibit blind spots, i.e., locations in which transducers destructively interfere and where a microphone cannot be jammed; instead, our wearable jammer leverages natural hand gestures that occur while speaking, gesturing or moving around to blur out blind spots. (2) Existing jammers are directional, requiring users to point the jammer to a microphone; instead, our wearable jams in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to even protect against microphones out of sight, such as those hidden behind everyday objects.},

abstract = {I have long been interested in how people seek information from external sources and make sense of the results. While the sources of information have continued to evolve over the years from libraries, to web search engines, to virtual assistants, many important challenges and opportunities remain. The success of any information retrieval systems depends critically on both the ability to support people in articulating their information needs and making sense of the results to solve the problem that motivated their search in the first place, as well as the need to efficiently and effectively find relevant information. My research combines these two dimensions into an interdisciplinary, user-centered perspective on information systems.My interest in information retrieval started in the early 1980's with the observation that different people use a surprisingly wide variety of words to describe the same object or concept. This fundamental characteristic of human language set limits on how well simple word-matching techniques can do in satisfying information needs. In a paper at the pre-CHI Gaithersburg conference in 1982 [6] we describe this problem as statistical semantics. (It is symptomatic of the problem that we subsequently used vocabulary mismatch, verbal disagreement, and statistical semantics to refer to the same problem.) Over the next decade, with colleagues at Bell Labs, I developed and evaluated solutions that involved collecting multiple descriptors for objects, and reducing the dimensionality of the representation using techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [3][7] to mitigate the disagreement between the vocabulary that authors use in writing and searchers use to express their information needs. Similar approaches (combined with a lot more data and compute) are used to power modern word-embedding techniques that widely used in natural language processing.},

At the operating system level, I tried to make the interface to applications more intuitive by introducing the concepts of icons and metaphor. Within applications, I tried to make the interface simpler by reducing the number of commands, making them more general ("universal"), and making their options and parameters visible with dialog boxes. I also tried to make it possible for ordinary people to program computers, since as long as people can only use predefined applications, they will be able to access only a fraction of the power of computers.These efforts have all appeared in commercial products, from the Xerox Star office computer to Stagecast Creator's educational software. These innovations have affected the personal computer industry in significant ways.},

abstract = {Our world has been animated and enriched by digital technologies used for creativity, collaboration, learning, health, politics, and commerce. Yet there is much that is troubling. We depend upon software that nobody truly understands and that is vulnerable to hackers and cyberterrorism. Privacy has been overrun by governments and surveillance capitalism. Our children are addicted to their devices; we have become workaholics. Jobs and livelihoods are being demolished without adequate social safety nets. A few digital technology leviathans threated to control not only their domains, but all commerce. Among all these issues, I am most deeply concerned about the hype associated with modern artificial intelligence, and the risks to society stemming from premature use of AI software. We are particularly vulnerable in domains such as medical diagnosis, criminal justice, seniors care, driving, and warfare. Here AI applications have begun or are imminent. Yet much current AIs are unreliable and inconsistent, without common sense; deceptive in hiding that they are algorithms and not people; mute and unable to explain decisions and actions; unfair and unjust; free from accountability and responsibility; and used but not trusted. Happily, we are not helpless victims of forces totally outside our control. We can raise our voices as citizens; we can enact procedures and legislation as a society. My talk will mention steps of both kinds, then focus on what we as digital technology, HCI, and usability professionals can and must do.},

abstract = {Some years ago, I began to read environmental philosophy such as deep ecology and Marxist interpretations. At the time I did not know what to do with this material, but my tree hugging instincts and experience of having seen my rural grandparents live a decent but very simple life inspired an abiding interest in the topics these philosophers were writing about. My grandparents grew a lot of their own food, kept an ancient car that my grandfather maintained, and enjoyed strong social ties with family and friends. It seems now that we must develop our own forms of simplicity and self-reliance if we are to weather the devastations the market economy is visiting on the planet. When I discovered computing colleagues worried about the same environmental issues I was, we collaborated to create the Computing within LIMITS community.LIMITS is a series of workshops focused on how to use computing tools and strategies to address global environmental problems. Inspired by the classic 1972 Limits to Growth report (itself a product of computing), the premise is that we must accept and embrace the reality that we live on a finite planet. That reality must inform and animate our work. The first LIMITS Workshop was held in 2015, with one each year since. The Sixth Annual Workshop is in June.Most computing research does not address or take into account the finiteness of Earth. In 2018, I first authored a paper with LIMITS colleagues for Communications of the ACM to discuss this matter. I was skeptical of acceptance, but perhaps it is a sign of the times that reviewers were surprisingly positive. The paper argues that problems of sustainability are socioeconomic in origin, and we can turn to the field of ecological economics to set a course. In a subsequent paper, "Design in the Age of Climate Change," I examined social movements that consider sustainability within an economic frame, such as the post-growth movement in Europe, the Transition Town movement, and food sovereignty movements worldwide. These movements draw from earlier ideas such as Gandhi's notion of abundance within simplicity.},

abstract = {Many technologies available to autistic children functionally focus on the medical characteristics of a diagnosis of autism. All too often, these technologies are not oriented towards their specific modes of sense-making, but rather towards an outcome behaviour defined by a neurotypically dominant society [7]. These technologies are then also evaluated according to the extrinsic motivations driving their design. Recently, though, more and more Participatory Design (PD) projects create technologies together with autistic children, albeit still mostly remaining in a medicalised view of autism. Hence, there is a lack of research into participatory design with autistic children aiming to develop technologies that reflect their intrinsic interests, holistic wellbeing and considers the embodied experiences they have with these technologies.Constructive notions of experience in the research field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) rely on empathy as a core component of experience-driven evaluations [2]. However, autistic individuals perceive the world differently and, hence, make sense of it differently than non-autistic researchers [1]. This divide becomes especially pronounced when working with children, whose life worlds vastly differ from those of adult researchers. While empathy is a core requirement for the evaluation of the experience of autistic children, my work shows that researchers cannot rely solely on their empathy. Hence, evaluating these experiences requires a structured process capturing multiple views [6].},

abstract = {When interacting with materials, we infer many of their properties through tactile stimuli. These stimuli are caused by our manual interaction with the material, they are therefore closely coupled to our actions. Similarly, if we are subjected to a vibrotactile stimulus with a frequency directly coupled to our actions, we do not experience vibration - instead we experience this as a material property. My thesis explores this phenomenon of 'material experience' in three parts. Part I contributes two novel devices, a flexible phone which provides haptic feedback as it is being deformed, and a system which can track a finger and simultaniously provide haptic feedback. Part II investigates how vibration is perceived, when coupled to motion: what are the effects of varying feedback parameters and what are the effects of different types of motion? Part III reflects and contextualizes the findings presented in the previous sections. In this extended abstract I briefly outline the most important aspects of my thesis and questions I've left unanswered, while also reflecting on the writing process.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligent (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are coming out of research labs into the real-world applications, and recent research has focused a lot on Human-AI Interaction (HAI) and Explainable AI (XAI). However, Interaction is not the same as Collaboration. Collaboration involves mutual goal understanding, preemptive task co-management and shared progress tracking. Most of human activities today are done collaboratively, thus, to integrate AI into the already-complicated human workflow, it is critical to bring the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) perspective into the root of the algorithmic research and plan for a Human-AI Collaboration future of work. In this panel we ask: Can this future for trusted human-AI collaboration be realized? If so, what will it take? This panel will bring together HCI experts who work on human collaboration and AI applications in various application contexts, from industry and academia and from both the U.S. and China. Panelists will engage the audience through discussion of their shared and diverging visions, and through suggestions for opportunities and challenges for the future of human-AI collaboration.},

abstract = {A large portion of the software side of the global information technology infrastructure, including web search, email, social media, and much more, is in many cases provided free to the end users. At the same time, the corporations that provide these services are often enormously profitable. The business model that enables this involves customized advertising and sometimes behavior manipulation, powered by intensive gathering and cross-correlation of detailed personal information. These companies provide some great products and services at no upfront cost to the end users. But the model has a dark side as well, with negative impacts for privacy, autonomy, human dignity, and democracy. The purpose of this panel is to provide a civil forum for the CHI community as a whole to discuss this business model, including its advantages and disadvantages, and its impacts on CHI and HCI and society more generally, with an eye toward responsible innovation.},

In our study, participants navigated through a VE using the WIP method while inhabiting an avatar. We varied the leg motions of the avatar while performing the WIP gesture: (1) Fixed Body the legs stood still; (2) Prerecorded Animation the legs moved in a fixed predetermined pace (plausible but not in accordance to that of the user in general); (3) Synchronized Motion the legs moved according (synchronized) to the those of the users. Our results indicate that the sense of presence improved significantly by visualizing the leg movement, synchronized or not. This in turn further enhanced the sense of body ownership especially when the leg motion was synchronized to that of the user (Synchronized Motion). However, a significant level of simulation sickness was reported when the virtual leg motion did not match the user's (Fixed Body and Prerecorded Animation). We discuss the implications for representing the avatar locomotion in immersive virtual environments.},

In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying spatial scale perception (SSP), the perception of risks, and the ability to detect them in the virtual environment. We conducted a user study where participants experienced four unique perspectives, that of a two-year-old child, an eight-year-old child, an adult and a person in a wheelchair by manipulating their virtual inter-pupillary distance and eye height. We found that varying SSP had significant impacts on the perceived level of risk, heights of the identified risk, and the number of risks discovered. The results yielded empirical evidence to support that experiencing different SSP, can potentially help identify issues during an architectural design process for various groups of users.},

We developed a prototype using seven everyday objects and evaluated ARphy through a qualitative user study. Our findings indicate that ARphy is intuitive, immersive, and enjoyable and has the potential for selectively managing collections using photos and objects that have personal meanings.},

On the other hand, a more holistic understanding of when and why users would like devices and features to be smart is missing as of today. Such knowledge is valuable for researchers and practitioners to inform the design of future smart home devices and features, in particular with regards to interaction techniques, privacy mechanisms, and, ultimately, acceptance and uptake. We found that users would appreciate smart features for various use cases, including remote control and multi-tasking, and are willing to share devices. We believe our work to be useful for designers and HCI researchers by supporting the design and evaluation of future smart devices.},

Latest technological advances enable portable mixed reality experiences on smartphones. In this work, we propose a portable low-fidelity solution for text input in mixed reality on a physical keyboard that employs accessible off-the-shelf components. Through a user study with 24 participants, we show that our prototype leads to a significantly higher text input performance compared to soft keyboards. However, it falls behind on copy editing compared to soft keyboards. Qualitative inquiries revealed that participants enjoyed the ample display space and perceived the accompanied privacy as beneficial. Finally, we conclude with challenges and future research that builds upon the presented findings.},

Fashion style trend analysis is an important process in fashion; however, due to a lack of quantitative style criteria, analysis results tend to vary by fashion professionals, often making it difficult to apply the analysis results to other fashion cases. In this paper, we propose an interface that provides fashion professionals with objective support which can aid in making more generalizable decisions on fashion analysis. Through interviews and interactions with fashion professionals, we identified quantitative-style classification criteria and analysis requirements in decision making. Based on such design guidelines, we introduce FashionQ (Fashion Quant), which provides three main features: A quantitative-based style clustering (FashionQStyle), style trend analysis (FashionQTrend), and style comparison analysis (FashionQMap). Professionals positively evaluated FashionQ, showing its usefulness and feasibility of fashion analysis in the future.},

abstract = {In an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) based emotion self-report collection study, engaging participants for a long period is challenging due to the repetitiveness of answering self-report probes. This often impacts the self-report collection as participants dropout in between or respond with arbitrary responses. Self-reflection (or commonly known as analyzing past activities to operate more efficiently in the future) has been effectively used to engage participants in logging physical, behavioral, or psychological data for Quantified Self (QS) studies. This motivates us to apply self-reflection to improve the emotion self-report collection procedure. We design, develop, and deploy a self-reflection interface and augment it with a smartphone keyboard-based emotion self-report collection application. The interface provides feedback to the users regarding the relation between typing behavior and self-reported emotions. We validate the proposed approach using a between-subject study, where one group (control group) is not exposed to the self-reflection interface and the other group (study group) is exposed to it. Our initial results demonstrate that using self-reflection it is possible to engage the participants in the long-term and collect more self-reports.},

These uses cases assume different user personas, will likely require different explanation strategies, and are not evenly addressed by current XAI tools. This stakeholder research supports a broad characterization of the problem of Explainable AI and can provide important context to inform the design of future capabilities.},

abstract = {Learning by teaching is an established pedagogical technique; however, the exact process through which learning happens remains difficult to assess, in part due to the variability in the tutor-tutee pairing and interaction. Prior research proposed the use of teachable agents acting as students, in order to facilitate more controlled studies of the learning by teaching phenomenon. In this work, we introduce a learning by teaching platform, Curiosity Notebook, which allows students to work individually or in groups to teach a conversational agent a classification task in a variety of subject topics. We conducted a 4-week exploratory study with 12 fourth and fifth grade elementary school children, who taught a conversational robot how to classify animals, rocks/minerals and paintings. This paper outlines the architecture of our system, describes the lessons learned from the study, and contributes design considerations on how to design conversational agents and applications for learning by teaching scenarios.},

However, a specific situation may require hands-on experience that cannot be easily conveyed through a textbook or a video, such as caring for a schizophrenic patient. Simulation has been considered as an effective method to replace observation-based clinical placement to overcome safety issues. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of employing a virtual reality (VR) learning platform for nursing students to learn how to care for schizophrenic patients. Using 360-degree video and a head-mounted display (HMD), students experienced virtual patients who have schizophrenia portrayed by professional actors. Our key contribution is in the insights about the design of educational VR applications, highlighting the potential value of VR for training students with non-technical backgrounds.},

abstract = {Despite being accessible and affordable, online education presents numerous challenges for online learners due to the absence of face-to-face interactions. Lack of community-belongingness, in particular, negatively impacts online learners' learning outcomes and learning experience. To help online learners build communities and foster connections with their peers, we designed and deployed Jill Watson SA (stands for Social Agent). Jill Watson SA is a virtual agent who can match students with shared identity, defined by similarities in location, timezone, hobby, class schedule, etc., on the Piazza class discussion forum. We implemented Jill Watson SA in two online classes and conducted three short surveys with online students to evaluate Jill Watson SA.},

abstract = {Emotion regulation (ER) is foundational to mental health and well-being. In the last ten years, there has been an increasing focus on this use of interactive technologies to support ER training in a variety of contexts. However, work has been done by researchers from diverse fields, and no cohesive research agenda exists that explicates how and why interactive technologies may benefit ER training. To address this gap, this paper presents the initial results of a descriptive review of 38 peer-reviewed papers on this topic. Qualitative analysis revealed four opportunity themes where interactive technologies appear to provide unique benefits. The analysis also revealed three challenge themes where design guidance, particularly around emotion representation, is ambiguous or underspecified. Based on our findings, we propose future research in these thematic areas; we also propose intersectional themes and underexplored areas that researchers and designers may find productive to explore.},

However, the educational benefits of television have long been limited by children not being able to interact with the content in a contingent way. This project leverages an intelligent conversational agent -an on-screen character capable of verbal interaction-to add social contingency into children's experience watching science videos. This conversational agent has been developed in an iterative process and embedded in a new PBS KIDS science show "Elinor Wonders Why." This Late Breaking Work presents the design of the conversational agent and reports findings from a field study that has proven feasibility of this approach. We also discuss our planned future work to examine the agent's effectiveness in enhancing children's engagement and learning.},

We thus suggest that, by envisioning high-level API affordances as scaffolds, API designers can not only enhance users' productivity, but they can also help drive adoption of software components attempting to radically innovate on their past inheritance. We propose scaffold design recommendations that can augment existing API usability frameworks.},

However, there is still a lack of quantitative research for evaluating the influence of the flow state on learning outcomes. One of the issues related to flow experience identification is that used techniques are often invasive or not suitable for massive applications. The current paper suggests a way to deal with this challenge. We describe a methodology based on multimodal learning analytics, aimed to provide automatic students' flow experience identification in the gamified assignments and measuring its influence on the learning outcomes. The application of the developed methodology showed that there are correlations between learning outcomes and flow state, but they depend on the initial level of the user. This finding suggests adding dynamic difficulty adjustment and other flow experience dimension to the gamified assignment.},

abstract = {Collaborative coding offers many benefits to students, but there has been little research on evaluating the applications that students use to collaborate on code. In this preliminary work, we ask "are students' needs being met by existing applications for collaborative coding"? A survey was distributed to students and faculty of computer science to determine if students had experience collaborating on programming projects and identify what applications, if any, they used to facilitate their collaborations. Survey respondents were also asked about the strengths and weaknesses of the applications they used. From the 126 student responses and 23 faculty responses representing 31 unique institutions, over 50 applications were mentioned. We manually clustered the applications based on their affordances and used participant responses to identify opportunities for improvement. We found that many students are retrofitting non-coding applications for their programming projects as a workaround to facing the large learning curves that many collaborative coding tools require. Our findings suggest a need for more novice-friendly collaborative tools.},

Using the tool, children can imagine and code their own expressive, playful, and personally meaningful probabilistic projects, such as-generative art, music, or text; chance-based games and stories; interactive visualizations; and even advanced projects for making a computer learn from input data using simple Markov models of probabilistic learning, among many other creative possibilities.},

While there are continuous glucose monitors available, they are expensive and not available for many patients. Related work suggests a correlation between the blood glucose level and physiological measures, such as heart rate variability. We therefore propose a machine learning model to detect hypoglycemia on basis of data from smartwatch sensors gathered in a proof-of-concept study. In further work, we want to integrate our model in wearables and warn individuals with diabetes of possible hypoglycemia. However, presenting just the detection output alone might be confusing to a patient especially if it is a false positive result. We thus use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for feature attribution and a method for subsequently explaining the model decision in a comprehensible way on smartwatches.},

abstract = {Time and its lack of play a central role in our everyday lives. Despite increasing productivity, many people experience "time stress" exhaustion and longing for time affluence, and at the same time, a fear of not being busy enough. All this leads to a neglect of natural time, especially the patterns and rhythms created by physiological processes, subsumed under the heading of chronobiology. The present paper presents and evaluates a calendar application, which uses chronobiological knowledge to support people's planning activities. Participants found our calendar to be interesting and engaging. It especially made them think more about their bodies and appropriate times for particular activities. All in all, it supported participants in negotiating external demands and personal health and wellbeing. This shows that technology does not necessarily has to be neutral or even further current (mal-)practices. Our calendar cares about changing perspectives and thus about enhancing users' wellbeing.},

In the treatment blocks, children's utterances were evaluated either by caregivers or an automated pronunciation framework. Preliminary analysis suggests that children made significant therapy gains with Apraxia World, even though caregivers evaluated pronunciation leniently. We also collected a corpus of child speech for offline examination. We will conduct additional analysis once all participants complete the protocol.},

Current tools for the development of dialog systems are primarily focused on writing intent-slot schemas for natural language understanding and finite-state models of dialog management. However, this is a time-consuming process that can be opaque for clinical teams and the limitations of both approaches are well understood. The health domain presents additional barriers including access to patients and concerns about exposing personal health information. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, it describes an interface designed to augment the ability of clinicians to efficiently engage in high-quality and empathetic health counseling dialog with their patients. Second, it presents a WOZ protocol for collecting this dialog using standardized patient actors each playing a role from a pool of caregiver personas.},

abstract = {Mental health conditions pose a major challenge to healthcare providers and society at large. Early intervention can have significant positive impact on a person's prognosis, particularly important in improving mental health outcomes and functioning for young people. Virtual Reality (VR) in mental health is an emerging and innovative field. Recent studies support the use of VR technology in the treatment of anxiety, phobia, eating disorders, addiction, and pain management. However, there is little research on using VR for supporting, treatment and prevention of depression - a field that is very much emerging. There is also very little work done in offering individualised VR experience to users with mental health issues. This paper proposes iVR, a novel individualised VR for improving users' self-compassion, and in the long run, their positive mental health. We describe the concept, design, architecture and implementation of iVR and outline future work. We believe this contribution will pave the way for large-scale efficacy testing, clinical use, and potentially cost-effective delivery of VR technology for mental health therapy in future.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in including clinicians as builders of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) AT. To identify the needs of clinicians-as-makers, we investigated the challenges that clinicians faced as they volunteered in an AT building project where they were the primary designers and builders of assistive mobility devices for children. Through observation and co-building of modified ride-on toy cars with clinicians, we found that the rapid pace of development and transient relationship between user and builder did not allow for a complete assessment of the child's mobility. Furthermore, clinicians struggled to actualize concepts borne out of their clinical intent due to a lack of engineering skill. This study highlights the need for tools that support clinicians-as-makers in the AT maker process and a new conceptualization of the role of DIY-AT maker programs within the AT provider ecosystem.},

Our findings show that participants who were less interested in trying new diets were more willing to reduce calories when presented with a comparison to people unlike them, an out-group member comparison, while those who were interested in trying new diets were more willing to reduce calories regardless of social comparison type. These findings imply that one size does not fit all when nudging. More research is needed to see how social comparisons influence the effectiveness of digital health behavior projects.},

abstract = {Humanoid robots through their embodied features and range of interactivity are proving to be effective as service or information disseminating agents. However in the Australian context, the deployment and evaluation of robots in public spaces is limited. In this study, we report on an observation based exploratory study of university students interaction with the Pepper humanoid robot over 8 days in the library of an Australian university. The students' first impressions of Pepper using the top-of-mind association showed that they were in general wary and scared of service robots. Many considered Pepper as creepy. Their positive remarks were related to the novelty of Pepper's features and technology. In conclusion, we speculate on the results obtained and what they mean for the integration of humanoid robots in mainstream Australian society.},

Such a concept has captivated city authorities worldwide, and motivated plenty of works to investigate how to make our cities more "creative". We argue that there is a need and an opportunity to design interactive technologies to push the creative city agenda. In this paper, we present WeMonet, a design prototype supporting citizens engaging in participatory street art creation via human-AI collaboration. Citizens' sketches are synthesized, enhanced to be more vivid through machine machine learning algorithms, and projected on a screen, forming a participatory artwork. WeMonet aims to promote citizens' engagement in creative practices and hence the city's creativity. More broadly speaking, we hope this work could inspire designers to consider the role of interaction design in the creative city agenda.},

Digital technologies are often seen, not without merit, as reflecting and embodying cultural values that are at odds with indigenous ways of learning. To overcome this we organised a 'Coding on Country' workshop. The workshop took place outdoors, at a culturally significant location, was embedded within cultural practices, as well as other mundane activities, and drew participation from young people as well as from Elders. Key insights are that activities that take place on country are also intrinsically about country and culture. A site of cultural significance can, better than a classroom, draw together younger and older community members, and offer a social centre which people can gravitate around while engaging in different activities. This contributes to reconciling technology and tradition, and offers opportunities to participate on one's own terms.},

This hinders the non-linear nature of the creative process where seeing a trail of process work can spark new ideas.

With the availability of devices to mass market, new applications become possible, and new research problems open up.

Researchers have leveraged novel structure design and material techniques to create a wide range of 4D shapes. Meanwhile, 4D printing texture (i.e., shape-changing texture) on objects which could easily augment the haptic sensation, has drawn more attention to this field. In this paper, we introduce 4DTexture, a novel design and fabrication approach that integrates texture design through the 4D printing process. Compared to conventional 3D printing surfaces with texture, which usually requires support structures, 4DTexture can effectively reduce production material, time and the post-process effort after printing. Specifically, 4DTexture prints flat substrates with a customized texture design on its top surfaces, which can easily be triggered and can self-morph to target 3D shapes. Overall, our approach enables the design and fabrication of 3D surfaces with texture and can be leveraged by designers and researchers in the field of personal fabrication.},

The analysis of the unique seahorse's tail structure became the insight into the overall biomimetic design. In fact, a seahorse tail enables movement, gripping and protection to the seahorse while floating. SpaceHuman is an additive prosthetic that can move around the body to grasp objects and handles in microgravity, protecting the wearer from injuries that might occur while floating in a confined habitat, while providing an adaptable and kinematically stable base.

abstract = {In recent years, in-mold electronics (IME) technique was introduced as a combination of printing electrically functional materials and vacuum plastic forming. IME has gained significant attention across various industries since it enables various electrical functionalities on a wide range of 3D geometries. Although IME shows great application potentials, hardships still exist during design for the manufacturing stage. For example, printed 2D structures experience mechanical bending and stretching during vacuum forming. This results in challenges for designers to ensure precise circuit-to-3D mold registration or to prevent over deformation of circuit and attached components. To this end, we propose a software toolkit that provides real time 2D-to-3D mapping, guided structural and electrical circuit design with interactive user interface. We present a novel software-guided IME process that leads to fully functional 3D electronic structures with printed conductive traces and assembled surface-mount components.},

abstract = {When new things, such as buildings or physical products, are designed, the design process typically explores multiple design alternatives and undergoes several iterations. The associated artefacts typically grow from low-fidelity prototypes, such as paper sketches, to high-fidelity prototypes, such as 3D scale models. While previous work has focused on capturing the design rationale behind the decisions that happen during such a design process, this information typically remains secluded and is not easily accessible for the stakeholders. In this paper, we explore how to augment both physical and digital designs with their associated design rationale and decisions. Our exploratory inquiry with three experts in architecture provides qualitative feedback on our augmented reality tool and concepts. We expect that these preliminary results are valuable for future traceability tools for physical and digital designs, even beyond the domain of architecture.},

Three variables were measured, the number of control checks during AD and non-driving related tasks (NDRT), the reaction time to resume manual control and the strategy used to recover control. Differences were found concerning road monitoring during NDRT, there are more interruptions in the WOz condition than in the DS condition. Additionally, the strategies used to recover control were different between conditions, the steering wheel and brake pedal were used more often in the WOz condition while the accelerator was used more often in the DS condition. However, no difference was found concerning reaction time to resume control.},

abstract = {Many non-expert Machine Learning users wish to apply powerful deep learning models to their own domains but encounter hurdles in the opaque model tuning process. We introduce SCRAM, a tool which uses heuristics to detect potential error conditions in model output and suggests actionable steps and best practices to help such users tune their models. Inspired by metaphors from software engineering, SCRAM extends high-level deep learning development tools to interpret model metrics during training and produce human-readable error messages. We validate SCRAM through three author-created example scenarios with image and text datasets, and by collecting informal feedback from ML researchers with teaching experience. We finally reflect upon our feedback for the design of future ML debugging tools.},

abstract = {Manuscript speech is a common type of speech in various official events. However, we often observe that many speakers simply read the script without making eye contact, thereby lowering audience engagement. Practice with proper tools could benefit a speaker considerably. In this work, we iteratively designed ScriptFree, an adaptive speech practice environment where off-the-shelf automatic speech recognition (ASR) is leveraged to measure a speaker's preparation level, and accordingly, the script is adaptively compressed to reduce the speaker's visual reliance toward script mastery. The user study results confirmed that ScriptFree helped the participants to success- fully improve their speech over multiple practice iterations. The results have significant design implications for building adaptive speech practice systems.},

abstract = {In general, a system with touch input waits for a certain period of time (typically 350 -- 500 ms) for a subsequent tap to determine whether the initial tap was a single tap or the first tap of a double tap. This results in latency of hundreds of milliseconds for a single-tap event. To reduce the latency, we propose a novel machine-learning-based tap recognition method called "PredicTaps". In the PredicTaps method, by using touch-event data gathered from the capacitive touch surface, the system immediately predicts whether a detected tap is a single tap or the first tap of a double tap. Then, in accordance with the prediction, the system determines whether to execute a single-tap event immediately or wait for a subsequent second tap. This paper reports the feasibility study of PredicTaps.},

Though the instruction of the golf-swing has been conducted to the beginners by the instructor or the consumer device specialized in the golf-swing training, it was difficult to modify the posture of golf-club during the swing. This is because the users require time to understand and express the instruction. Also, these instructions cannot convey detailed information to the users. Therefore, we propose a golf club type device mounting ungrounded force feedback module to modify the posture of golf-club during the golf-swing. In this paper, we implemented a prototype of the proposed device and the application using the device. The prototype was evaluated its performance and the results suggested the prototype generate sufficient torque to move the golf-club grasped by the user.},

However, human hands can ergonomically move in a broader range than a smartphone's field of view (FOV) can capture, requiring users to be aware of the limited usable interaction and viewing regions at all times. We present Portalware, a smartphone-wearable dual-display system that expands the usable interaction region for free-hand manipulation and enables users to receive visual feedback outside the smartphone's view. The wearable is a lightweight, low-cost display that shares the same AR environment in real-time with the smartphone.This setup empowers AR applications such as mid-air drawing and object manipulation by providing a 180-degree horizontal interaction region in front of the user. Other potential applications include wearing the smartphone like a pendant while using Portalware to continue interacting with AR objects. Without having to hold their phone up with their hand, users can benefit from resting their arms as needed. Finally, we discuss usability explorations, potential interactions, and future plans for empirical studies.},

This paper proposes a system that can change the center of mass by switching the weight to different positions around the head of a putter. The proposed system starts switching the weight at the beginning of a downswing and ends before the putter hits a ball. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a user study and examined if the face to path angle of the putter changed when the weight was switched to different positions. In the user study, the participant performed putting with different switching angles. In the analysis, we focused on the differences in the face to path angle among the switching angles. The user study showed that the proposed system is effective in changing the face to path angle when switching the weight away from the putter's shaft. Based on the experimental results, the proposed system contributes to affecting the face to path angle dynamically in real-time.},

XAI is increasingly important in bringing transparency to fields such as medicine and criminal justice where AI informs high consequence decisions. While many XAI techniques have been proposed, few have been evaluated beyond anecdotal evidence. Our research offers a novel approach to assess how humans interpret AI explanations; we explore this by integrating XAI with Games with a Purpose (GWAP). XAI requires human evaluation at scale, and GWAP can be used for XAI tasks which are presented through rounds of play. This paper outlines the benefits of GWAP for XAI, and demonstrates application through our creation of a multi-player GWAP that focuses on explaining deep learning models trained for image recognition. Through our game, we seek to understand how humans select and interpret explanations used in image recognition systems, and bring empirical evidence on the validity of GWAP designs for XAI.},

This paper presents our initial exploration into the space of player death and rebirth through the creation of a generalized taxonomy developed from 62 recent platformer games. Our taxonomy consists of five key dimensions: 1) obstacles, 2) death conditions, 3) aesthetics, 4) changes to player progress, and 5) respawn locations.},

One way to motivate people eating healthy is using gamification, i.e. using game elements in a non-game context. Often, a static set of gamification elements is used. However, research suggests that the motivational impact of gamification elements differs substantially across users, demanding personalized approaches. In this paper, we contribute to this by investigating the perception of frequently used gamification elements in the healthy eating domain and correlations to Hexad user types in an online study (N=237). To do so, we created storyboards illustrating these gamification elements and show their comprehensibility in a lab study (N=8). Our results validate and extend previous research in the healthy eating domain, underline the need for personalization and could be used to inform the design of gamified systems for healthy eating.},

abstract = {To provide universal accessibility, public community spaces such as museums must be designed considering the experience of all patrons, including visitors living with Autism Spectrum Disorder. To develop a better understanding of the experience of visitors with autism at the Canada Science and Technology Museum, we invited four school children and one adult male for a visit, all of whom identified as being on the spectrum. They were joined by their support persons. We interviewed the adult, his caregiver and the teaching staff accompanying the school children. We analyzed our interviews and observation notes using thematic analysis to formulate key findings and suggestions to enhance the experience for autistic people. They include adding elements at a variety of developmental levels, offering options to reduce sensory stimulation, improving navigational resources and providing more resources for support persons.},

abstract = {Computing impacts almost every aspect of modern life. In this current wave of computing, designers strive for ubiquitous use across contexts, across platforms, and across users. Yet, there is still much to be explored in the area of accessible technologies for collaborative work. Assistive technologies are often designed for single use or single users. Interoperability between assistive technologies and computer-supported collaborative systems is essential to co-located work that inherently involves interdependencies between coworkers. The interoperability of collaborative workplace systems with assistive technologies for deaf-blind users is limited to screen readers used with refreshable braille displays [3]. How can a deaf-blind person collaborate with coworkers in real time? In this work, we explore socio-technical challenges of a work environment that depends on collaborative and assistive technologies. We observed an Information Systems and Technology (IS&amp;T) department at a University that is made up of 65 employees-one of whom is a deaf-blind programmer analyst. Through Contextual Inquiry, our observations revealed communication tensions. We present 3 Wizard of Oz prototypes to facilitate communication between the assistive technology user and the other employees in the department. We discuss the socio-technical features weaved through the prototypes. Future work is discussed.},

abstract = {Visual attention guides the integration of two streams: the global, that rapidly processes the scene; and the local, that processes details. For people with autism, the integration of these two streams can be disrupted by the tendency to privilege details (local processing) instead of seeing the big picture (global processing). Consequently, people with autism may struggle with typical visual attention, evidenced by their verbal description of local features when asked to describe overall scenes. This paper aims to explore how one adult with autism see and understand the global filter of natural scenes.},

abstract = {Blind people face various local navigation challenges in their daily lives such as identifying empty seats in crowded stations, navigating toward a seat, and stopping and sitting at the correct spot. Although voice navigation is a commonly used solution, it requires users to carefully follow frequent navigational sounds over short distances. Therefore, we presented an assistive robot, BlindPilot, which guides blind users to landmark objects using an intuitive handle. BlindPilot employs an RGB-D camera to detect the positions of target objects and uses LiDAR to build a 2D map of the surrounding area. On the basis of the sensing results, BlindPilot then generates a path to the object and guides the user safely. To evaluate our system, we also implemented a sound-based navigation system as a baseline system, and asked six blind participants to approach an empty chair using the two systems. We observed that BlindPilot enabled users to approach a chair faster with a greater feeling of security and less effort compared to the baseline system.},

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel photo-taking system named VisPhoto.

That is, when the shutter button is pressed, the proposed system captures an omni-directional camera image. In the post-production, from the objects detected in the image, the user selects the ones that should be included and excluded. Finally, as a "photo," the system outputs a cropped region satisfying the user's preference and looking beautiful from an aesthetic point of view.},

The result of focus interviews showed that visually impaired people could significantly distinguish and recognize the variation of color by grating textures. The study of color perception from grating texture indicates tactile efficiency of color recognition as a method for appreciating art painting.

However, it can be overwhelming to quickly iterate on the conversation design as the iterative process requires not only designing a conversation but also building and testing a working chatbot equipped with the conversation. We developed ProtoChat, a prototype system that supports an iterative conversation design by allowing designers to (1) prototype conversations, (2) test the conversations with the crowd, and (3) review and analyze the crowdsourced conversation data. Results of an exploratory study with four conversation designers show that the designers successfully iterated on their conversation design by reviewing how the crowd followed the conversation, which provided insights into concrete action items for improving their conversation design.},

abstract = {Care in communities has a powerful influence on potentially disruptive social encounters. Practising care in moderation means exposing a group's core values, which, in turn, has the potential to strengthen identity and relationships in communities. Dissent is as inevitable in online communities as it is in their offline counterparts. However, dissent can be productive by sparking discussions that drive the evolution of community norms and boundaries, and there is value in understanding the role of moderation in this process. Our work draws on an exploratory analysis of moderation practices in the MetaFilter community, focusing on cases of intervention and response. We identify and analyse MetaFilter moderation with the metaphor: "taking care of a fruit tree", which is quoted from an interview with moderators on MetaFilter. We address the relevance of care as it is evidenced in these MetaFilter exchanges, and discuss what it might mean to approach an analysis of online moderation practices with a focus on nurturing care. We consider how HCI researchers might make use of care-as-nurture as a frame to identify multi-faceted and nuanced concepts characterising dissent and to develop tools for the sustainable support of online communities and their moderators.},

abstract = {Ray casting is frequently used to point and select distant targets in Virtual Reality (VR) systems. In this work, we evaluate user performance in 3D pointing with two different ray casting versions: infinite ray casting, where the cursor is positioned on the surface of the first object along the ray that said ray points at, and finite ray-casting, where the cursor is attached to the ray at a fixed distance from the controller. Twelve subjects performed a Fitts' law experiment where the targets were placed 1, 2, or 3 meters away from the user. According to the results, subjects were faster and made fewer errors with the infinite ray length. Interestingly, their (effective) pointing throughput was higher when the ray length was constrained. We illustrate the advantages of both methods in immersive VR applications and provide information for practitioners and developers to choose the most appropriate ray-casting-based selection method for VR.},

In our previous study, we implemented an electrolysis bubble display using drinkable beverages. Although clear clusters of bubbles could be created in short times, they did not disappear for a long time; consequently, the refresh time period of the display was considerably long. To overcome this deficiency, we present UTAKATA, a ticker-like bubble display using a running-water channel. To establish this display, a linear array of seven electrodes is fabricated on the bottom of a water channel. By activating the appropriate electrodes among the seven ones, circular bubble clusters are generated above the electrodes and then imposed to float downstream using a water flow. This allows representing an N \texttimes{} 7 dot-matrix display to have a shorter refresh time compared with our previous method, and expanding the range of expressions of ephemeral user interfaces using bubbles.},

abstract = {Enhancing a user's sense of presence and immersion with haptic technologies has recently been getting increasing attention in virtual reality (VR). Yet while several devices that use wind as a haptic modality have been proposed, it is difficult to precisely and quickly control the stimulation of the wind. In this study, we tackle creating an illusion of wind blowing with multiple air cannons that provides clear and low-latency tactile sensations in a specific area. Although air cannons are limited to providing short one-time stimuli, we propose a method for creating a sense of wind blowing with air cannons based on the perception of apparent tactile motion (ATM). We conducted an experiment with 12 participants to investigate the occurrence of the wind blowing sensation and the optimal parameters for it using three air cannons that were placed to hit three parts on the face. Finally, based on the results, we have exhibited a demonstration of the wind-blowing illusion with three air cannons. It created a sense that virtual objects passed in front of the participants by synchronizing with the sound source movement.},

Multi-view and multi-modal learning have been considered useful for various complex tasks; however, an in-depth analysis or a large-scale dataset on multi-view, multi-modal gaze estimation under a long-distance setup with a low illumination is still very limited. To address these limitations, first, we construct a dataset of images captured under challenging conditions. And we propose a simple deep learning architecture that can handle multi-view multi-modal data for gaze estimation. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation of the proposed network with the constructed dataset to understand the effects of multiple views of a user and multi-modality (RGB, depth, and infrared). We report various findings from our preliminary experimental results and expect this would be helpful for gaze estimation studies to deal with challenging conditions.},

Our system enables designers to sketch 3D curves that can be freely posed and easily viewed from different directions; it makes sketching chained moving parts and propagating changes to different poses and perspectives effortless. We show that, with interactions closely resembling traditional 2D perspective sketching and the physical manipulation of an articulated object, designers can focus solely on ideating, iterating, and communicating multi-pose product concepts during the initial stage of design.},

Data from multiple sensors and users is aggregated at various scales to produce new, fine-grained inferences about people. Users of these systems are asked to consent to sharing their data without full knowledge of what data are recorded, how the data are used, who has access to the data, and most importantly risks associated with sharing. Recent work has shown that provoking privacy speculation among system users, by visualizing these various aspects, improves user knowledge and enables them to make informed decisions about their data. This paper presents a conceptual model of how researchers can make inferences that provoke privacy speculation among system users and a case study applying the model.},

abstract = {Traditional measuring devices separate probes from their data visualisation, requiring the operator to switch attention between their metering and result frequently. We explored the efficiency of four different visualisation modalities during a circuit analysis task that utilises the output of an oscilloscope. We argue that the spatial alignment of an oscilloscope's display and probe interferes with the cognitive processing of data visualisations, hence increasing the probability of errors and required time. We compared a fixed placed oscilloscope, in-situ projections, user positioned tablets, and head-mounted display while measuring completion times, subjective workload, number of errors, and personal preferences after each task. Results indicate that the oscilloscope produced the lowest completion time compared to other modalities. However, visualising data on a user positioned tablet or through in-situ projections yielded lower subjective workload and a lower number of errors. We discuss how our work generalises for assistive systems that support practitioners during their training in circuit analysis.},

abstract = {Exploiting the potential of automated vehicles and future traffic concepts like platooning or dynamic intersections requires the integration of human traffic participants. Recent research investigating how automated vehicles can communicate with other road users has focused mainly on pedestrians. We argue that cyclists are another important group of vulnerable road users that must be considered, as cycling is a vital transportation modality for a more sustainable future. Within this paper, we discuss the needs of cyclists and claim that their integration will demand to think of other concepts, which support moving communication partners. We further sketch potential approaches for augmented reality applications based on related work and present results of a pilot study aiming to evaluate and improve those. Initial findings show that people are open towards concepts that increase cyclist safety. However, it is key to present information clearly and unambiguously to produce a benefit.},

abstract = {As digital fabrication tools become commonplace and widely used for prototyping, the need for simple and flexible solutions to make prototypes interactive is increasing. Different approaches and systems have been proposed to add functional controls to prototypes. We have developed Manypulo, a wearable system that can turn anything into a digital control, without requiring integration of electronics or programming. It is a highly flexible approach based on RFID and accelerometers, which aims to facilitate and speed up the creation of functional prototypes. Hand movements are captured and then translated into digital input by a Bluetooth-connected app.},

abstract = {Smartwatches can be used independently from smartphones, but input tasks like messaging are cumbersome due to the small display size. Parts of the display are hidden during interaction, which can lead to incorrect input. For simplicity, instead of general text input a small set of answer options are often provided, but these are limited and impersonal. In contrast, free-form drawings can answer messages in a very personal way, but are difficult to produce on small displays. To enable precise drawing input on smartwatches we present a magnetic stylus that is tracked on the back of the hand. In an evaluation of several algorithms we show that 3D position estimation with a 7.5x20mm magnet reaches a worst-case 6% relative position error on the back of the hand. Furthermore, the results of a user study are presented, which show that in the case of drawing applications the presented technique is faster and more precise than direct finger input.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the Smart Hard Hat; an interactive hard hat that aims to protect the hearing health of construction workers by utilising shape shifting technology. The device responds to loud noises by automatically closing earmuffs around the wearer's ears, warning them of the damage that is being caused while taking away the need to consciously protect yourself. Construction workers are particularly vulnerable to noise-induced hearing loss, so this was the target user for this design. Initial testing revealed that the Smart Hard Hat effectively blocks out noise, that there is a possibility to expand the design to new user groups, and that there is potential in using shape-changing technologies to protect personal health.},

Our results show that people both sorted more effectively and perceived themselves more effective. Furthermore, we document a trend where people sorting without suggestions perceived themselves more effective than they were, while the opposite was true for people when sorting receiving suggestions.

abstract = {This study describes the production of a novel taste display which uses ion electrophoresis in five gels containing electrolytes that supply controlled amounts of each of the five basic tastes to apply an arbitrary taste to the user's tongue, analogous to optical displays that produce arbitrary colors from lights of three basic colors. When applied to the tongue with no voltage, the user can taste all five tastes. However, when an electric potential is applied, the cations in the gel move to the cathode side and away from the tongue, so that the flavor is tasted weakly. In this way, we have developed a taste display that reproduces an arbitrary taste by individually suppressing the sensation of each of the five basic tastes (like subtractive synthesis.) Our study differs from previous work in that it uses an electric current for electrophoresis rather than electrically stimulating the tongue, and it does not involve ingestion of a solution to deliver the taste.},

Studying users' reactions to inferences made about them, especially what surprises them, allows us to better understand this gap. We interviewed users of Google and Facebook to learn their current beliefs and expectations about how these platforms use their data to make inferences, and identified four common sources of surprise for participants: irrelevant inferences, outdated inferences, inferences with no connection to online activity, and inferences related to friends or family. We discuss the implications for designing inference-generating systems.},

While proposals have been put forth for hardening patterns, such as increasing the number of or changing the location of contact points, none of these proposals has been implemented in the decade-plus since the interface's launch. We propose a new approach; instead of increasing the individual complexity, users select two sequential Android patterns, so called Double Patterns, that are visually super imposed on one another. This allows more complexity without dramatically changing the interface. We report on our preliminary findings of a large user study (n=634) of Double Patterns, finding strong evidence that the scheme is highly usable and increases the complexity of user choice.},

While SSO is designed to make the login process more seamless and convenient, recent social media data breaches may give pause to users by raising security concerns about their online transactions. In particular, users logging into sensitive services, such as dating apps, may feel hesitant to adopt SSO due to perceived potential data leakage to their social networks. We tested this proposition through a user study (N = 364) and found that individual differences in online security perceptions predict the use of SSO for certain sensitive services (e.g., affair apps), but not others (e.g., matchmaking apps). Informed by theory, potential mediators of this relationship (perceived security, ease of sharing, and usability) were also explored, thus shedding light on psychologically salient drivers of SSO adoption.},

In this paper, we present ViTune, a visualizer tool that enhances the musical experiences of the DHH through the use of an on-screen visualizer generating effects alongside music. We observed how members of the DHH community typically experienced music through an initial user study. We then iterated on developing a visualizer prototype where we did multiple usability tests involving at least 15 participants from the DHH community. We observed how they experienced music with the help of our prototype and noticed that certain music features and elements augmented these experiences. Visualization attributes, their matching qualitative descriptions and equivalent subjective attributes were identified with the help of music experts. Also, affects hypothesized to be induced and dissuaded were identified in improving these listening experiences.},

abstract = {Spatial clustering can reduce visual clutter on maps and facilitate pattern recognition. However, interactive map exploration needs the spatial clustering to be a dynamic generation and representation process. Users may change derivative representations of clusters during the exploration process. To address this issue, we present ClusterLens, a new interaction technique that brings a focus+context approach into multi-resolution spatial clustering process. A lens is laid on a base map to avoid occlusion with the original and actual point locations. The lens can aggregate the data points at various spatial resolutions as map zoom level changes. We propose three primitives of resolution for spatial clustering: heatmap, circle, and grid, to generate and represent clusters in a separate mapping system. The lens and the base map are linked at all times. We also incorporate coordinated views into the ClusterLens system to facilitate context switching and comparison. We discuss the applicability of our technique and present a use case where ClusterLens can be useful to explore data distributions and reveal spatial patterns.},

Here we present DeepScope, a generative, lightweight and real-time HCI platform for urban planning and cityscape visualization. DeepScope is composed of a Generative Neural Network (DCGAN) and a Tangible User Interface (TUI) designed for multi-participants urban design sessions and real-time feedback.

In human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, perception biases against AI, machines, or computers are generally cited. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This paper presents a wide-scale experiment in which 565 participants are asked to evaluate paintings (which were created by humans or AI) on four dimensions: liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. A priming effect is evaluated using two between-subject conditions: Artworks presented as created by an AI, and artworks presented as created by a human artist. Finally, the paintings perceived as being drawn by human are evaluated significantly more highly than those perceived as being made by AI. Thus, using such a methodology and sample in an unprecedented way, the results show a negative bias of perception towards AI and a preference bias towards human systems.},

This work empirically studies the validity of cognitive assumptions relative to mental computation for making codes like passwords, using as a starting point password algorithms and a cost model for mental computation developed by Blum and Vempala. Through a study on 126 participants, we refute some of their model's assumptions, and introduce evidence of behaviours where human computing costs behave counter-intuitively. We also identify three empirical questions around symmetry, repeatability, and distribution of costs whose resolution would allow the development of more predictive cognitive computation models. This would then allow the efficient creation of better security algorithms.},

Enabling humans to interact with this data is a crucial and challenging step to bring the Semantic Web forward. In order to better understand how the Human-Computer Interaction community has contributed to this effort, this late-breaking work presents a review focusing on the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) venues.

Despite recent advances in figure question answering and parsing figure elements that enable machines to accurately read information from figures, the machine learning community still lacks sufficient understanding of this problem, on what contents are important to include in a caption and how to make it sound natural. In this work, we crawled, annotated, and analyzed a corpus of real-world human-written figure captions. Our study results show that real-world captions usually consist of a finite set of caption units and that automatic figure captioning should be formulated as a multi-stage task. The first stage is to generate caption units with high accuracy and the second is to stitch together the units with diverse stitching patterns, to form a natural caption.},

Current tools have predominately focused on tracking food intake, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. Other factors, such as contextual information and momentary thoughts and feelings that are internal to an individual, are also essential to help people reflect upon and change attitudes about eating behaviors. However, current dietary tracking tools rarely support capturing these elements as a way to foster deep reflection. In this work, we present Eat4Thought - a food journaling application that allows users to track their emotional, sensory, and spatio-temporal elements of meals as a means of supporting self-reflection. The application enables vivid documentation of experiences and self-reflection on the past through video recording. We describe our design process and an initial evaluation of the application.

We propose Checkpoint-and-Remind (CAR), a hybrid approach that combines participatory (PART) and context-trigger ESM labeling (ESM). Checkpoint-and-Remind has the advantage of user control but reduces users' burden in recording activities. Meanwhile, it features a context-trigger mechanism of ESM as a backup to remind users of labeling. Our preliminary evaluation of CAR with nine participants, who collected and labeled their mobility activity data for 15 weekdays, showed that compared with PART and ESM, participants collected a larger amount of annotated mobility data using CAR. In addition, participants had a higher annotation rate when using CAR than when using ESM. Our results show that the hybrid approach that combines manual and automated recording is promising. Our future work is validating these results and measure more metrics related to compliance with more participants.},

Via an online video-prototype study on a service robot with 94 Chinese participants, we find that users could tolerate up to 4s delay but their satisfaction drops at the 8s delay during both information-retrieval conversations and chitchats. We gain an in-depth understanding of users' preference for the trade-off between the voice quality and the response speed, as well as their opinions on possible robot graphic user interface (GUI) design to alleviate negative user experience with response latency.},

A big part of the challenge is that no suitable mechanism exists to replace traditional intercept surveys in a way that ensures fairness and inclusion. The lack of labelled data has also impacted the training of AI algorithms. That is the lack of labels relevant to the target domains has made it hard to estimate the accuracy of the AI algorithms when they are applied to real world situations. In this paper, we propose a framework for collecting in-the-wild images and demographic labels from ordinary people (e.g., park visitors) that ensures that privacy is integrated at every stage of the data collection process from storage to processing and sharing.},

To explore how drivers can make better navigation decisions, we conducted a pilot Wizard-of-Oz study that gives turn suggestions in conversations between two voice agents. We asked 30 participants to drive in a simulation environment using voice guidance that gives three types of suggestions: familiar, optimal, and new routes. We examined their route choices, perceived workload and utterances while driving. We found that while most drivers followed directions appropriate for the given scenarios, they were more likely to make inappropriate choices after hearing alternatives in conversations. On the other hand, two-party conversations allowed drivers to better reflect on their choices after trips. We conclude by discussing preliminary design implications for car navigation voice guidance specifically and recommender systems in general.},

abstract = {While studies in HCI4D have been advanced by the shift of perspective from developmental studies to a range of other discourses, current analytical concepts for understanding the sociality of society in Africa have arguably led to some misinterpretations of the place of technology. This provocation suggests that an 'African Standpoint' based on a combination of various standpoint positionalities and the Wittgensteinian approach of Winch can offer conceptual and analytical sensitivities for articulating social relations, transnational engagements and the conceptualisation of technological innovation. This provides an approach for seeing and accounting for things as they are - right here, right there and right now - and not some idealised conception of an African reality},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly augmenting and generating online content, but research suggests that users distrust content which they believe to be AI-generated. In this paper, we study whether introducing a confidence indicator, a text rating of an algorithm's confidence in its source data alongside rationale for why the data is more or less trustworthy, affects this distrust in Airbnb host profiles believed to be computer-generated. Our results indicate that a low-confidence indicator decreases participant trust in the rental host, but high-confidence indicators have no significant impact on trust. These findings suggest that user trust of AI-generated content can be negatively, but not positively, affected by a confidence indicator.},

abstract = {Exploratory data analysis is an open-ended iterative process, where the goal is to discover new insights. Much of the work to characterise this exploration stems from qualitative research resulting in rich findings, task taxonomies, and conceptual models. In this work, we propose a machine-learning approach where the structure of an exploratory analysis session is automatically learned. Our method, based on Hidden-Markov Models, automatically builds a storyline of past exploration from log data events, that shows key analysis scenarios and the transitions between analysts' hypotheses and research questions. Compared to a clustering method, this approach yields higher accuracy for detecting transitions between analysis scenarios. We argue for incorporating provenance views in exploratory data analysis systems that show, at minimum, the structure and intermediate results of past exploration. Besides helping the reproducibility of the different analyses and their results, this can encourage analysts to reflect upon and ultimately adapt their exploration strategies.},

In this study, we explored the effects of induced emotion on user performances in a time-constrained moving target selection task. We found that participants tended to select the targets faster but make more mistakes in positive emotion condition, while they select the targets slower with fewer mistakes in negative emotion condition.

However, post-stimuli self-reports are temporally imprecise, especially after watching 360° videos.

While the population of ICV users is gradually increasing, the motives underlying use of ICVs remain unclear. Here, we developed a scale to measure motives for ICV use. Taken the results of explorative factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis together, we suggested a four-factor model: symbolic, instrumental, affective-self, and affective-other motives. We found that ICV users with different characteristics in age, annual income and driving distance evaluated the importance of motives differently. ICV users who are richer and drive longer distances are more likely to show higher symbolic and affective-self motives. Also, users' symbolic motive grows with age. Finally, we found that symbolic and affective motives correlated highly with social norms and loyalty, while instrumental motives related to perceived control feelings toward operating the vehicle. These findings shed novel insights on how to design ICVs and make related policies.},

Our results suggest that comfort level influences these metrics but does not cause a person to ascribe a gender to a gender-neutral robot. These findings suggest that there is no need to perpetuate societal gender norms onto robots. However, even when designing for robot gender neutrality people are still more likely to ascribe a gender to the robot, but this gendering does not significantly impact occupational judgements.},

We then evaluated our recommendations on 10,000 actual customers, with a 45-45-10 split among ensemble, collaborative filtering, and control group. The overall predictive power employed with real users was 23%, with the ensemble method having a predictive power of 19% and 30% for collaborative filtering. Results indicate that, in complex and shifting domains such as this one, one cannot rely solely on historical data for evaluating the impact of user recommendations.

In this experiment, some participants encountered AI weaknesses early, while others encountered the same limitations later in the study. The difference in ordering had a significant impact on user understanding of the system and the ability to detect AI strengths and weaknesses, and the addition of explanations was not enough to counteract the strong effects of early impressions. The results demonstrate the importance of first impressions with intelligent systems and motivate the need for improved methods of intervention to combat automation bias.},

abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of measuring and predicting temporal video saliency - a metric which defines the importance of a video frame for human attention. Unlike the conventional spatial saliency which defines the location of the salient regions within a frame (as it is done for still images), temporal saliency considers importance of a frame as a whole and may not exist apart from context. The proposed interface is an interactive cursor-based algorithm for collecting experimental data about temporal saliency. We collect the first human responses and perform their analysis. As a result, we show that qualitatively, the produced scores have very explicit meaning of the semantic changes in a frame, while quantitatively being highly correlated between all the observers.Apart from that, we show that the proposed tool can simultaneously collect fixations similar to the ones produced by eye-tracker in a more affordable way. Further, this approach may be used for creation of first temporal saliency datasets which will allow training computational predictive algorithms. The proposed interface does not rely on any special equipment, which allows to run it remotely and cover a wide audience.},

Our study results showed limited impact of association type on participants of low cognitive ability. In contrast, for participants of high cognitive ability, their discrimination of fake news from real news tended to be worse for the associative inference condition than for the other two conditions. Thus, our findings suggest that individuals of high cognitive ability are likely to be susceptible to form the belief of fake news, but differently from those of low cognitive ability.},

Prior research focused on people's trust in AVs based on AVs' overall performance. The present study is focused on people's trust change in AVs over time in a sequential decision making context. We conducted a human-in-the-loop experiment with 16 participants in a virtual 3D environment wherein participants acted as passengers riding an AV. We manipulated two independent variables: level of stochasticity (high vs. low) and source of stochasticity (external vs. internal). Dependent variables included participants' moment-to-moment trust in AVs and post-experiment trust. Our results revealed that when the stochasticity was due to internal errors (e.g. AV's sensor errors) as compared to external errors (e.g. traffic jams or road blocks), participants' trust in AVs decreased more significantly. Also, the larger the cost due to an error, the larger the trust decrement.},

We implemented Social Engineer, a VR-based educational game teaching basic knowledge about social engineering (SE). In two user studies, we will evaluate the performance of the progress assessment and the effects of the intervention through adaptive hints on the players' experience and learning effects.

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) enables immersive applications that make rich content available independent of time and space. By replacing or supplementing physical face-to-face meetings, VR could also radically change how we socially interact with others. Despite this potential, the effect of transferring physical collaborative experience into a virtual one is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the experience differences between a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) and a physical environment. We used a museum visit as a task since it is a typical social experience and a promising use case for VR. 48 participants experienced the task in real and virtual environments, either alone or with a partner. Despite the potential of CVEs, we found that being in a virtual environment has adverse effects on the experience which is reinforced by being in the environment with another person. Based on quantitative and qualitative results, we provide recommendations for the design of future multi-user virtual environments.},

abstract = {Social Virtual Reality (VR) invites multiple users to "interact" in a shared immersive environment, which creates new opportunities for remote communication, and can potentially be a new tool for remote medical consultations. Using knee osteoarthritis consultation as a use case, this paper presents a social VR clinic that allows patients to consult a nurse represented as a virtual avatar with head, upper body and hands visible. We started with an ethnographic study at a hospital with three medical professionals and observed three patient consultation sessions to map the patient treatment journey (PTJ) and distill design requirements for social VR consultation. Based on the results of the study, we designed and implemented a social VR clinic to meet the identified requirements. Our work expands on the potential of social VR to help reshape patient treatment by reducing the workload of medical staff and the travel time of patients. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to compare face-to-face (F2F) with social VR consultations.},

Road systems vary in various aspects such as the number of lanes, right of way, and configuration. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, this system will change. Research has already addressed the missing communication possibilities when no human driver is needed. However, there is no common evaluation standard for the proposed external communication concept with respect to the complexity of the traffic system. We have therefore investigated the evaluation of these in Virtual Reality, in monitor-based, and in prototypical setups with special regard to scalability. We found that simulated traffic noise is a non-factor in current evaluations and that involving multiple people and multiple lanes with numerous vehicles is scarce.},

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is gradually becoming used for navigation in urban environments, allowing users to see instructions in their physical environment. However, viewing this information through a smartphone's screen is not ideal, as it can cause users to become inattentive to their surroundings. AR head-mounted displays (HMD) have the potential to overcome this issue by integrating navigational information into the user's field of view (FOV). While work has explored the design of turn-by-turn egocentric AR navigation interfaces, little work has explored the design of exocentric interfaces, which provide the user with an overview of their desired route. In response to this, we examined the impact of three different exocentric AR map displays on pedestrian navigation performance and user experience. Our work highlights pedestrian safety concerns and provides design implications for future AR HMD pedestrian navigation interfaces.},

abstract = {Advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and processing power of mobile devices have created a surge in the number of mobile AR applications. Nevertheless, many AR applications have adopted surface gestures as the default method for interaction with virtual content. In this paper, we investigate two gesture modalities, surface and motion, for operating mobile AR applications. In order to identify optimal gestures for various interactions, we conducted an elicitation study with 21 participants for 12 tasks, which yielded a total of 504 gestures. We classified and illustrated the two sets of gestures, and compared them in terms of goodness, ease of use, and engagement. The elicitation process yielded two separate sets of user-defined gestures; legacy surface gestures, which were familiar and easy to use by the participants, and motion gestures, which had better engagement. From the interaction patterns of this second set of gestures, we propose a new interaction class called TMR (Touch-Move-Release), which defines for mobile AR.},

Currently, few task-oriented chatbots had employed emotion strategies together with problem solving process. Meanwhile, customers can have different preference across channels (e.g., social media and webpages). This paper presented the design for a series of emotional strategies (ES) combined with task-solving, and tested its effectiveness across channels. In the multi-channel service chatbot, Moli, we compared ES with brief apology (BA) and no emotion responses (NER) in a Wizard of Oz study. The results indicated the effectiveness of the emotion strategies borrowed from psychotherapy technologies. Meanwhile, we found customers preferred brief and direct strategies on webpage, whereas rich emotional strategies in all stages were more favorable on social media. With detailed strategy design, the "cold comfort" was found helpful for building human-machine relationships, pacifying emotions, and improving satisfaction and system usability.},

Previous gesture studies under a user-centered approach have neglected the effects of visual characteristics of interface objects. To validate the effects, we collect users' multiple gesture responses through a gesture elicitation experiment for nine functions on thirteen stimuli systemically manipulated by visual properties. In the analyses, we investigate on 1) user agreements for the function-gesture mappings, and 2) differences in gesture selection in terms of the visual pattern. In the results, users respond differently in gesture selection in terms of the visual pattern-layout and number of images. This result indicates that designers should consider the visual properties of on-screen objects beyond user-elicited gestures. This study contributes toward a method for designing intuitive gestures on the touchscreen.},

abstract = {Drivers and pedestrians use various culturally-based nonverbal cues such as head movements, hand gestures, and eye contact when crossing roads. With the absence of a human driver, this communication becomes challenging in autonomous vehicle (AV)- pedestrian interaction. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) for AV-pedestrian interaction are being developed based on the research conducted mainly in North America and Europe, where the traffic and pedestrian behavior are very structured and follow the rules. In other cultures (e.g., South Asia), this can be very unstructured (e.g., pedestrians spontaneously crossing the road at non-cross walks is not very uncommon). However, research on investigating cross-cultural differences in AV-Pedestrian interaction is scarce. This research focuses on investigating cross-cultural differences in AV-Pedestrian interaction to gain insights useful for designing better eHMIs. This paper details three cross-cultural studies designed for this purpose, and that will be deployed in two different cultural settings: Sri Lanka and Germany.},

The method is implemented as a small portable recording device, and a data visualization software. A field study was conducted in an amusement park to test the proposed approach. Emotional maps highlighting the areas where users experienced varying levels of arousal are presented. We also discuss insights uncovered, and how UX practitioners could use the approach to bring their own research into the wild.},

Yet a major opportunity remains in the design of new, synthesized visualizations that help researchers and practitioners to gain more insights in the vast tracking data. We present Dandelion Diagram, a synthesized heatmap technique that combines both teachers' positioning and orientation (heading) data, and affords richer representations in addition to whereabouts-For example, teachers' attention pattern (which directions they were attending to), and their mobility pattern (i.e., trajectories in the classroom).

abstract = {Monologue style lecture video is the majority format delivered on most distance learning platforms such as MOOCs. However, studies found that observing dialogue between a tutor and a tutee could produce better learning than the monologue one, as the observer student learns more from the tutee than the tutor when they are observing the dialogue. In this study, we enhanced the existing monologue video into a dialogue-like video by adding a tutee agent. We propose a system that transforms monologue video into a dialogue-like video. In the initial user study, we found that most of the observer students in our experiment preferred watching dialogue-like lecture videos with tutee agent and had better learning experiences than the monologue one.},

abstract = {The advancement of technology has paved the way for sophisticated school violence detection and intervention systems. Existing researches, however, have come short of reflecting the goals and contexts of the target users: teachers, students, and parents. Therefore, we conducted interviews with 35 teachers about school violence and technology adoption. While there was wide consensus on the necessity of technology, the teachers pointed out the possible adverse effects of its adoption: greater burden on teachers, privacy concerns, and consequences of inaccurate algorithms. Based on the findings, we derived design implications in the stages of data collection, decision making, and data conveyance. These design implications could make a contribution towards shaping the design of school violence detection and intervention system from the teachers' perspective.},

abstract = {A learner's guessing behavior while playing educational games can be a key indicator of her disengagement that impacts learning negatively. To distinguish a learner's guessing behavior from solution behavior, we present an explorative study of using motion features, which represent a learner's finger movements on a tablet screen. Our data was collected from the Missing Number game of KitKit School, a tablet-based math game designed for children from pre-K to grade 2 in elementary school. A total of 5,040 problem solving logs, which were collected from 168 students, were analyzed. A two-sample t-test showed a significant difference between guessing and solution behavior for four groups of motion features that indicate distance, curvedness, complexity, and pause (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, our empirical results showed the possibility of using motion features in automatic detection of guessing behavior. Our best model yielded an accuracy of 0.778 and AUC value of 0.851 by using the random forest classifier.},

In this paper, we examine whether group size would influence the effects of goal setting and goal sharing on reducing academic procrastination. Through a three-week field study followed by interviews, 21 participants were randomly assigned to three 2-people groups and three 5-people groups. They used a suite of mobile applications to set up their study goals, track their study and distraction time, and share their goals with other group members for 2 weeks. Results suggest that the 5-people groups had achieved better outcomes than the 2-people groups considering less fluctuation and more deduction in average distraction rate (distraction time divided by study time). We conclude by proposing several design implications concerning the design of mobile applications to reduce academic procrastination, and identify several future research directions on this topic.},

We develop a task that requires learning Rust syntax and comprehending the Rust-specific approach to mutability and ownership. Our results show that users spend 43% of online time viewing example code and that programmers appreciate in-line compiler errors, choosing to refresh, on average, every 30.6 seconds after first discovering this feature. The average time between these refreshes predicted total task time, but individual resource choices did not. Based on our findings we offer design implications for language and IDE developers.},

User experience (UX) focuses on improving user interactions, but little work has investigated how companies factor user experience into the security and privacy design of smart home devices as a means of addressing these concerns. To explore this in more detail, we designed and conducted six in-depth interviews with employees of a large smart home company in the United Kingdom. We analyzed the data using Grounded Theory, and found little evidence that UX is a consideration for the security design of these devices. Based on the results of our study, we proposed user-centered design guidelines and recommendations to improve data protection in smart homes.},

Past research indicates that web surveys come with disadvantages, such as poor response quality caused by inattention, survey fatigue or satisficing behavior. To test if conversational interfaces have a positive impact on the level of enjoyment and the response quality, we design an NLP-based conversational agent and deploy it in a field experiment with 127 students in our lecture and compare it with a web survey as a baseline. Our findings indicate that using conversational agents for evaluations are resulting in higher levels of response quality and level of enjoyment, and are therefore, a promising approach to increase the effectiveness of surveys in general.},

abstract = {People with dementia often experience a lack of social engagement after moving from the home environment into long-term care. Professional caregivers aim to build social relations with residents in dementia care homes to empower and socially include them during everyday care. However, the natural imbalance between the caregiver and the cared-for positions the person with dementia in a passive role, making it difficult for them to initiate and build relations with caregivers. In this paper, we present 'Turnaround' as a design exploration into care relations and the potential role of design to support these relations. Turnaround is a musical interface to facilitate collaborative acts of music-making. Our preliminary results reveal how the role of resident and caregiver shifted towards equal partnership during the exploration and interaction with Turnaround. Furthermore, we argue that technologies should foster partnerships in care activities by facilitating shared forms of expression and reinforcement of agency.},

Stress monitoring and management, with the aim to analyze or mitigate the effects of stress, are an active area of research. A promising approach for detecting stress is by measuring bio-signals such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) or an electrocardiogram (ECG). In this study, we introduce a wearable in- and over-ear device that measures EEG and ECG signals simultaneously. The device is composed of dry and soft sensing electrodes which are conformally integrated on the surface of earbuds. We carried out a pilot study exposing test subjects to three standard stressors (stroop, memory search, and mental arithmetic) while measuring their EEG and ECG signals. Preliminary results indicate the feasibility of classifying various stress conditions using a convolutional neural network.},

Guided compassion-focused (CF) imagery has shown to be successful in reducing these negative emotions and paranoid thoughts. However, some individuals have difficulties with CF imagery. By enabling a sense of presence, immersive virtual environments can overcome these limitations and induce specific emotional responses to support the development of self-compassionate feelings. In our study, we compared an immersive CF (CF-VR) with a controlled VR condition in a student sample of N = 21 participants with slightly elevated symptoms of paranoia. A virtual mission on the moon was designed and implemented to induce self-compassionate feelings with the help of interacting with a space nebula that represented the power of compassion. Our results show that the CF-VR intervention was well accepted and effective in reducing state paranoid thoughts. Worry decreased significantly within the CF-VR group, while self-compassion increased.},

Specifically, we report three single case studies with a functional prototype. This prototype supported creating implementation intentions, putting them into a calendar, and being reminded through an object representative for the planned activity. Through the prototype, all three participants engaged more in the activities chosen to fulfill the intention. All in all, the notion of supporting individual implementation intentions through technology seems a viable strategy to support behavior change.},

abstract = {The only known therapy for stroke, a major leading cause of death and disability, has to be administered within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms for it to be effective. Accurately diagnosing a stroke as soon as possible after it occurs is difficult as it requires a subjective evaluation by a clinician in a hospital. With the narrow time window required for diagnosis, stroke evaluation would benefit from being aided by computational approaches that identify and quantify stroke symptoms in an efficient way. Here, we propose the design of a novel interface that provides clinicians with visualizations of the results of a machine learning-based technological aid for stroke diagnosis. To effectively support clinicians in determining stroke type, the proposed approach allows them to compare their own manual stroke evaluation with the results of the diagnostic system. By developing and evaluating our prototypes with neurologists, we explore how to best integrate technological aids into busy hospital workflows without burdening clinicians or biasing their decision making processes. We found that properly balancing the predictions of humans with that of technology is key to promoting the adoption of the latter in hospitals.},

Both groups completed initial assessments and daily reports, and the experimental groups interacted with Sunny. Exit interviews indicated three key themes: 1) Sunny prompted self-reflection, boosting participants' senses of self-worth and the depth of their relationships, 2) using Sunny encouraged participants to send heartfelt messages they would not have shared otherwise, 3) participants enjoyed accessing positive messages "on-demand". Experimental groups showed an average increase in psychological wellbeing of 1.73 (std = 6.08), compared to 0.5 (std = 5.94) in control. Our results suggest that an AI-based chatbot like Sunny could provide preventative care, promoting strong social connections and psychological wellbeing.},

We identified a set of design considerations that focused on enriching data collection, improving the accessibility of information, and blending the decision support into the workflow. To demonstrate these insights, we developed the concept of an AI-based OH consultation, called ConsultAI. ConsultAI is a conversational assistant that can provide real-time decision support to OH physicians during clinical interviews.

abstract = {We introduce a novel interactive narrative exhibit supporting general public learning about Hip Hop culture and history developed as a collaboration of the MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality, the Universal Hip Hop Museum, and Microsoft and supported by the TunesMap Educational Foundation and internationally known Afrofuturist artists Black Kirby. The exhibit's narrative system is personalized by categorizing users based on evaluating their input data light of a social psychology-based model based in musical identity theory. The system uses user input to determine which interactive narrative and customized music playlist to present to the user. The system has been deployed as the central interactive display within the [R]Evolution of Hip Hop for an exhibit of the Universal Hip Hop Museum. Future work will involve analysis of user feedback data from the thousands of local and international exhibit visitors to determine the impact of personalization on visitor engagement, satisfaction, and learning.},

abstract = {User perceptions of personas affect the adoption of personas for decision-making in real organizations. To investigate how experience affects the way an individual perceives a persona, we conduct an experimental study with individuals less and more experienced with personas. Quantitative results show that previous experience increases several important perceptions, including willingness to use, empathy, likability, and completeness. Results suggest that methods that increase experience (e.g., training, workshops, scenarios) should be applied alongside persona deployment, as desirable persona perceptions increase with individuals' experience.},

We investigated a seminar in which design students built machines for musicians to improvise with. We explored the experiences of musicians when improvising with non-human musicians, as well as the challenges of designing non-human musicians. Among other things, we found that while from an outside perspective, the machines appeared as independent actors that interact with the musicians, the musicians experienced them as additional instruments they controlled. The interaction design of non-human actors was challenging for designers.},

abstract = {Wearable technology for sports and fitness have increased in popularity in the last decade, but most technological solutions in research are designed for a single specific fitness practice and target group. Towards validating a design approach and resulting wearable designs across several fitness practices, we used three wearable Training Technology Probes (TTPs) originally designed for, and tested in, the context of Yoga and Circus training. They were used in a design activity with the goal of exploring and opening up the design space of technology for weightlifting. Our exploration proved fruitful and substantiated the versatility, adaptability and usefulness of the TTPs on account of their design features. Here we present initial insights from deploying the TTPs in that domain. The TTPs served as probing tools, helping to surface goals and challenges of weightlifting. They were appropriated to fit and assist in new TTP uses for weightlifting exercises, leading to interesting design iterations that will inform future work.},

abstract = {Underwater robot is essential equipment for exploring the marine environment. It is important that children get exposed to these technologies as earlier as possible, especially there is a high demand for developing expertise and awareness in the underwater robot. Although examples of making toolkit for children currently exist, few focus specifically on integration with the water environment. In this paper, we explore the making toolkit, ModBot, which can be applied to the water environment. The hardware was developed using electronic, counterweight, and shape modules that can be manipulated to build underwater robots. The software application allows children to learn concepts and receive construction feedback. This paper presents the system design of ModBot, the design rationale, and a user study for the usability of ModBot. Our system is expected to spark children's interests and creativity of underwater robots, and foster their understanding of the water environment.},

We conducted a citation analysis of 70 published texts that cited this paper, using the Harwood functions to identify how feminist theory concepts have been cited in HCI and whether the implementation of proposed frameworks has taken place. This paper was mostly given 'credit,' and most frequently 'signposted' to keep readers on track of the topical issues in HCI, with little evidence of explicit use or extension of proposed frameworks. These results demonstrate a largely one-dimensional impact, characterized by a lack of deep engagement in feminist theories. We identify opportunities to expand feminist approach to further improve research and practice in HCI.},

We conducted a photography capturing task with four design researchers to understand how they interpret and perceive these time concepts. We then created two design speculations based on their perceptions and interpretations to illustrate how emerging time concepts can inspire new design ideas around representations of time.},

Through semi-structured interviews and a participatory workshop, current home modifications and the challenges involved in the process of implementation were investigated, and an AR prototype was co-designed with the OTs. They found the AR tool to be potentially beneficial as it allows them to search, find, and select assistive technologies (ATs) for use in homes and to demonstrate the home-modification plans to users. The tool will enable users to envision the most appropriate scenarios when purchasing and utilizing ATs in the home.},

abstract = {Conversational systems are inherently disadvantaged when indicating either what capabilities they have or the state they are in. The notion of habitability, the appropriate balancing in design between the language people use and the language a system can accept, emerged out of these early difficulties with conversational systems. This literature review aims to summarize progress in habitability research and explore implications for the design of current AI-enabled conversational systems. We found that i) the definitions of habitability focus mostly on matching between user expectations and system capabilities by employing well-balanced restrictions on language use; ii) there are two comprehensive design perspectives on different domains of habitability; iii) there is one standardized questionnaire with a sub-scale to measure habitability in a limited way. The review has allowed us to propose a working definition of habitability and some design implications that may prove useful for guiding future research and practice in this field.},

abstract = {During VR demos we have performed over last few years, many participants (in the absence of any haptic feedback) have commented on their perceived ability to 'feel' differences between simulated molecular objects. The mechanisms for such 'feeling' are not entirely clear: observing from outside VR, one can see that there is nothing physical for participants to 'feel'. Here we outline exploratory user studies designed to evaluate the extent to which participants can distinguish quantitative differences in the flexibility of VR-simulated molecular objects. The results suggest that an individual's capacity to detect differences in molecular flexibility is enhanced when they can interact with and manipulate the molecules, as opposed to merely observing the same interaction. Building on these results, we intend to carry out further studies investigating humans' ability to sense quantitative properties of VR simulations without haptic technology.},

We video-recorded 5 meetings (N=16) and coded the number of position changes per participant. Participants also filled out a pre- and post-questionnaire about their experience. Our findings show that PositionPeak triggers people to adopt a variety of postures. Participants on average experienced a more efficient meeting but reported physical discomfort with some objects.

It is developed by connecting miniaturized flexible printed circuit boards as two-dimensional sensor arrays with stretchable interconnects. The system is embedded in between soft deformable layers, such as textiles or rubbers. The result is a soft sensate surface that can be distributed and conformally wrap and adapt to curved structures. Each node contains a microprocessor together with a collection of nine sensors and a light-emitting diode, providing multimodal data that can be used to detect various deformation, proxemic, tactile, and environmental changes. We show that the electronic skin can sense and respond to a variety of stimuli simultaneously, as well as open up a possibility for sensor-rich virtual and augmented reality-based visualization and interaction.},

abstract = {Modern electronic design automation (EDA) tooling tends to focus on either the system-level design or the low-level electrical connectivity between physical components on a printed circuit board (PCB). We believe that a usable and functional system for circuit design needs to be able to interleave both levels of abstraction seamlessly and allow designers to transition between them freely. Existing work has experimented with approaches like circuit synthesis, functional characterization, or fine grained physical modeling. Each of these approaches augment the design process as it exists today, with its fundamental split between various levels of abstraction. We notice that hierarchical block diagrams can capture both high-level system structure as well as fine grained physical connectivity, and use that symmetry to construct a model for electronic circuits that can span the entire design process. Additionally, we construct user interfaces for our model that can support users of different skill levels throughout a design task. We discuss the design of our system, detailing both fundamental abstractions and usability trade-offs, and demonstrate its current capabilities through the design of example electronics projects.},

abstract = {Technological advances in autonomous transportation systems have brought them closer to road use. However, little research is reported on children's behavior in autonomous buses (ABs) under real road conditions and on improving parents' trust in leaving their children alone in ABs. Thus, we aim to answer the research question: "How can we design ABs suitable for unaccompanied children so that the parents can trust them?" We conducted a study using a Wizard-of-Oz method to observe children's behavior and interview both parents and children to examine their needs in ABs. Using an affinity diagram, we grouped children's and parents' needs under the following categories: entertainment, communication, personal behavior, trust and desires. Using an iterative human-centered design process, we created an Otto system, a smartphone app for parents to communicate with their children and a tablet app for children to entertain during the ride.},

However, most of existing video platforms display video search results in generic ranked lists based on relevance to queries. These relevance-based information display does not take into account the inner structure of the knowledge domain, and may not suit the need of online learners. In this paper, we present ConceptGuide, a prototype system for learning orientations to support ad hoc online learning from unorganized video materials. ConceptGuide features a computational pipeline that performs content analysis on the transcripts of YouTube videos queried by the user and generates concept-map-based visual recommendations of conceptual and content links between videos, forming learning pathways to provide structures feasible and usable for learners to consume.},

We present a novel application based on virtual reality (VR) to support furniture store consultations. Our system allows customers to elaborate different configurations of a couch in dialogue with a sales expert and lets customers experience them through immersive VR in a variety of virtual environments. While the sales-expert can modify the couch layout and fabric, the customer can stay immersed and experience a realistic tactile feeling of the configured couch through passive haptic feedback provided by a sample piece the customer can sit on. A preliminary field study in a furniture store showed that the system is immersive, conveying realistic impressions of the couch configurations. Customers perceived the VR configurator as useful since it would make their purchase decisions easier.},

Less frequently, human-agent competitions have been held to gauge the relative competence of humans vs. agents, or agents vs. agents as measured indirectly by their performance against humans. We are developing a platform that supports a new type of AI competition that involves both agent-agent and human-agent interactions situated in an immersive environment. In this competition, human buyers haggle (in English) with two life-size AI agents that attempt to sell them various goods. We describe several research challenges that arise in this context, present the platform architecture and accompanying technologies, and report on early experiments with simple agents that establish feasibility and suggest that human participants enjoy the experience.},

By integrating conductive elements into the tangibles' sides, communication between embedded microprocessors is enabled, such that a connected composition can be computed without relying on any marker tracking information. Consequently, the virtual counterparts of the tangibles can be aligned, and this virtual composition can be attached to a single marker as a whole, increasing the tracking robustness towards occlusions and perspective distortions. A technical evaluation shows that this approach provides more robust augmentations if a tangible block in a composition is occluded by at least 50% or perspectively distorted by at least 40 to 50 degrees, depending on the block's size. Additionally, a test with users relying on the use case of a couch configuration tool shows promising results regarding usability and user experience.},

As a first step to understanding what we can learn from these stakeholders to aid the design of exergames, we conducted one in-depth interview with a PE teacher and several focus groups with children. Our findings showed that, although both children and the PE teacher like similar game elements, children viewed the elements through the lens of fun while the PE teacher viewed the elements through the lens of effectiveness. Our preliminary findings establish the importance of including such stakeholders in the formative design of exergames.},

We assessed pre- and post-test changes in levels of self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and intent to act relating to various preparedness and response actions. We found that playing the game increases these scores significantly in all game conditions immediately after play. Where avatar characteristics were significant, more resources led to higher scores. However, contrary to our predictions, randomly assigned avatars led to higher increases in scores than when players chose and named their avatar.

abstract = {Video accessibility is crucial for blind and visually impaired individuals for education, employment, and entertainment purposes. However, professional video descriptions are costly and time-consuming. Volunteer-created video descriptions could be a promising alternative, however, they can vary in quality and can be intimidating for novice describers. We developed a Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning (HILML) approach to video description by automating video text generation and scene segmentation while allowing humans to edit the output. Our HILML system was significantly faster and easier to use for first-time video describers compared to a human-only control condition with no machine learning assistance. The quality of the video descriptions and understanding of the topic created by the HILML system compared to the human-only condition were rated as being significantly higher by blind and visually impaired users.},

abstract = {People have an innate ability to process environmental information by integrating and updating multiple streams of sensory input. When local and global visual information are not integrated smoothly, it becomes difficult for an individual to formulate the whole from the details. This ability is important when it comes to understanding a scene or "seeing the big picture." In this work, we design, develop, and evaluate a system to augment the integration of global with local features, alongside Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) who work with autistic children having significant speech and language disorders. We present our preliminary experiment with a high-fidelity global filter and hypothesize that the filtered image can shift eye gaze (and therefore visual attention) from local details to global features. Global interpretation will be further encouraged by asking participants "what was the picture about?" We present results and discuss limitations and future work.},

The technologies to navigate blind pedestrians in public spaces are rapidly improving, but tasks which require to understand surrounding people's behavior are still difficult to assist. Standing in line at shops, stations, and other crowded places is one of such tasks. Therefore, we developed a system to detect and notify the distance to a person in front continuously by using a smartphone with a RGB camera and an infrared depth sensor. The system alerts three levels of distance via vibration patterns to allow users to start/stop moving forward to the right position at the right timing. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we performed a study with six blind people. We observed that the system enables blind participants to stand in line successfully, while also gaining more confidence.},

While we can model speed and timing of human signers from video recordings, prior work has suggested that users prefer animations to be slower than videos of humans signers. However, no prior study had systematically examined the multiple parameters of ASL timing, which include: sign duration, transition time, pausing frequency, pausing duration, and differential signing rate. In an experimental study, 16 native ASL signers provided subjective preference judgements during a side-by-side comparison of ASL animations in which each of these five parameters was varied. We empirically identified and report users' preferences for each of these individual timing parameters of ASL animation.},

We found when older people feel connected to others while doing crowd work, they are highly motivated. Furthermore, gamification is an effective tool for fostering their engagement when aligned with their needs and values, as opposed to the needs and values of younger participants.

Information foraging theory illustrates that users' information behavior is guided by the use of information scent (mostly visual in GUIs) to assess value and cost of accessing information relevant to their goal, and rational decisions to maximize gain of information. Previous research about adaptive browsing behavior of screen reader users is associated with a lack of webpage usability. In this study, we observed and compared the information seeking behavior of ten sighted and ten screen reader users. Findings show that screen reader users demonstrate adapted mental models of the visual information search interface. Additionally, their adaptive search result exploration strategies in the context of query intent highlight key concern areas in specific parts of the search process.},

Losing the memories of meaningful social activities, such as visits from family, can be confronting not only for the person with dementia, but also for relatives and caretakers. Through an iterative design process involving people with dementia, caretakers and relatives, the RelivRing concept was developed. The RelivRing enables people with dementia to relive the positive experience of visits from relatives. It allows relatives to leave audio messages of their visits, which the person with dementia might have otherwise forgotten. When listening to these messages, the person with dementia can re-experience the positive feeling of the visit. The design is adapted to a person with dementia's cognitive and perceptual abilities following literature research and in-context user studies. With the RelivRing, we aim to maintain and strengthen existing social relations between people with dementia and their relatives.},

To gain an understanding of their efficacy, we provided a circuit description [3], component diagrams (Figure 4), and a tactile schematic [9] as educational materials in a Blind Arduino workshop with eight participants and interviewed these participants about their experience. Our research revealed the complexities of designing these materials: our tactile component diagrams were usable and helpful, whereas our tactile schematics and circuit descriptions presented learning barriers in a microcontroller workshop. We provide recommendations for future research to design accessible materials to teach electronics.},

We present Cast, a platform that allows an organizer to concisely define a story script that is opportunistically deployed to users through a context-aware mobile app. Leveraging user contexts to define their roles within a story provides users with scaffolds that promote cohesive narrative development, and automating this process prevents burdening the organizer. Results from a pilot study show that creating stories with Cast is engaging yet low-effort for participants, showcasing the potential for context-awareness to make collaborative storytelling easier without sacrificing enjoyability.},

abstract = {Mediated social touch has the potential to enhance our interactions with machines and with each other. We present three wearable tactile devices that generate affective haptic sensations via three localised skin stretching modalities; pinching, squeezing, and twisting. The Pinch device is adhered to the skin of the forearm, generating pinching sensations in three locations. The Squeeze and Twist devices are wristbands that elicit squeezing and twisting sensations on the skin of the wrist. All of these devices are powered by shape memory alloy actuators, enabling them to be quiet, lightweight and discreet wearable interfaces, unlike their vibrotactile or servo-motor driven counterparts. We investigate the potential for these devices to be used in mediated social touch interactions by conducting preliminary psychometric tests measuring affective response. The Pinch device and Squeeze wristband were found to simulate positive affective touch sensations, particularly in comparison to vibrotactile stimuli.},

Selecting a word requires not only precision but also switching between selections and typing which influences both speed and error rates. In this paper, we evaluate a novel concept that extends text editing with an additional modality, that is gaze. We present a user study (N=16) where we explore how, the novel concepts called GazeButton can improve text selection by comparing it to touch based selection. In addition, we tested the effect of text size on the selection techniques by comparing two different text sizes.Results show that gaze based selection was faster with bigger text size, although not statistically significant. Qualitative feedback show a preference on gaze over touch which motivates a new direction of gaze usage in text editors.},

We present a system, called Hilo, that can monitor the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in an office and provide a fairly accurate forecast of its evolution in the next few minutes. The main objective is to inform and to support the users in taking preventive actions when a harmful level of CO2 is predicted. We elicited three main elements of such prediction — Risk, Temporal Proximity, and Certainty, and explored alternative ways of displaying indoor CO2 forecast through these elements. To evaluate our prototypes, we conducted a preliminary&nbsp;user study, in which three interfaces on Apple Watch were tested by 12 participants (within-subjects, a total of 36 sessions).&nbsp;In this paper, we describe the results of this study and discuss implications for future work on how to create an engaging interaction with the users about the quality of air in offices and particularly its forecast.},

Resonant properties change depending on the shape, material, and boundary conditions of the objects, so that our method identifies objects on the basis of differences in resonant properties caused by different inner structure patterns using a machine-learning algorithm. We measured resonant properties as frequency properties using active acoustic sensing. Our method is applicable to 3D-printed objects with a low filling rate while reducing the workload of modeling the inner structure to be used as a tag. To investigate the feasibility of our method, we conducted two experimental evaluations. The results of one showed that our method can identify eight objects with an average classification accuracy of 99.3%.},

How to predict the motion from image and visualize for training is a challenging topic for computer vision. In this paper, we present a real-time table tennis forecasting system using a long short-term pose prediction network. Our system can predict the landing point of a serve before the pingpong ball is even hit using the previous and present motions of a player, which is captured only using a single RGB camera. In the precision evaluation, our system shows an acceptable accuracy and the max difference is 8.9 cm. From another pilot study, we know that our system could help the amateur to return an expert's serve. As training application, this system can be either used for training beginner's prediction skill, or used for practitioners to train how to hide their serve from being predicted.},

Differentiating between fingertip and fingernail touches requires only tens of milliseconds worth of shunt current data from the capacitive touch sensing mechanism, thus external sensors or other hardware are unnecessary. Owing to the small amount of friction generated when a nail touches the surface, not only tapping but also touch gestures by sliding a nail can be easily performed. In our initial investigation, we confirmed that setting a simple threshold on the measured shunt current for recognition works robustly.},

Our system uses a grid-based approach which cuts small openings in different colored gels and layers them together, forming color combinations when lit. Our work expands the design space of lighting gels with a precise and expressive method, enabling designers to experiment with novel lighting effects through an iterative personal fabrication process.},

One problem of such head-mounted displays is the distraction caused by an unavoidable display of control elements even when focused on internal thoughts. In this project, we reduced this distraction by including information about the current attentional state. A multimodal smart-home environment was altered to adapt to the user's state of attention. The system only responded if the attentional orientation was classified as "external". The classification was based on multimodal EEG and eye tracking data. Seven users tested the attention-aware system in comparison to the unaware system. We show that the adaptation of the interface improved the usability of the system. We conclude that more systems would benefit from awareness of the user's ongoing attentional state.},

To provide detachable constraints on the tube for bending, we developed a novel technique with a hook-and-loop fastener attached on the tube. We also designed software to convert 3D targeted object shape to the bending pattern of the tube. Furthermore, we implemented a prototype of a machine for the automation of the attaching process of the fastener on the tube.

Results showed that subjects spent an average of 0.55 s to visually find and another 0.25 s before their finger selected a target. We also identified that, passive haptic feedback did not increase the performance of the user. Moreover, gaze tracker accuracy significantly deteriorated when subjects looked below their eye level. Our results also point out that practitioners/trainers should focus on reducing the time spent on searching for the next target to improve their performance through VR eye-hand coordination training systems.

Thus, identical conditions are obtained for all subjects which is not feasible in real world field research with naturally varying environmental influences. As a first step, our qualitative and quantitative user study revealed that walking in a VR treadmill felt safest and most intuitive, although walking in it took in return more energy than walking-in-place with VR trackers only.},

It has been suggested that robots speaking in a high pitch could be perceived as more attractive than those speaking in a low pitch. However, it is not clear whether the use of a high-pitched voice favors teleoperated robots as well. In principle, teleoperated robots could be perceived differently than autonomous robots because they embody a human agent. To investigate this aspect, we conducted a 2 (voice pitch: original vs. high) \texttimes{} 2 (voice gender: male vs. female) \texttimes{} 2 (user gender: male vs. female) between-participants experiment to study the effects of the robot voice pitch, robot voice gender, and user gender on the attitudinal responses of the users toward a teleoperated robot and the associated decision-making. It was observed that the male and female participants perceived a high-pitched voice differently. The users' awareness of the robot being teleoperated and persuasiveness of the robot were noted to be related, which may provide a plausible explanation for the interaction effects between the voice pitch and user gender.},

We present the design of a system, consisting of a toy robot, computer vision tracking, and a simple interaction model, that can show non-verbal social behaviors to influence a user's food choice. Finally, we discuss future studies and applications of this system, and provide suggestions for future research into Artificial Commensal Companions.},

abstract = {Locomotion in virtual reality (VR) is one of the biggest problems for large scale adoption of VR applications. Yet, to our knowledge, there are few studies conducted in-the-wild to understand performance metrics and general user preference for different mechanics. In this paper, we present the first steps towards an open framework to create a VR locomotion benchmark. As a viability study, we investigate how well the users move in VR when using three different locomotion mechanics. It was played in over 124 sessions across 10 countries in a period of three weeks. The included prototype locomotion mechanics are arm swing,walk-in-place and trackpad movement. We found that over-all, users performed significantly faster using arm swing and trackpad when compared to walk-in-place. For subjective preference, arm swing was significantly more preferred over the other two methods. Finally for induced sickness, walk-in-place was the overall most sickness-inducing locomotion method.},

abstract = {Among VR devices on the market, 'Nintendo Labo VR Kit (Labo VR)' has various pieces of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) hardware which are constructed from corrugated cardboard blueprints. While using the Labo VR, the user must hold the Labo HMD with both hands and this prevents the simultaneous use of other input devices. To overcome this limitation, we developed L-Visor which mimics Labo VR HMD but frees the hands to widen the virtual reality experience. In addition, we developed four prototype games for use with L-Visor. The results of our pilot user study showed that participants had positive impressions of L-Visor, because they felt L-Visor was intuitively consistent with the game content. This paper shows how to expand DIY's value in VR by creating a new cardboard visor input device for the Labo head-mounted display and by customizing game contents which allow users to interact with virtual environments in their own way.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) climbing systems registering physical climbing walls with immersive virtual environments (IVEs) have been a focus of past research. Such systems can provide physical user experiences similar to climbing in (extreme) outdoor environments. While in the real world, climbers can always see their hands and feet, virtual representations of limbs need to be spatially tracked and accurately rendered in VR, which increases system complexity. In this work, we investigated the importance of integrating virtual representations of the climber's hands and/or feet in VR climbing systems. We present a basic solution to track, calibrate and represent the climber's hands and feet, and report the results of a user study, comparing the importance of virtual limb representations in terms of perceived hand and feet movement accuracy, and enjoyability of the VR climbing experience. Our study suggests that the inclusion of feet is more important than having a hand visualization.},

abstract = {Smart speakers have become an almost ubiquitous technology as they enable users to access conversational agents easily. Yet, the agents can only be activated using specific voice commands, i.e. a wake word. This, in turn, requires the device to constantly listen to and process sound, which represents a privacy issue for some users. Further, using the trigger word for the agent in a conversation with another human may lead to accidental triggers. Here, we propose using gestural triggers for conversational agents. We conducted gesture elicitation to identify five candidate gestures. We then conducted a user study to investigate the acceptability and effort required to perform the gestures. Initial results indicate that the snap gesture shows the most potential. Our work contributes initial insights on using smart speakers with ubiquitous sensing.},

The activation of input can be precisely defined by the moment of finger contact, allowing the user to perform the input precisely at the desired moment. Finger contact is better suited to the user's mental model, and natural tactile feedback from the fingertip also benefits the user with the self-perception of the input. The experimental results revealed that using finger contact is the preferred method of input that increases the time-domain accuracy and enables the user to be aware of the moment the input is activated.},

abstract = {Contrary to our anticipation, consumption experiences do not always please us; instead, they sometimes impede our well-being. People often regret using their resources unfavorably (i.e., buyers' remorse or impulse buying) or take the pleasure of having something for granted before long (i.e., hedonic adaptation). Given its effects on optimizing positive experiences, positive emotion regulation can be useful for mitigating these issues. The present paper introduces PurPal, a self-administered behavioral intervention technology that enables users to up-regulate their positive emotions in the context of consumption. PurPal provides adaptive questions associated with users' purchase intentions, which stimulate reflection on possible future positive experiences with purchased items. A user study is planned to validate the efficacy of PurPal in a lab setting. The longer-term goal of the current research is to develop behavioral intervention technologies that support users' emotion regulation processes, enhancing their subjective well-being.},

Biometric authentication methods promise to fulfill both aspects to a high degree, yet they come with severe drawbacks, such as the lack of changeability of the utilized trait, in case it is leaked or stolen. To compensate for these disadvantages, we introduce a novel class of biometric authentication systems in this work, named "Functional Biometrics". This approach regards the human body as a function that transforms a stimulus which is applied to the body by the authentication system. Both, the stimulus and the measured body reflection form a pair that can subsequently be used for authentication, yet the underlying function remains secret. Following this approach, we intend to disprove some of the drawbacks of traditional biometrics.},

Users pinch with the thumb and fingertip to select from the same group of letters the finger would press on a QWERTY keyboard; a language model disambiguates. In a preliminary study with 14 participants, we investigated PinchType's speed and accuracy on initial use, as well as its physical comfort relative to a mid-air keyboard. After entering 40 phrases, most people reported that PinchType was more comfortable than the mid-air keyboard. Most participants reached a mean speed of 12.54 WPM, or 20.07 WPM without the time spent correcting errors. This compares favorably to other thumb-to-finger virtual text entry methods.},

We show that hand movement patterns performed during interactions with a knowledge-based authentication scheme (e.g., when entering a PIN) can be leveraged to establish an additional security layer. Based on a dataset gathered in a lab study with 23 participants, we show that knowledge-driven behavioural biometric authentication increases security in an unobtrusive way. We achieve an accuracy of up to 98.91% by applying a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on 32 authentications per subject.

To overcome these deficiencies, we are developing Massif, an interactive tool for deciphering adversarial attacks. Massif identifies and interactively visualizes neurons and their connections inside a DNN that are strongly activated or suppressed by an adversarial attack. Massif provides both a high-level, interpretable overview of the effect of an attack on a DNN, and a low-level, detailed description of the affected neurons. Massif's tightly coupled views help people better understand which input features are most vulnerable and important for correct predictions.},

Second, interactivity with augmented reality along the complete machine learning pipeline fosters rapid modeling. Third, collaboration enables a multi-user setting, wherein machine learning engineers and domain experts can jointly discuss the behavior of machine learning models. The effectiveness of our proof-of-concept is demonstrated in an experimental study involving both students and business professionals.

That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment.

abstract = {The success of deep learning solving previously-thought hard problems has inspired many non-experts to learn and understand this exciting technology. However, it is often challenging for learners to take the first steps due to the complexity of deep learning models. We present our ongoing work, CNN 101, an interactive visualization system for explaining and teaching convolutional neural networks. Through tightly integrated interactive views, CNN 101 offers both overview and detailed descriptions of how a model works. Built using modern web technologies, CNN 101 runs locally in users' web browsers without requiring specialized hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern deep learning techniques.},

abstract = {Automated cars will need to observe pedestrians and react adequately to their behavior when driving in urban areas. Judging pedestrian behavior, however, is hard. When approaching it by machine learning methods, large amounts of training data is needed, which is costly and difficult to obtain, especially for critical situations. In order to provide such data, we have developed an online game inspired by Frogger, in which players have to cross streets. Accidents and critical situations are a natural part of the data produced in such a way without anybody getting hurt in reality. We present the design of our game and an analysis of the resulting data and its match to real world behavior observed in previous work. We found that behavior patterns in real and virtual environments correlated and argue that game data could be used to train machine learning algorithms for predicting real pedestrians' walking trajectories when crossing a road. This approach could be used in future automated vehicles to increase pedestrian safety.},

However, when it comes to reusing groups of formulae along with layout and formatting, spreadsheets provide only limited support. Most users rely on copy and paste, which is easy to learn and use, but maintaining several copies can be tedious and error-prone. We present the concept of Gridlets, an abstraction over calculation and presentation applicable in common use case scenarios. Using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, we compare Gridlets to copy/paste and sheet-defined functions. We find that Gridlets are consistent with the spreadsheet paradigm, enable users to take advantage of secondary notation, and make common edit operations less viscous and less error-prone.},

abstract = {Research involving Virtual Reality (VR) headsets is becoming more and more popular. However, scaling VR experiments is challenging as researchers are often limited to using one or a small number of headsets for in-lab studies. One general way to scale experiments is through crowdsourcing so as to have access to a large pool of diverse participants with relatively little expense of time and money. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to crowdsource VR experiments. We demonstrate that it is possible to implement and run crowdsourced VR experiments using a pre-existing massively multiplayer online VR social platform - VRChat. Our small (n=10) demonstration experiment required participants to navigate a maze in VR. Participants searched for two targets then returned to the exit while we captured completion time and position over time. While there are some limitations with using VRChat, overall we have demonstrated a promising approach for running crowdsourced VR experiments.},

Virtual Reality (VR) was suggested as a simulation tool, allowing for fast, flexible and iterative design processes. In this controlled study, we evaluated whether VR is a valid platform for testing social interaction between people and non-humanoid robots. Our quantitative findings indicate that social interpretations associated with two types of gestures of a robotic object are similar in virtual and physical interactions with the robot, suggesting that the core aspects of social interaction with non-humanoid robots are preserved in a VR simulation. The impact of this work to the CHI community is in indicating the potential of VR as a platform for initial evaluations of social experiences with non-humanoid robots, including interaction studies that involve different facets of the social experience.},

The field of Design typically deals with form and function and is executed in molecules or pixels. But algorithms have neither. More importantly, algorithms may be biased in their execution against those without privileged status such as people of color, children, and the non-affluent. In this paper, we review our work on exploring perceptions of fairness in AI through co-design sessions with children of color in non-affluent neighborhoods of Baltimore City. The design sessions aimed at designing an artificially intelligent librarian for their local branch. Our preliminary findings showcase three key themes of this group's perceptions of fairness in the context of an artificially intelligent authority figure.},

Our results show that adapting the voice tonality can significantly influence subjective self-reported ratings as well as different aspects of driving performance.},

abstract = {Advancement in digital civics and the emergence of online platforms have enabled vast amounts of community members to share their input on various civic proposals. The intricacy of the community input analysis process, coupled with the increased scale of community engagement, makes community input analysis particularly challenging. Civic leaders, who gather, analyze, and make critical decisions based on community input, struggle to make sense of large-scale unstructured community input due to lack of time, analytical skills, and specialized technologies. In this qualitative study, we investigated civic leaders' requirements that can accelerate the community input analysis process and help them to gain actionable insights to make better decisions. Our interviews conducted with 14 civic leaders revealed a dichotomous nature of requirements based on their roles and analysis practices. The interviews also revealed the civic leaders' desire to understand the community's opinions beyond sentiments and how text analysis and visualization can bring structure and enable sensemaking of community input. This study is our first step towards exploring the design of community input analysis technologies for civic leaders that can contribute to democratic decision-making in digital civics.},

abstract = {Recommending fashion outfits requires learning a concept of style and fashionability that is typically human. There has been an increasing research effort into creating Machine Learning models able to learn such concepts, in order to distinguish between compatible and incompatible clothes and to select an item that would complete an outfit. However, most of the work done in literature tackles this problem from a pure Machine Learning point of view, disregarding real-case scenarios and the human interaction with systems able to generate outfits. This work tries to move the problem of generating outfits to the Recommender Systems domain by presenting as its main contribution a novel algorithm for a fashion-specific Recommender System that generates fashionable outfits, able to scale its inference time to be useful in real use case scenarios, and applies such algorithm on public and industrial datasets. In addition to this, this work shows preliminary results on how this algorithm can be employed in a real scenario and reports as preliminary results the evaluations provided by three professional stylists on the outfits generated by such algorithms.},

Since businesses are currently becoming multinational rather than relying solely on one location, it is quite important for global enterprises to localize their content of brand pages to maximize their effect in each country. To appropriately localize online content, it is necessary to understand, in each country, what kind of information do the enterprise have to post and what do the consumers post to the brand page. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to provide findings that the brand page designer can exploit. We show distinct categories of content of brand page posts and user comments that delineate characteristics of country from results of quantitative and qualitative analysis of entities extracted from the existing brand pages on Facebook in various countries.

abstract = {A musician performing on a digital musical instrument is modeled as a feed-forward communications channel. A variety of statements are made on the mutual information of the signals flowing through the model. For example, data processing can only reduce or retain mutual information, not increase it.It is suggested that instrument designers should consider creating high-fidelity musical instruments that generally avoid discarding information. Noise and many-to-one mappings have a tendency to decrease the mutual information, potentially reducing the fidelity of a digital musical instrument. Also, musicians need to rehearse their performances in order to avoid making noisier gestures.Overall, it is hoped that this paper and other related papers by the authors can show how to quantify information processing in user interfaces for continuous control.},

abstract = {This paper presents findings from an ongoing investigation into the public understanding of augmented reality (AR) technologies. Despite AR technologies becoming increasingly available to the general public, perceptions of its use and capabilities still vary based on a number of factors. To explore this concept, a survey was conducted into individual's definition of AR and classification of AR and traditional technologies. The themes elicited from responses indicated that digital and real components were both perceived as key characteristics, but the synthesis of these components was not significant. Responses also indicated that the public is still relatively unfamiliar with AR technologies, but familiarity does lend itself to a better understanding of what is or isn't AR. Trends in public perceptions of AR are presented, but also identify the need for more investigation into the public understanding of AR technologies.},

We conducted a study to understand how families use group chat and what challenges they face. We found family members develop certain habits in using their family group chat, and their behavior changes when they are separated by distance or during a specific situation such as a conflict. Family members might have challenges to construct meaning from a pile of messages, find a specific message from the past and catch up with the new messages posted in the group. They need more control over when they wish to deliver a message and better ways to share their experiences.},

The model combines the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a Ternary-Gaussian model to describe the impacts of target shape and target motion on selection endpoints of moving targets. Compared to the-state-of-the-art, our model achieved higher performance in the fitting of endpoint distribution and predicting selection error rate.},

Essential in facilitating effective human-AI collaboration is the explainability of AI system outputs (XAI). This late-breaking work presents an ongoing industrial research project aimed at designing, building, and implementing an XAI system for humanitarian aid planning. We draw on empirical data from our project and define current and future scenarios of use, adopting a scenario-based XAI design approach. These scenarios surface three central themes which shape human-AI collaboration in humanitarian aid planning: (1) Surfacing Causality, (2) Multifaceted Trust &amp; Lack of Data Quality, (3) Balancing Risky Situations. We explore each theme and in doing so, further our understanding of how humanitarian aid planners can partner with AI systems to better support forcibly displaced peoples.},

This one-day diary study with 20 academics compared the tasks people aimed to achieve in the morning with what they actually did during the day. Results showed that participants were good at estimating the duration of time-constrained tasks, such as meetings, however they were biased when estimating the time they would spend on less time-constrained tasks. Particularly, the time needed for email and coding tasks was underestimated, whereas the time needed for writing research and planning activities was overestimated. The findings extend previous research by measuring in situ whether some tasks are more prone to time estimation errors than others. Planning and scheduling (AI) tools could incorporate this knowledge to help people overcome these time estimation biases in their work.},

A song was added to the playlist with an unanimous positive decision only. After seeing the other group members' ratings, participants had the opportunity to revise their own response. Results suggest different behavior for originally favored compared to disliked songs. For favored songs, one negative judgement by another group member was sufficient to induce participants to downvote the song. For disliked songs, in contrast, a majority of positive judgements was needed to induce participants to switch their vote.},

Existing studies detect and quantify biases based on pre-defined attributes. However, in real practices, it is difficult to gather a comprehensive list of sensitive concepts for various categories of biases. We propose a general methodology to quantify dataset biases by measuring the difference of its data distribution with a reference dataset using Maximum Mean Discrepancy. For the case of natural language data, we show that lexicon-based features quantify explicit stereotypes, while deep learning-based features further capture implicit stereotypes represented by complex semantics. Our method provides a more flexible way to detect potential biases.},

Indeed, eight in ten of our participants believed their favorite font would be their best. Instead, our findings showed that the preferred font was seldom best, and one font did not fit all. Adult readers in our study read better with varying fonts. An average 117 word per minute difference between worst and best typeface, or around 10 additional pages an hour, means font choice is of real-world significance. Our discussion focuses on the challenges of rapidly identifying an individual's optimal font, and the exciting individuation technologies such an advance allows.},

Results suggest the existence of what we call the punishment gap that refers to the public's demand to punish automated agents upon a legal offense, even though their punishment is currently not feasible. Participants were also negative in granting assets or physical independence to electronic agents, which are crucial liability requirements. We discuss possible solutions to this punishment gap and present how legal systems might handle this contradiction while maintaining existing legal persons liable for the actions of automated agents.},

Scenarios covered apps that require disclosure of different types of sensitive information (shopping, dating, health), with gaming as a baseline. Users preferred markets that were easy to use and had a wide choice of apps. Only nine users highlighted security as a feature. Despite this, they primarily used only one app market - the pre-installed one. App-market specific features were important for the game scenario, but less important for all others. We suggest that download decisions for most apps are made before users enter an app market, and discuss implications for presenting privacy and security information.},

However, they face enormous challenges while transitioning to the US due to cultural shock, language barriers, and intense academic pressure. These issues can cause poor mental health, and in some cases, increased risk of self-harm. The relative ease of access and ubiquity of social technology have the potential for supporting IGS during socio-cultural transitions. However, little is known about how IGS use social technology for seeking support. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with the IGS in Western Massachusetts to understand how they seek social support. Our preliminary findings indicate that our participants preferred seeking informational and network support through social technology. They expressed that they preferred to seek emotional support in-person and from their close contacts but we found a latent pattern that shows they use technology passively (e.g, following others posts, comments, etc). We also found that over time, their support-seeking preference changes from people of similar ethnicity to people with similar experiences. Finally, we identified language as the primary barrier to actively seek any kind of support through technology.},

In this study, we test three hypotheses on the social correlates of user innovated bot usage drawn from a previous qualitative study. We find strong evidence of the proposed relationship between community size and the use of user innovated bots. Although previous work suggests that smaller teams of moderators will be more likely to use these bots and that users with experience moderating in the previous platform will be more likely to do so, we find little evidence in support of either proposition.},

Given teenagers' growing reluctance toward face-to-face communication, using a counseling chatbot could be a more effective way to provide teenage victims with necessary information and emotional support. There is a small number of counseling chatbots for victims of sexual crime, but none targeting teenagers specifically. This research suggests design guidelines for building a counseling chatbot for teenage victims of online sexual exploitation with a focus on establishing rapport by empathizing with their stories and providing them with the proper information. We conducted in-depth interviews with peer counselors at the Teenage Women's Human Rights Center, who have been consulting teenage victims in their age group using online messengers. The four key findings from our research suggested using open-ended questions, using teenager-friendly language, helping teenagers understand that they are victims and offering age-relevant information.},

Thus, conversational agents (CAs) have been in the spotlight as a counselor since they are easily-accessible and nonjudgmental unlike humans. Despite the optimistic view, it is still important to look at what burden victims have when trying to converse with a machine. Thus, this paper aims to identify victims' burdens of human-police (HPI) vs. human-chatbot interaction (HCI). We conducted interviews with ten sex crime professionals (eight police officers and two counselors). As a result, we discovered seven burdens that can occur both in HPI and HCI.

abstract = {Social media addiction concerns have increased steadily over the past decade. Digital nudges have previously been shown to hold enormous potential to change behavior. However, it is not clear how they might be designed to combat social media addiction. In this late-breaking work, we aim at clarifying this issue by investigating how digital nudges can reduce the addictive features of social media and other addictive sites. More precisely, we present the design of NUDGE, a novel browser extension that aims to make social media less addictive by delivering digital nudges founded on behavioral science. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of NUDGE with 67 actual users and 14 university students. Our results show that NUDGE (1) helped users to become reflective of their social media usage, (2) possibly decreased their time spent, and (3) made the experience more pleasant.},

abstract = {Service robots have yet to occupy niches in domestic environments beyond vacuuming and lawn mowing. This can only happen by providing an alternative experience rather than mimicking and competing with humans, pets and already available appliances. We argue that the robot's hybrid nature on a spectrum between 'thing' and 'being' is a suitable framework to create such a unique experience. More specifically, we argue that hybridity creates ambiguity which affords a wider range of practices to occur, from tool use to social interaction. We evaluate this idea in an online study with 61 participants who rated three robots with rather biomorphic (Pepper), hybrid (Sympartner) or device-like (Relay) appearance. Results show that the hybrid design affords a broader spectrum of use compared to designs inscribing to treat the robot as either possession or social companion. The study offers initial insights on ambiguity-through-hybridity as design strategy to help robots become domestic products.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a pilot study in which we adapted and tested the System Usability Scales (SUS) for children between ages of 7-11. We began the study with interviews with four elementary school teachers in which we asked their help with modifying the SUS usability statements for children. We then tested those questionnaire statements with 30 children after they completed puzzles in mobile apps; we assessed the statements' understandability, dimensionality, construct validity and reliability. Our adapted SUS statements were mostly understandable. A Principal Component Analysis resulted in a four-Component model; two of those components were established as reliable. However, we were only able to support construct validity for four questionnaire statements (and none of the four Components). This pilot study contributes to the knowledgebase of user testing with children.},

abstract = {Audio is one modality that besides content transmission offers non-verbal cues that influence emotional perception. This allows to increase trust for example in privacy-sensitive systems like digital assistants. In this work we focus on basic audio feedback and explore how parameters like melody, pitch or tempo influence the creation of trust. We refer to related research in trust perception of voice, and evaluate if the derived concepts can be universally applied to simple sound patterns. Our study (n=39) shows significant effects for melody and mode, while tendencies were found for pitch and individual user preferences. We consider our findings to serve as basis for research towards the design of unobtrusive and trustworthy user experiences.},
