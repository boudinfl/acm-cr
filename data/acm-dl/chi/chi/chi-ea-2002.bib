abstract = {Users working with documents that are too large and detailed to fit the user's screen (e.g. chip designs) have the choice of zooming or applying appropriate visualization techniques. In this demonstration, we will present focus plus context screens-wall-size low-resolution displays with an embedded high-resolution display region. They allow users to view details of a document up close, while simultaneously seeing peripheral parts of the document in lower resolution. Unlike overview plus detail, focus plus context screens do not require users to visually switch between multiple views. Unlike fisheye views, focus plus context screens do not introduce distortion.},

abstract = {Maintenance of complex machinery such as aircraft engines requires reliable and accurate documentation, including illustrated parts catalogs (IPCs), exploded views, and technical manuals describing how to remove, inspect, repair and install parts. For new designs, there are often time constraints for getting a new engine to the field, and the available documentation must go with it. Authoring technical manuals is a complex process involving technical writers, engineers, as well as domain experts (mechanics and designers). Often, several revisions are required before a manual has correct IPC figures and maintenance instructions. Compounding this problem is that technical writers often perform tasks better suited for computers, leading to increased costs and error.In this demonstration, we describe a new framework to generate maintenance instructions from solid models (Computer Aided Design/CAD data) and then validate these instructions in a haptics-enabled virtual environment. Our approach utilizes natural language processing techniques to generate a presentation-independent logical form, which can be transformed for display within the virtual environment. During the development of the system, task analyses, human models, usability studies, and domain experts were used to gain insights. The end result is a more integrated and human-centered process for developing technical manuals, providing higher quality documents with less cost.},

PetShop stands apart from most formal-based tools since it supports and promotes an iterative and user-centered design process, and also stands apart from most model-based tools since it goes beyond WIMP interfaces and does not sacrifice the formal validation of models.},

South African students (both novices and experienced web users) completed a series of visual exercises, where they interpreted a set of interface and conceptual conventions in common use on the web. Conceptual questions attempted to address to what extent students were familiar with and able to reproduce the conventional Western visual design resources for representing classificational taxonomies or 'tree structures' and various other visual devices for the implicit portrayal of hierarchical information structures (Kress and van Leeuwen 1996). Interface questions probed student recognition of common web icons. Some broadly cultural factors were found to explain at least some of the variation in the group. Finally, we consider the implications of our study for training, design, and the diverse range of South African representational resources.},

Our long-term research agenda is to build capture services for distributed workgroups that provide appropriate motivation and to further understand how access of captured meetings impacts work practices.

However, most CMC systems focus only on organizing the content of discussions. On the other hand, the social visualization research has developed techniques to depict human behaviors during a process of CMC but has not been integrated in any organizational memory system yet. In addition, the impacts of the graphical representations created by social visualization techniques have seldom been studied. The dissertation thus proposes a two-phase research to address those issues. The first phase proposes a prototype system that integrates a social visualization technique with various information analysis technologies to graphically summarize both the content and behavior of a CMC process. The second phase proposes to adopt the "de-featuring" approach used by previous interface evaluation studies to evaluate how the graphical interface developed affects users' information acquisition and evaluation process.},

It provides virtual shared drawers that connect family members who are located at a distance. When a user puts something in the upper drawer and closes it, a photograph is taken automatically and the image appears in the lower drawer at a distant place. The operation is as simple as using a drawer, allowing even children to communicate with their grandparents. As the camera only takes pictures of objects inside the drawer, privacy is assured.},

The new technique uses a single calibrated camera, several light sources with known positions and a physical model of the eye to estimate the 3D position of the eye and its gaze direction. Simulation results using ray tracing are used to study the accuracy and robustness of the system, and demonstrate its operability.},

For these users, it would be useful if messages of greater urgency can be played first.

We combine the quantitative glucose measurements with qualitative portraits of action into unified data visualizations. In doing so, we hope to make the relationship between physiology and behavior an object for discussion and reflection.

Our research shows, that offering rich contextual information can support the navigational task by providing the user with a feeling of familiarity and perceived credibility. At the same time it can be a source of distraction, and cause misinterpretations.

abstract = {This paper reports on experimental research that compares two interfaces in software designed for foreign language reading: one with visible and one with invisible links. The links lead to dictionary definitions and translations. The study focussed on differences in consulting behaviour, learning outcomes (vocabulary and comprehension) and on a possible interaction effect of condition and task. The results indicate that the two interfaces mainly differ in the users' willingness to consult the additional information. Differences in learning outcomes and a combined effect of condition and task could not be established.},

To ensure an identical driving workload for each test subject, it becomes necessary to individually adapt the degree of difficulty (DOD) of the driving task. We present a new technique in which, concerning the driving performance, each test participant is pre-classified in a baseline investigation before the main trial.

In this paper, we describe our approach of using a Task Model in conjunction with the User Interface Markup Language (UIML) to drive generation of Multi-Platform User Interfaces. We also discuss briefly how current usability engineering practices have to be modified to accommodate the development of multi-platform UIs.},

abstract = {Digital video is becoming more ubiquitous. Unfortunately, editing videos remains difficult for several reasons. It has dual tracks of audio and video and may require working at the smallest level of detail. Silver is an authoring tool that uses video metadata to overcome these problems. It provides mulitiple views with different content types and at different levels of abstraction. This paper focuses on Silver's smart selection and editing operations, which work at a high semantic level and handle different boundaries in audio and video. Our research suggests several ways in which video editing tools can assist users in the composition and reuse of video.},

Service industries have different requirements for communicating with customers, specifically regarding their product offerings. This is prominent in the air travel industy, where Web site usability is known to be poor. We examine how the current guidelines are inadequate for Web sites providing air travel information.

Concerns about such problems are valid; however, they do not explain why the use of speech is so controversial in the HCI community.

Callers and receivers have a need to discretely handle phone communication in delicate social situations. Early cell phone usage observations led to an interaction model hypothesis. A functional prototype was created to test the concept in the field. Preliminary results indicate that both calling and receiving users want more responsibility and control when placing phone calls, and that two remotely-mediated options, "hold" and "meeting," were enough to fill this communication need in the majority of situations.},

In these connections, reduced spatial and temporal video quality may affect the ability to detect whether others are lying or telling the truth. In the current study we examined the effects of varying levels of temporal and spacial distortion on lie detection performance. Consistent with earlier work, we found that a slight distortion of video signal impaired lie detection performance. Surprisingly, performance improved when the video was severely spatially degraded.},

Monitors and camera zooms make people look close or far, monitors and camera angles can be high or low making people look tall or short, volume can be loud or soft, making people sound assertive or submissive, --all independent of the true physical characteristics or intentions of the participants. Here we test the apparent height of a person on how dominant they are in a group decision-making task. We found that the artificially tall people had more influence in the group decision than the artifically short people.},

This koan has long served as an aid to meditation but it also describes our new interaction techinique. We discovered that gentle fingertip gestures such as tapping, rubbing, and flicking make quiet sounds that travel by bone conduction throughout the hand. A small wristband-mounted contact microphone can reliably and inexpensively sense these sounds. We harnessed this "sound in the hand" phenomenon to build a wristband-mounted bio-acoustic fingertip gesture interface. The bio-acoustic interface recognizes some common gestures that state-of-the-art glove and image-processing techniques capture but in a smaller, mobile package.},

This system requires only simple hardware, needs no special adaptation of the glass pane, and allows all transducers to be mounted on the inner surface, hence it is quite easy to deploy as a retrofit to existing windows. This opens many applications, such as an interactive storefront, with projected content controlled by knocks on the display window.},

abstract = {In a laboratory experiment on multiscale pointing, we compared one-handed vs. two-handed input for two zoom-control devices, a wheel vs. a mini-joystick with an all or none response. Using a recent method of quantifying multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) input coordination to evaluate pan-zoom parallelism, we confirm previous work [1] showing that multiscale pointing performance strongly depends on the degree of pan-zoom parallelism. The new finding is that two-handed input and a constant zoom speed allow more input parallelism, thereby increasing performance speed.},

Pet Pals is a game of trading that globally monitors who is participating in real-time by tracking the exchange of objects and dynamically altering each object's value to encourage those not participating to interact with each other, in part by making their objects more valuable to others.

abstract = {Flow visualization in 3D is challenging due to perceptual problems such as occlusion, lack of directional cues, lack of depth cues, and visual complexity. In this paper we present an interaction technique that addresses these special problems for 3D flow visualization. The feature we present, a streamrunner, games the user interactive control over the evolution of streamlines from the time they are seeds until they reach their full length. The interactive streamrunner control minimizes occlusion and visual complexity and maximizes directional and depth cues for 3D flow visualization tools, the streamrunner gives a brand new level of control to the user investigating the vector field.},

In this paper, we show that kinesthetic cues, or the awareness of parts of our body's position with respect to itself or to the environment, are useful for recalling the positions of objects in space. We report a user study demonstrating a 19% increase in spatial memory for information controlled with a touchscreen, which provides direct kinesthetic cues, as compared to a standard mouse interface. We also report results indicating that females may benefit more than males from using the touchscreen device.},

Another is that a WebQuest, if done correctly, takes advantage of more learning styles. We observed aural, kinesthetic, and visual learning styles, for example. The third advantage is that, since WebQuests are team projects, students learn to work in teams.},

Fourteen agents from a population of 150 were used to obtain similarity judgements, preference data, dimensional analysis, and personality judgements. Multidimensional Scaling analysis suggested that computer agents were categorized according to 2 main dimensions (gender and anthropomorphism). The clustering of agents were across dimensions predicted attributions made, with more positive attrbutions made to female agents, less positive to cartoon agents, and the most negative responses to male agents.},

There are two contributing factors in the formation of where a person is looking at : head orientation and eye orientation. In this poster, we present an experiment aimed at evaluating the potential of head orientation estimation in detecting who is looking at whom, because head orientation can be estimated accurately and robustly with non-intrusive methods while eye orientation can not. Experimental results show that head orientation contributes 68.9% on average to the overall gaze direction, and focus of attention estimation based on head orientation alone can get an average accuracy of 88.7% in a meeting application scenario with four participants. We conclude that head orientation is a good indicator of focus of attention in human computer interaction applications.},

We have found, as other researchers have, that users often have good reason to want to work with physical media. Yet they would still like to collaborate with each other. A fundamental tension exists in the design of systems to support remote collaboration when the interaction primitives are physical: physical objects live in one place. We have designed and implemented a remote collaboration system where users can still use physical objects. We introduce an interaction paradigm where objects that are physical in one space are electronic in the other space, and vice versa. Our distributed system is designed for two groups, with multiple users at each end. Our tangible approach is the first system to enable simultaneous, multi-input across locations. We have implemented this system as an extension to the Designers' Outpost[5].},

abstract = {The adoption of user experience methods within companies has followed a similar evolution over the past two decades. Typically organizations originally institute formative lab-based evaluations, and then add field studies and other user experience methods to their repertoire. This evolution typically occurs because the organization recognizes the need for more data on customer profiles, feature requirements, and task flows, along with the ability to iterate quickly among various design ideas and directions. These methods that fall outside of the categories of formative usability evaluations and field studies are addressed in this paper. Although there are a wide variety of methods within this 'alternative' category, a few representative samples will be discussed in more detail here. In actuality, these methods are not 'alternatives,' rather, they are additions to the toolkit of user experience methods that should be used in conjunction with formative usability studies and field studies.},

abstract = {Applications involving the measurement of human physiological responses to environment are becoming increasingly popular in HCI. This is due in part to the increasing availability of low-cost, high-specification sensing technologies. Areas such HCI evaluation, affective computing and biofeedback-based brain-computer interaction are all benefiting from the rich data source physiological sensing technologies make available. However, guidelines on the gathering and analysis of these measurements are virtually non-existent, which makes it difficult for new researchers to practise in this area. This timely workshop will bring together both practising and potential researchers using this method to gather knowledge on the techniques, technologies and applications of physiological computing.},
