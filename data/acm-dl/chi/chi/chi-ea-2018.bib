abstract = {Mobile phones are the ubiquitous platform used by billions of people globally, every day. However, two concerns signal a pause for reflection and change. First, while mobiles have rapidly become indispensable, the effect that constant device use has on our lives, our experiences, and the interactions we have with others, has caused growing discomfort [4, 7]. At the same time, there is a broad sense that mainstream mobile devices have fallen into a period of innovation limbo, with recent releases seemingly being distinguished only by ever narrowing feature gaps. As a recent Economist article bleakly reports, "More black rectangles made their debut" [2].This course will challenge attendees to play a part in reinvigorating mobile interaction design. We celebrate the success that is apps, services, and the hugely popular ecology of mobile devices, but want to promote a return to radical innovation.We have been fortunate enough to have collaborated with a broad range of industrial and academic researchers and practitioners over many years. More importantly, however, we have worked with a wide range of people who are not considered to be typical "future makers," and are also not usually considered when designing mobile user experiences. Typically these people - who have been called "emergent" users [1] - are often drawn from developing regions, with lower literacy, lower socioeconomic conditions, and other constraints. Our experience in working with these people has demonstrated how their unique and contrasting outlooks on both technology and the world and ways of seeing it are invaluable in generating radically new and exciting digital innovations.},

We will closely look into the basics of navigation, unravelling the psychophysics (including wayfinding) and actual locomotion (travel) aspects. The theoretical foundations form the basis for the practical skillset we will develop, by providing an in-depth discussion of navigation devices and techniques, and a step-by-step discussion of multiple real-world case studies. Doing so, we will cover the full range of navigation techniques from handheld to full-body, highly engaging and partly unconventional methods and tackle spatial navigation with hands-on-experience and tips for design and validation of novel interfaces. In particular, we will be looking at affordable setups and ways to "trick" out users to enable a realistic feeling of self-motion in the explored environments. As such, the course unites the theory and practice of spatial navigation, serving as entry point to understand and improve upon currently existing methods for the application domain at hand.},

abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness. The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

abstract = {Due to the enormous amount of information being carried over online systems today, no user can access all such information. Therefore, to help the users, all major online organizations deploy information retrieval (content recommendation, search or ranking) systems to find important information. Current information retrieval systems have to make certain design choices. For example, news recommendation systems need to decide on the quality of recommended news stories, how much emphasis to give to a story's long-term importance over its recency or freshness etc. Similarly, recommendation systems over user generated contents (e.g., in social media like Facebook and Twitter) need to take into account the content posted by heterogeneous user groups. However, such design choices can introduce unintended biases in the contents presented to the users. For example, the recommended contents may have poor quality or less news value, or the news discourse may get hijacked by hyper-active demographic groups. In this thesis, we want to systematically measure the effect of such design choices in the content recommendation systems, and build alternate recommendation systems that mitigate the biases in the recommendation output.},

We are interested in how such forms of interaction can be applied to mobile telepresence, i.e., a quick and effortless way of "teleporting" users to a remote location, where they can share each others' viewpoints and collaborate. We developed an application that achieves such effect by taking advantage of spatial data inferred from mobile devices' onboard sensors and embeds realtime video streams into panoramic mixed reality displays. To validate our solution we conducted a preliminary study and observed a statistically significant decrease in cognitive workload as well as increase in spatial and situational awareness among users in comparison with a regular videoconferencing application. Believing in the novelty of our approach, we plan to extend our application with environment mapping and empathic interface functionality.},

Using three case studies, focused on different locations and type of hazards, I show how current information systems and technologies reproduce and reinforce long-standing discourses that have been widely shown to be problematic by social science research on disaster. Inspired by research in the area of feminist studies of technoscience, disaster STS and HCI research into critical and participatory design, I explore novel approaches to making sense of flood hazard, earthquake damage, and sea-level rise that seek provide new ways of engaging with the complexities and uncertainties that characterize the Anthropocene.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of mobile technologies has led communities to engage with environmental and political concerns through collecting, representing, and analysing data. Activist engagement through data collection aims to hold businesses and the state to account--positioning itself against big data and proprietary technologies that foreclose on agency. Design scholars have unique insight to bring as society addresses the ethical and social issues emerging from data-driven technologies and their development. In my dissertation I focus on the design of civic technologies for environmental accountability--map platforms, mapping techniques, and ambient sensor networks for documenting pollution. By adopting an action research framework to investigate these projects, my research examines how critically-informed, participatory practices intervene to build more sustainable and equitable socio-technical systems, contributing an understanding of how these practices can be applied in new contexts.},

While these platforms contain terabytes of data about road networks and points of interest (POIs), their information about physical accessibility is commensurately poor. Moreover, because of their highly graphical nature and reliance on gesture and mouse input, digital maps can be inaccessible to some user groups (e.g., those with visual or motor impairments). While there is active HCI work towards addressing both concerns, to our knowledge, there has been no direct effort to unite this research community. The goal of this SIG is threefold: first, to bring together and network scholars and practitioners who are broadly working in the area of accessible maps; second, to identify grand challenges and open problems; third, to help better establish accessible maps as a valuable topic with important HCI-related research problems.},

abstract = {Chatbots are emerging as an increasingly important area for the HCI community, as they provide a novel means for users to interact with service providers. Due to their conversational character, chatbots are potentially effective tools for engaging with customers, and are often developed with commercial interests at the core. However, chatbots also represent opportunities for positive social impact. Chatbots can make needed services more accessible, available, and affordable. They can strengthen users' autonomy, competence, and (possibly counter-intuitively) social relatedness. In this SIG we address the possible social benefits of chatbots and conversational user interfaces. We will bring together the existing, but disparate, community of researchers and practitioners within the CHI community and broader fields who have an interest in chatbots. We aim to discuss the potential for chatbots to move beyond their assumed role as channels for commercial service providers, explore how they may be used for social good, and how the HCI community may contribute to realize this.},

SketCHI aims to address both research interests and sketching practice in a combined approach to define, discuss and deliver theory and methods to a broad audience. As well as structuring high level discussions and collating information and resources, this SIG will allow attendees to practice and explore observational sketching on location around the conference, with feedback and encouragement from industry professionals.

Previous workshop meetings found "engagement" to be a constructive and extendable notion through which to investigate synergized human-computer relationships, but many aspects concerning the core concept remain underexplored. This SIG aims to tackle the notion of engagement considered through discussions of four thematic threads. It will bring together HCI practitioners and researchers from different disciplines including Humanities, Design, Positive Psychology, Communication and Media Studies, Neuroscience, Philosophy and Eastern Studies, to share and discuss relevant knowledge and insights and identify new research opportunities and future directions.},

abstract = {Increasing the number of women and other underrepresented groups is a long-standing problem in high tech. Huge investments are being made to grow enrollments in college STEM programs, change hiring practices, and tackle workplace issues. But representations haven't changed. Since 2005 the percentage of women remains stagnant at 22%. Moreover, 50% of the women leave the field. To address workplace issues and improve retention, companies use interventions like mentorship, bias training, and flexwork. We think there's an opportunity to use technology to create interventions that are more effective than traditional corporate programs. This SIG harnesses our community's creativity and challenges us to think through ways to use technology to support diversity and retention. To provide empirical data for design, the organizers will share their findings from a worldwide survey of women and men that reveal the underlying reasons for low retention. Participants will then brainstorm and sketch technology solutions.},

How can we build UIs to leverage other senses besides vision and hearing such as tactility, olfaction and gustation? Second, how can we detect, capture and compute people's behavioral signals in a natural way and provide output accordingly? What are the current available technologies to achieve NUIs, and what new technologies should be invented to achieve it?},

In Code Maker, we created a system with an RFID antenna array on a robotic fire truck. The array senses RFID-embedded tiles as they are placed on the truck. Each tile corresponds to a command that is executed by the truck, directing to move, light up, and make sounds. In Story Maker, RFID antennas are embedded in toys that are placed on a mat, underlain with a two-dimensional array of RFID tags. The toys report their position on the mat, which triggers a scene in the story that corresponds to the configuration of toys. We describe the advantages of these RFID implementations as an alternative to other approaches, such as resistive sensing and hardware connectors.},

They can rigidly lock controllers in an arbitrary configuration, constrain specific degrees of freedom or directions of motion, and dynamically set stiffness along a continuous range. We demonstrate and compare three prototype Haptic Links: Chain, Layer-Hinge, and Ratchet-Hinge. We then describe interaction techniques and scenarios leveraging the capabilities of each. Our user evaluation results confirm that users can perceive many two-handed objects or interactions as more realistic with Haptic Links than with typical unlinked VR controllers.

However, reasoning dynamically about the results of a dimensionality reduction is difficult. Dimensionality-reduction algorithms use complex optimizations to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataset, but these new dimensions often lack a clear relation to the initial data dimensions, thus making them difficult to interpret. Here we propose a visual interaction framework to improve dimensionality-reduction based exploratory data analysis. We introduce two interaction techniques, forward projection and backward projection, for dynamically reasoning about dimensionally reduced data. We also contribute two visualization techniques, prolines and feasibility maps, to facilitate the effective use of the proposed interactions. We apply our framework to PCA and autoencoder-based dimensionality reductions. Through data-exploration examples, we demonstrate how our visual interactions can improve the use of dimensionality reduction in exploratory data analysis.},

abstract = {We present GridDrones, a self-levitating programmable matter platform that can be used for representing 2.5D 15 voxel grid relief maps with capabilities of rendering overhangs and 3D spatial transformations. GridDrones consists of 15 cube-shaped nanocopters that can be placed in a volumetric 1xnxn mid-air grid. Grid deformations can be applied interactively to this voxel lattice by first selecting a set of voxels using a 3D wand, then assigning a continuous topological relationship between voxel sets that determines how voxels move in relation to each other, then drawing out selected voxels from the lattice structure. Using this simple technique, it is possible to create overhanging structures that can be translated and oriented freely in 3D. Shape transformations can also be recorded to allow for simple physical shape morphing animations. This work extends previous work on selection and editing techniques for 3D user interfaces.},

However, current commercial and research-based solutions often lack a user-centered, symbiotic design approach covering the physical and virtual design level. Consequently, the player cannot experience a maximum attractive and effective individual as well as social user experience. To contribute to this topic, we present the adaptive exergame "Plunder Planet" for children and young adolescents, which can be played as single- and cooperative multiplayer with two different motion-based controllers demanding either haptic or gesture-based input movements. The fitness game environment was designed by an interdisciplinary team of sport scientists, game user researchers, game/industrial/interaction designers and children. So far, "Plunder Planet" was evaluated in various study settings, which proof the benefits of the holistic and interdisciplinary design approach.},

In doing so, we foreground contemporary HCI questions of ownership, curation, and presentation of self after a romantic breakup to the public.

A servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. Using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement.

To investigate this underexplored area, we conducted an extensive research through design process which includes a (1) participatory design workshop with 25 participants, (2) preliminary user tests with Wizard-of-Oz and experience prototypes with 15 participants, (3) production of a new game system, wearable and tangible artifacts and (4) summative user tests for understanding the effects on experience with 16 participants. As a result of our study, we extracted design guidelines about how to integrate wearables and movement in narrative-based tabletop games and communicate how the results of each phase affected our artifacts.},

Force feedback is generally categorized into passive and active force feedback. Passive force is produced passively and continuously against the body part movement, e.g., elasticity and resistance. Active force is triggered by events and rendered actively and discretely to stimulate users, e.g., recoil and impact. ElasticVR consists of an elastic band, servo motors and mechanical locks to provide both passive and active force feedback. By changing length and extension distance of the elastic band, different elasticity levels produce various force feedback levels. By observing multi-level force feedback perception, we provide 5-level passive and 3-level active force feedback on the finger. We expect that realistic force feedback from ElasticVR enhances VR experiences.},

To expand the information bandwidth, we considered combining multiple tactile stimuli that are perceptually distinct. As one form of multimodal tactile display, we demonstrate a wind-vibration tactile display. The display consists of two layers of 2 \texttimes{} 2 (4 points) tactile display. By stacking a vibration motor on the top of a fan, each point of the display can present vibration and small wind on the same area on the wrist independently. Based on the relationship of two tactile modalities, we categorized possible interaction scenarios into three pattern types: Individual, Simultaneous, and Sequential. We demonstrate the interaction scenarios to show the feasibility of multimodal tactile display.},

As part of the Empathy Mirror project [4], we explore using technology to instead invert the expressed physical aggression of one participant into a soothing massage for another. Participants take out their aggression on a punching bag. The system detects the magnitude of the blows, and processes them into vibrations rendered via a massage seat to a second participant. Participants reflect on how technology can subvert our intentions, such that the receiver's perception may be very different from what the sender originally communicated. In this case, the most aggressive action is to remove themselves from the exhibit, leaving the receiver with no positive vibes, effectively nullifying the ability to be hostile.},

abstract = {Longitudinal and large-scale studies have shown a strong link between spatial abilities and success in STEM learning and careers. However, many spatial learning materials are either still 2D-based, or not optimized to engage students. In addition, research in spatial cognition distinguishes many spatial abilities as independent from one another. This implies the need to design content and interactions that target individual spatial abilities in order to further research and support training. Following this approach, we describe the design and implementation for a VR system, "Keep the Ball Rolling", controlled with tangible inputs and played as a multi-level game. The system is designed around one central spatial ability: penetrative thinking, which is important in geology, biology, human anatomy, and dentistry among other areas.},

abstract = {We present a system that complements virtual reality experiences with passive props, yet still allows modifying the virtual world at runtime. The main contribution of our system is that it does not require any actuators; instead, our system employs the user to reconfigure and actuate otherwise passive props. We demonstrate a foldable prop that users reconfigure to represent a suitcase, a fuse cabinet, a railing, and a seat. A second prop, suspended from a long pendulum, not only stands in for inanimate objects, but also for objects that move and demonstrate proactive behavior, such as a group of flying droids that physically attack the user. Our approach conveys a sense of a living, animate world, when in reality the user is the only animate entity present in the system, complemented with only one or two physical props. In our study, participants rated their experience as more enjoyable and realistic than a corresponding no-haptics condition. },

abstract = {Paper-based fabrication techniques offer powerful opportunities to prototype new technological interfaces. Typically, paper-based interfaces are either static mockups or require integration with sensors to provide real-time interactivity. The latter can be challenging and expensive, requiring knowledge of electronics, programming, and sensing. But what if computer vision could be combined with prototyping domain-aware programming tools to support the rapid construction of interactive, paper-based tangible interfaces? We designed a toolkit called ARcadia that allows for rapid, low-cost prototyping of TUIs that only requires access to a webcam, a web browser, and paper. ARcadia brings paper prototypes to life through the use of marker based augmented reality (AR). Users create mappings between real-world tangible objects and different UI elements. After a crafting and programming phase, all subsequent interactions take place with the tangible objects. We evaluated ARcadia in a workshop with 120 teenage girls and found that tangible AR technologies can empower novice technology designers to rapidly construct and iterate on their ideas.},

The interactive tactile aid for tablets proposed in this paper brings together the existing learning preferences of older adults with a tangible and tactile interaction method. By delivering relevant information to the user at the time of need, TAGhelper aims to provide older adults with the means to familiarize themselves with their immediate environment when they become confused by an interface and its functions.},

We present ColorMod, a method to accomplish multi-color changes (e.g., red-to-yellow). We achieve this using a multi-color pattern with one color per voxel across the surface of the object. When recoloring the object, our system locally activates only those voxels that have the desired color and turns all other voxels off.},

Our unique approach of using the property of MR fluid creates a variety of ground material deformation such as snow, mud, and dry sand by changing its viscosity when the actuators are pressed by the user's foot. We build an interactive virtual reality application with four different virtual scenes to explore the design space of RealWalk.},

Rather than relying on platforms, we consider how harassment recipients can harness their personal community for support. We present Squadbox, a tool to help recipients of email harassment coordinate a "squad" of friend moderators to shield and support them during attacks. Moderators intercept email from strangers and can reject, organize, and redirect emails as well as collaborate on filters. Harassment recipients can highly customize the tool, choosing what messages go through, how moderators should handle particular messages, and if and how they receive rejected messages.},

Canetroller provides three types of feedback: (1) physical resistance generated by a wearable programmable brake mechanism that physically impedes the controller when the virtual cane comes in contact with a virtual object; (2) vibrotactile feedback that simulates the vibrations when a cane hits an object or touches and drags across various surfaces; and (3) spatial 3D auditory feedback simulating the sound of real-world cane interactions.

Implementing a virtual dollhouse in a computer screen offers a more attractive type of play because it removes restrictions on the movements of dolls and the settings of play. However, this method typically compromises the benefits of real doll play. By combining real doll play with a virtual dollhouse, it is possible to incorporate the advantages of both types of play. We develop a virtual dollhouse in a computer display that can be used with real doll play on a tabletop. To connect the real (tabletop) and the virtual (computer display) world, we created a device named "GetToyIn" for users to move their toys (dolls) in and out of the virtual dollhouse. Observations of children aged 4 to 10 years old playing with our dollhouse confirmed that they could understand and operate the design model.},

However, their inherent limitations have hampered wider adoption. 3D sketching using hand motion is rapid but rough, and 3D sketching using pen drawing is delicate but tedious. Our new 3D sketching workflow combines these two in a complementary manner. The user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3D shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3D sketching on a tablet device. Our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. Then, the user sketches 3D ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed. Our progressive and iterative workflow enables more agile 3D sketching compared to ones using either hand motion or pen drawing alone.},

abstract = {Creating whimsical, personal data visualizations remains a challenge due to a lack of tools that enable for creative visual expression while providing support to bind graphical content to data. Many data analysis and visualization creation tools target the quick generation of visual representations, but lack the functionality necessary for graphics design. Toolkits and charting libraries offer more expressive power, but require expert programming skills to achieve custom designs. In contrast, sketching affords fluid experimentation with visual shapes and layouts in a free-form manner, but requires one to manually draw every single data point. We aim to bridge the gap between these extremes. We propose DataInk, a system supports the creation of expressive data visualizations with rigorous direct manipulation via direct pen and touch input. Leveraging our commonly held skills, coupled with a novel graphical user interface, DataInk enables direct, fluid, and flexible authoring of creative data visualizations.},

In this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing.

For rapid prototyping, most applications only support visual design. For predictive modelling, tools such as CogTool generate performance predictions but do not represent touch actions natively and do not allow exploration of different usage contexts. To combine the benefits of rapid visual design tools with underlying predictive models, we developed the Storyboard Empirical Modelling tool (StEM) for exploring and predicting user performance with touch interfaces. StEM provides performance models for mainstream touch actions, based on a large corpus of realistic data. Our tool provides new capabilities for exploring and predicting touch performance, even in the early stages of design. This is the demonstration of our accompanying paper1.},

abstract = {This work presents the Dynamic Object Scanning (DO-Scanning), a novel interface that helps users browse long and untrimmed first-person videos quickly. The proposed interface offers users a small set of object cues generated automatically tailored to the context of a given video. Users choose which cue to highlight, and the interface in turn adaptively fast-forwards the video while keeping scenes with highlighted cues played at original speed. Our experimental results have revealed that the DO-Scanning has an efficient and compact set of cues arranged dynamically and this set of cues is useful for browsing a diverse set of first-person videos.},

abstract = {Eye movements contain a wealth of information about how we process visual information. However, typical visual representations of gaze only reflect a single feature such as the current fixation point. As eye tracking technology becomes more affordable and ubiquitous it is important to consider the entire design space for visualizing eye movements. The Iris system allows users to quickly design visualizations to represent gaze patterns in real time. The visualization can be manipulated to represent different features of gaze including current fixation, duration, and saccades. Stylistic elements can also be adjusted such as color, opacity, and smoothness to give users creative and detailed control over the design of their gaze visualization.},

We built a prototype based on a 3D printed shell augmented with copper to detect the smartphone on the tablet screen. We also developed a simplified spreadsheet app on the tablet in which users can select cells using three stacking-based interaction techniques.},

abstract = {Youth who experience crisis often do not receive appropriate support and end up in emergency services. Stigma and lack of awareness of other forms of community supports are two primary reasons. An increase in using short-term psychotherapies combined with opportunities driven by technological advancements has led to the popularity of smartphone applications designed for mental health support especially among youth. This community-based project is a collaboration between students from George Brown College's Interaction Design and Development program (Toronto), youth in the Region of Peel, the Provincial System Support Program (PSSP) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), the Peel Service Collaborative (PSC) and CoDesign. It involves the creation of a digital platform that draws from existing community services and aids youth in anticipating and dealing with crisis. This three-year initiative has resulted in Mellow, a mobile application for youth. This paper describes the research and design process, challenges, early findings and prototype. It outlines the research methods and key findings about the problems youth face when experiencing crisis and the current approach to managing crisis. It explains the collaborative design methodology employed in the development and testing of the interactive, user-centered, crisis planning tool.},

The Spitalfields City Farm community offers a peaceful escape from busy city life and provides access to learning opportunities. To maintain its daily activities the farm depends on funding, yet due to insufficient feedback data funding opportunities are often missed. We present NaviiCompass, an interactive, handheld device (Figure 1). It enables the Spitalfields Farm community to collect feedback in a seamless, playful manner, while providing educational content to the community. The design was inspired by observations and semi-structured interviews with members of the Spitalfields farm community, revealing their struggle to acquire feedback from visitors. Portable smart compasses direct visitors to stations around the farm where they are asked to give feedback. NaviiCompass empowers the community by enabling them to access the funding they need to support the farm's activities.},

abstract = {Weather-related disasters have the potential to cause devastating impact on community infrastructure, families, and lives. The current state of hurricane relief can be broken down into pre-hurricane preparation and post-hurricane recovery. However, many problems exist in both stages of overall hurricane relief from both the citizen and government perspective; these problems range from the ambiguous information experience of storm preparation, to slow repair protocols for infrastructure damage. In this paper we propose Dawn, a local weather information tool that improves the process of information retrieval and city-wide recovery from hurricanes for citizens and local governments. Dawn targets some of the key problems found in primary and secondary research regarding hurricane preparation and relief. The design provides local government Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs) with a drone swarm weather monitoring system to assess infrastructure damage costs on a large scale, and citizens with hyperlocal weather information based on their specific locations.},

The problem is commonly ignored in Bryan/College Station, TX, mainly on the college campuses in the area. One Step was created to address this misconception and bridge the gap between people who are affected by poverty and those who are not.

With its ubiquitous role in keeping up with current affairs, social media could be used to retrospectively research historical events by treating posts as primary sources, as in History and Journalism. This paper proposes a metric system and interface design for allowing users to sort through Twitter posts. The aim is to allow users to judge social media source reliability and reconstruct details of a historical event. After participants used the sample tool, it was concluded that the framework is a beneficial starting point to formalise a computational process for sorting and visualising Twitter data based on reliability. The study also showed that the presence of URLs in Tweets (backing evidence) and the author's number of followers (reputability) were most important for discerning credibility. This project can inspire future work to integrate this framework into social media applications for data extraction, user feed generation and interface design when presenting posts to users.},

abstract = {Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and IoT have undoubtedly been the largest shapers of the 21st century, changing how people live, think and work. Though, many in the developed world and a few privileged in the developing world can attest to this. Due to illiteracy, socio-economic constraints and unavailability of many non-western languages especially African languages on these mobile devices; majority of the people in developing countries are yet to benefit from these mobile devices. Yet, the rise of powerful artificial intelligence and natural language processing present new opportunities for many users of mobile devices to easily interact with their devices in their own vernacular language. Thus, get the best out of their devices.This paper presents results collected through an online survey across 6 African countries to establish what African users think of existing voice assistants, such as Siri, Google assistant and alike. Additionally, provides recommendations based on our findings that will improve these voice assistants to better understand what Africans say. Therefore, improve the user experience of African users.},

No technological interventions exist to help these patients prioritize and manage the treatments of all their conditions simultaneously. In this paper, we use the barriers patients face and solutions they wish to utilize in managing their conditions and treatments to motivate the design of a mobile application that can be used to help patients successfully manage their conditions. This mobile application allows patients to better understand their conditions and treatments, successfully manage their medications and other treatments, stay connected with their medical and social support networks, and take steps to achieve goals related to their overall health and well-being.},

abstract = {This study examines how users interact with Google Home, which is a type of home virtual assistant (HVA). Users are expected to speak to HVAs in a conversational manner; however, there has been little research looking at users' mental models for what kinds of interactions they think the devices are capable of. To investigate users' mental models, I conducted user study sessions in which I gave novice users several tasks to complete, and asked them to think aloud as they completed those tasks. I elicited two mental models (push, pull) from verbal strategies they use to complete the task. My findings help to better understand why users may be reluctant to use HVAs, and provide design guidance for future conversational interfaces.},

abstract = {We suggest that the way motivational messages look like (their visual presentation, e.g., typefaces, colors) can influence individual's attitudes related to engaging in physical exercise, independently of whether they are mainly intrinsically or extrinsically motivated to exercise. In case individuals are mainly intrinsically motivated, positive affect from aesthetic pleasure should reinforce positive affective responses. If individuals are extrinsically motivated, the aesthetic pleasure alone should be rewarding and influence their cognitive responses. Moreover, regarding individuals who are extrinsically motivated, positive affect from aesthetic pleasure should strengthen the impact of aesthetic pleasure on individuals' attitudes since it should have a positive impact on the individuals' intrinsic motivation (increasing the feeling of joy or, in other words, impacting their affective responses). If our assumptions are verified, this could be particularly relevant to shape individual's attitudes related to physical activity since affective responses can better predict the intention of doing exercise.},

abstract = {In a social context where a real human interacts with a virtual human (VH) in the same space, one's sense of social/co-presence with the VH is an important factor for the quality of interaction and the VH's social influence to the human user in context. Although augmented reality (AR) enables the superposition of VHs in the real world, the resulting sense of social/co-presence is usually far lower than with a real human. In this paper, we introduce a research approach employing multimodal interactivity between the virtual environment and the physical world, where a VH and a human user are co-located, to improve the social/co-presence with the VH. A preliminary study suggests a promising effect on the sense of copresence with a VH when a subtle airflow from a real fan can blow a virtual paper and curtains next to the VH as a physical--virtual interactivity. Our approach can be generalized to support social/co-presence with any virtual contents in AR beyond the particular VH scenarios.},

In response, HCI research - as well as a rapidly growing commercial market for 'anti-distraction tools' - has begun to develop apps, browser plugins, and other tools that help users understand and regulate their use. The extensive literature on the mechanics of self-regulation from cognitive neuroscience and behavioural economics might help guide this work. However, so far the emerging HCI work has drawn on a very limited subset of self-regulatory models, in particular Social-Cognitive Theory. Here, we draw together main insights from a broader spectrum of basic research on the mechanics of self-regulation in a simple framework. We use the generated model to analyse interventions in a sample of 112 existing anti-distraction tools, and hope it may contribute a useful alternative view of the design space for UI features that support self-regulation.},

To explore this question, this project recruited 1) science journalism students, 2) professional science journalists and 3) a panel of scientists to research the bias of information transmitted between them via an HCI and CSCW approach. Journalists wrote articles on science controversies via a web application designed for argumentation. The articles produced were then evaluated by the panel of scientists for accuracy (i.e., number of errors) in a double-blind trial. Findings include: (1) Journalists reported the HCI and CSCW approach increased their comprehension of controversies (2) Scientists confirmed the articles produced via the HCI and CSCW approach as more accurate than those produced without the approach.},

abstract = {Modernizing the energy grid to a stable sustainable multi-directional energy generation, consumption and storage in the automated smart home context requires new forms of civic engagement. An interdisciplinary corpus of eco-feedback scholars have highlighted the potential for technologically mediated feedback to make people more aware and cognizant of their energy usage. But most commercial energy monitors draw on economic behavioral models that render residents as rational decision makers who seek to save money on their next energy bill. The more recent research in academia is grounded in social psychology suggesting that prospective energy conservationists are driven by social norms. These individualist perspectives have failed to address the potential of leveraging social behavioral theories to design technologically mediated feedback that enhances individuals' awareness of and willingness to cooperate with the wider digitally interconnected social collective. This research addresses this gap by testing how particular visual structures of feedback graphs increase collective awareness and cooperation in the home energy-monitoring context. Integrating socio-cognitive theories that explain how information cues affect motivations and goal-oriented behaviors with existing work in information visualization, this dissertation theoretically derives and empirically examines a set of visual design patterns for eco-feedback that may make individuals more collective and cooperative.},

We developed two typefaces to assess the quality of legibility for use on E-ink displays in an educational or business environment, using the typeface Arial as a standard. Legibility is measured in terms of how many correct words the subject reads aloud and the time taken to initially speak. Time is not used to assess reading speeds, but to establish difficulty in legibility. Three different font sizes are used to determine any lower bound thresholds on legibility that exist within the typeface. These methods allow for a font to be developed and used with E-ink displays for clear communication.},

These are short, goal-driven activities that opportunistically find participants based on their situational context and allow participants to connect with one another in a low-effort way. In order to create and run these experiences, we present a system called Cerebro, which automatically gathers and coordinates participation in experiences by detecting information about users' physical surroundings. In a preliminary study, we ran three different opportunistic collective experiences and found that they lead to interest in other participants, excitement in participating in unique locations, and increased awareness of one's surroundings.},

abstract = {These days, news regarding various events and accidents are reported quickly through internet and applications. Although most of the breaking news are accurate, the news of ongoing events may deliver the misinformation as the circumstances may change. Although the misinformation is corrected afterwards, people tend to be influenced continually by previous misinformation. Therefore, this study aims to find out what characteristics of news chatbot agent are effective in making correction message. The result shows that the silent news chatbot is more likely to lead people to be influenced by misinformation than news chatbot which also mentions a few words when they are required to give information.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite decades of research into developing abstract security advice and improving interfaces, users still struggle to make passwords. Users frequently create passwords that are predictable for attackers [1, 9] or make other decisions (e.g., reusing the same password across accounts) that harm their security [2, 8]. In this thesis,1 I use data-driven methods to better understand how users choose passwords and how attackers guess passwords. I then combine these insights into a better password-strength meter that provides real-time, data-driven feedback about the user's password. I first quantify the impact on password security and usability of showing users different password-strength meters that score passwords using basic heuristics. I find in a 2,931- participant online study that meters that score passwords stringently and present their strength estimates visually lead users to create stronger passwords without significantly impacting password memorability [6]. Second, to better understand how attackers guess passwords, I perform comprehensive experiments on password-cracking approaches. I find that simply running these approaches in their default configuration is insufficient, but considering multiple well-configured approaches in parallel can serve as a proxy for guessing by an expert in password forensics [9]. The third and fourth sections of this thesis delve further into how users choose passwords. Through a series of analyses, I pinpoint ways in which users structure semantically significant content in their passwords [7]. I also examine the relationship between users' perceptions of password security and passwords' actual security, finding that while users often correctly judge the security impact of individual password characteristics, wide variance in their understanding of attackers may lead users to judge predictable passwords as sufficiently strong [5]. Finally, I integrate these insights into an open-source2 password-strength meter that gives users data-driven feedback about their specific password. This meter uses neural networks [3] and numerous carefully combined heuristics to score passwords and generate data-driven text feedback about a given password. I evaluate this meter through a ten-participant laboratory study and 4,509-participant online study [4]. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we find that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback leads users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator. In sum, the objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how integrating data-driven insights about how users create and how attackers guess passwords into a tool that presents real-time feedback can help users make better passwords.},

abstract = {As an industry researcher in 1997, I dove head first into the world of privacy when I joined an international working group that was developing a web privacy standard called the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P). Released in 2002, the P3P standard allowed websites to communicate about privacy in a computer-readable format that could be consumed by web browsers and other user agents to inform users and take actions on their behalf. I worked with (and eventually led) a team of technologists, lawyers, and policy makers, and became familiar with not only technologies for protecting and invading privacy, but also international privacy laws and self-regulatory privacy programs. As the working group debated details such as the precise definitions of data sharing and identifiable information, I came to the realization that we hadn't thought much about how to make P3P tools usable. Indeed, usability issues had been largely ignored in the development of most security and privacy tools at that time. At the end of 2003, I moved on to academia and focused my research on usable privacy and security. Along with my students and colleagues, I conducted empirical studies to evaluate privacy and security tools, and recommended ways to make these tools more usable. We asked study participants to make privacy sensitive purchases (condoms and sex toys), and conducted some of the first Mechanical Turk studies related to privacy. Our research papers provided empirical evidence about how long it would take people if they actually did read privacy policies (too long!), that ad-industry-driven privacy efforts were largely ineffective, that privacy "nutrition labels" could help people compare company privacy practices, and that many people care enough about privacy to actually pay for it. We presented our research at events at the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and on Capitol Hill. In 2016 I spent a year in Washington, DC as Chief Technologist at the FTC. Besides advising the chairwoman and staff, I organized an FTC workshop to discuss methods for evaluating the effectiveness of privacy policies and other disclosures. After having my mobile phone account hijacked, I investigated this form of identity theft, and ended up discussing it on a Today Show segment taped in my kitchen. I also wrote blog posts that raised awareness about privacy concerns associated with open police data, and explained why frequent password changes may not be beneficial. In this talk I will discuss my usable privacy and security research and how it has informed policy work. I will highlight empirical studies that provide insights into users' expectations about privacy and security, as well as their use of privacy and security tools. Finally, I will talk about my experiences at the FTC and ways that members of the CHI community can impact public policy.},

abstract = {I'm an optimist. I entered our field believing that we can use technology to make people's lives better, and agreeing with Lincoln, Drucker, Kay and others that "The best way to predict your future is to create it." For HCI, as the technological tools we have available to design experiences have evolved, our impact has moved from its initial focus on human factors, fitting systems to users (efficiency and effectiveness), to 2nd wave considerations of people in community and the rich context of life, and delight and identity. Third wave HCI recognizes the growing ubiquity of a digital world as the new context that we shape and are shaped by, and its ability to touch every aspect of what it is to be human. It is the ecosystem of digital products that many of us are creating with maturing and diverse design perspectives that is enriching lives. There has certainly been a dark side of those left behind, unintended consequences and apparent failures of promising innovations. In this talk I will be reflecting on lessons learned through these waves of evolution in our field. I'll also be sharing what I believe are some of the properties of the wave that could come if we embrace the transformative power of the next generation of technology to address the toughest social issues we face by baking universal design into the fabric of the digital world.},

abstract = {Personal fabrication tools, such as 3D printers, are on the way of enabling a future in which non-technical users will be able to create custom objects. However, while the hardware is there, the current interaction model behind existing design tools is not suitable for non-technical users. Today, 3D printers are operated by fabricating the object in one go, which tends to take overnight due to the slow 3D printing technology. Consequently, the current interaction model requires users to think carefully before printing as every mistake may imply another overnight print. Planning every step ahead, however, is not feasible for non-technical users as they lack the experience to reason about the consequences of their design decisions. In this dissertation [2], we propose changing the interaction model around personal fabrication tools to better serve this user group. We draw inspiration from personal computing and argue that the evolution of personal fabrication may resemble the evolution of personal computing: Computing started with machines that executed a program in one go before returning the result to the user (Figure 1). By decreasing the interaction unit to single requests, turn-taking systems such as the command line evolved, which provided users with feedback after every input. Finally, with the introduction of direct-manipulation interfaces, users continuously interacted with a program receiving feedback about every action in real-time. In this dissertation, we explore whether these interaction concepts can be applied to personal fabrication as well.},

abstract = {I have long been interested in how computers can help people perform skilled tasks-a theme that underlies essentially all of my research. As the intentionally convoluted title of this talk implies, I will take a look back at some of this research to explain what came later, and to speculate on what might be next. My earliest work as a graduate student was as part of a team developing novel hypermedia editing and presentation tools for technical documentation of equipment maintenance procedures. Understanding the effort involved in using these tools manually led to my dissertation, which explored rule-based techniques for the automated generation of 3D graphics that could ultimately replace the pictures found in maintenance manuals. Based on information about the task to be depicted, I designed a system that chose the objects to include, determined the level of detail at which to render them (e.g., adding more detail to disambiguate objects that could otherwise be confused with each other), highlighted important objects for emphasis, and created additional "metaobjects" (e.g., arrows to show actions). When I started as a faculty member, several of my students built on this research direction in both 3D and 2D domains, and we were soon collaborating with colleagues to develop generation approaches for coordinated multimedia explanations that combined graphics with text. At the same time, I was becoming excited by the potential of virtual reality (VR) to render objects stereoscopically and interact with them in 3D, in abstract domains as well as physical ones. And it was an easy jump from there to augmented reality (AR), cobbling together a simple monoscopic optical seethrough head-worn display. Our first AR system was a "hybrid" desktop window manager that embedded windows displayed on a flat panel display within a much larger virtual surround presented on the AR display. With that AR display now available as a tool, it became stunningly clear that so much of the effort we'd put into carefully crafting stand-alone pictures to explain tasks was unnecessary. If the user could instead look directly at the actual task domain, then a simple highlight or arrow, overlaid in situ, could show which button to push or knob to turn on a panel of controls.},

abstract = {More HCI designs and devices are embracing what is being dubbed "body centric computing," where designs both deliberately engage the body as the locus of interest, whether to move the body into play or relaxation, or to track and monitor its performance, or to use it as a surface for interaction. Most HCI researchers are engaging in these designs, however, with little direct knowledge of how the body itself works either as a set of complex internal systems or as sets of internal and external systems that interact dynamically. The science of how our body interacts with the microbiome around us also increasingly demonstrates that our presumed boundaries between what is inside and outside us may be misleading if not considered harmful. Developing both (1) introductory knowledge and (2) design practice of how these in-bodied and circumbodied systems work with our understanding of the em-bodied self, and how this gnosis/praxis may lead to innovative new body-centric computing designs is the topic of this workshop.},

abstract = {The goal of this one-day workshop is to open space for disruptive techniques and strategies to be used in the making, prototyping, and conceptualizations of the artifacts and systems developed and imagined within HCI. Specifically, this workshop draws on strategies from art, speculative design, and activism, as we aim to productively "trouble" the design processes behind HCI. We frame these explorations as "disruptive improvisations" - tactics artists and designers use to make the familiar strange or creatively problematize in order to foster new insights. The workshop invites participants to inquire through making and take up key themes as starting points to develop disruptive improvisations for design. These include modesty, scarcity, uselessness, no-technology, and failure. The workshop will produce a zine workbook or pamphlet to be distributed during the conference to bring visibility to the role these tactics of making in a creative design practices.},

abstract = {Technology has become central to many activities of learning, ranging from its use in classroom education to work training, mastering a new hobby, or acquiring new skills of living. While digitally-enhanced learning tools can provide valuable access to information and personalised support, people with specific accessibility needs, such as low or no vision, can often be excluded from their use. This requires technology developers to build more inclusive designs and to offer learning experiences that can be shared by people with mixed-visual abilities. There is also scope to integrate DIY approaches and provide specialised teachers with the ability to design their own low cost educational tools, adapted to pedagogical objectives and to the variety of visual and cognitive abilities of their students. For researchers, this invites new challenges of how to best support technology adoption and its evaluation in often complex educational settings. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in accessibility and education to share best practices and lessons learnt for technology in this space; and to jointly discuss and develop future directions for the next generation design of inclusive and effective education technologies.},

abstract = {The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings abundant new opportunities to create more effective and pleasing tangible user interfaces that capitalize on intuitive interaction in the physical world, whilst utilizing capabilities of sensed data and Internet connectivity. However, with these new opportunities come new challenges; little is still known how to best design tangible IoT interfaces that simultaneously provide engaging user experiences and foster a sense of understanding about the often-complex functionality of IoT systems. How should we map previous taxonomies and design principles for tangible interaction into the new landscape of IoT systems? This workshop will bring together a community of researchers from the fields of IoT and tangible interaction, in order to explore and discuss how parallels between tangible interaction and the properties of IoT systems can best be capitalised on as HCI research moves increasingly toward the Internet of Tangible Things (IoTT). Through ideation and discussion, the workshop will function as a springboard for the community to begin creating new taxonomies and design considerations for the emerging IoTT.},

abstract = {Control interfaces and interactions based on touch-less gesture tracking devices have become a prevalent research topic in both industry and academia. Touch-less devices offer a unique interaction immediateness that makes them ideal for applications where direct contact with a physical controller is not desirable. On the other hand, these controllers inherently lack active or passive haptic feedback to inform users about the results of their interaction. Mid-air haptic interfaces, such as those using focused ultrasound waves, can close the feedback loop and provide new tools for the design of touch-less, un-instrumented control interactions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the growing mid-air haptic research community to identify and discuss future challenges in control interfaces and their application in AR/VR, automotive, music, robotics and teleoperation.},

State-of-the-art touch-based technologies have the potential to supplement, extend or reconfigure how people communicate through reshaping existing touch practices and generating new capacities. Their possible impact on interpersonal intimacy, wellbeing, cultural norms, ways of knowing and power relations is far-reaching and under-researched. Few emerging devices and applications are embedded into everyday touch practices, limiting empirical exploration of the implications of digital touch technologies in everyday communication. There is, thus, a real need for methodological innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration to critically examine digital touch communication across social contexts and technological domains, to better understand the social consequences of how touch is digitally remediated. This agenda-setting workshop will bring together HCI researchers and designers with colleagues from sociology, media &amp; communications, arts &amp; design to address key research challenges and build the foundations for future collaborations.},

abstract = {Conventional smart city design processes tend to focus on instrumental planning for city systems or novel services for humans. Interacting with data produced by the new services and restructured systems entailed by these processes is commonly done via interfaces like civic dashboards, leading to a critique that data-driven urbanism is bound by the rules and constraints of dashboard design [1]. Informed citizens are expected to engage with new urban information flows through the logic of dashboard interfaces. What datastreams are left off the dashboard of engaged urban experience? What design opportunities arise when dashboard visualizations are moved into the domain of mixed reality? In this two-day workshop, participants will construct prototype mixed reality interfaces for engaging the informational layer of the built urban environment. Using the Unity game engine and the Microsoft HoloLens, participants will focus on generative design in the space of data-driven interfaces, addressing issues of data access, civic agency, and privacy in the context of smart cities. Specific attention will be paid to interfaces that facilitate harmonious co-existence between humans and non-human systems (AI, IoT, etc.).},

abstract = {Sensemaking is a common activity in the analysis of a large or complex amount of information. This active area of HCI research asks how DO people come to understand such difficult sets of information? The information workplace is increasing dominated by high velocity, high volume, complex information streams. At the same time, understanding how sensemaking operates has become an urgent need in an era of increasingly unreliable news and information sources. While there has been a huge amount of work in this space, the research involved is scattered over a number of different domains with differing approaches. This workshop will focus on the most recent work in sensemaking, the activities, technologies and behaviors that people do when making sense of their complex information spaces. In the second part of the workshop we will work to synthesize a cross-disciplinary view of how sensemaking works in people, along with the human behaviors, biases, proclivities, and technologies required to support it.},

Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for such research within CHI and related fields such as gerontechnology. For this, we plan to create a space for discussing and sharing principles and strategies to design interactions and evaluate user interfaces for the aging population. We thus welcome contributions to empirical studies, theories, design and evaluation of user interfaces for older adults.

Requiring interdisciplinary skills and thinking, the field of HCI is well placed to contribute to the research and development of this technology. This workshop will build a community for human-centred researchers and practitioners to present studies, critiques, design-led work, and visions of blockchain applications.},

abstract = {The rise of evermore autonomy in vehicles and the expected introduction of self-driving cars have led to a focus on human interactions with such systems from an HCI perspective over the last years. Automotive User Interface researchers have been investigating issues such as transition control procedures, shared control, (over)trust, and overall user experience in automated vehicles. Now, it is time to open the research field of automated driving to other CHI research fields, such as Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI), aeronautics and space, conversational agents, or smart devices. These communities have been dealing with the interplay between humans and automated systems for more than 30 years. In this workshop, we aim to provide a forum to discuss what can be learnt from other domains for the design of autonomous vehicles. Interaction design problems that occur in these domains, such as transition control procedures, how to build trust in the system, and ethics will be discussed.},

abstract = {The built environment affects the behaviors and experience of its occupants. Recent technological advances have made it possible to simultaneously quantify features of indoor and outdoor built environments and people's reactions and behaviors within these environments. In a new research methodology, the "living lab", aspects of the environment are varied, and people's consequent reactions and behaviors to environmental changes are measured through a combination of objective automated sensing capabilities and behavioral techniques. This approach can be implemented within tightly controlled lab spaces or out in the real world, creating new opportunities to research human-environment interactions across a variety of environments and populations. In this workshop, we highlight the capabilities of the living lab methodology and share how insights from lab and real-world research can inform innovative applications to improve the health, performance, and well-being of building occupants.},

abstract = {Following their introduction in the 1960s, head-mounted VR systems mainly focused on visual and aural senses. In order to enhance immersion in the virtual world, researchers have since pursued the addition of movement and haptics through motion platforms, exoskeletons, and other hand-held devices. From a proliferation of low-cost devices that can sense the user's motion to full body motion capture suits, from gloves to gestures, natural interaction techniques have been desirable and explored in HCI and VR for several years. With virtual reality rapidly becoming accessible to mass audiences, there is growing interest in new forms of natural input techniques to enhance immersion and engagement in multiuser systems. First we need to determine what types of techniques can we design that would integrate well with multiuser experiences. Next, we need to understand the contribution of the designed techniques to the experience, understand how they work with existing controllers, and explore whether they should replace or augment current techniques in order to design more effective and engaging experiences. Finally, it is vital to discern the limitations and the types of application scenarios that are suitable for incorporating the techniques. The aim of this workshop is to deepen and expand the discussion on natural interaction techniques for collaborative VR within the CHI community and promote their relevance and research in HCI.},

abstract = {With HCI, researchers conduct studies in interdisciplinary projects involving massive volume of data, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Awareness of the responsibility is emerging as a key concern for the HCI community.This Community will be impacted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [5], that will enter into force on the 25th of May 2018. From that date, each data controller and data processor will face an increase of its legal obligations (in particular its accountability) under certain conditions.The GDPR encourages the adoption of Soft Law mechanisms, approved by the national competent authority on data protection, to demonstrate the compliance to the Regulation. Approved Guidelines, Codes of Conducts, Labeling, Marks and Seals dedicated to data protection, as well as certification mechanisms are some of the options proposed by the GDPR.There may be discrepancies between the realities of HCI fieldwork and the formal process of obtaining Soft Law approval by Competent Authorities dedicated to data protection. Given these issues, it is important for researchers to reflect on legal and ethical encounters in HCI research as a community.This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share experiences about Soft Law they have put in place to increase Trust, Transparency and Accountability among the shareholders. These discussions will be used to develop a white paper of practical Soft Law mechanisms (certification, labeling, marks, seals...) emerging in HCI research with the aim to demonstrate that the GDPR may be an opportunity for the HCI community.},

These events granted insight into how diversity discourses are approached within the CHI community. From these recognitions we provide examples of how diversity and inclusion can be promoted at future SIGCHI events. These include fostering connections between attendees, discussing 'polarizing' research in a conservative political climate, and encouraging contributions to the growing body of HCI literature addressing feminisms and related subjects. Finally, we suggest how these approaches and benefits can translate to HCI events extending beyond CHI, where exclusion may routinely go undetected.},

However, good metrics of 'true preferences' are difficult to define, as cognitive biases make people's preferences change with context and exhibit inconsistencies over time. Yet, HCI research often glosses over the philosophical and theoretical depth of what it means to infer what users really want. In this paper, we present an alternative yet very real discussion of this issue, via a fictive dialogue between senior executives in a tech company aimed at helping people live the life they 'really' want to live. How will the designers settle on a metric for their product to optimise?},

abstract = {As data increases in dimensionality or complexity, it becomes difficult to graphically represent data items or series in a straightforward way. Chernoff faces encode data values as features of a human face, but afford only a handful of dimensions, and can be difficult to decode. In this paper, we extend and improve Chernoff faces by merging them with the work of landscape painter Bob Ross, creating data-landscapes glyphs that directly encode data as three series with arbitrary numbers of data items per series. This is pretty obviously a bad idea, yet it is difficult to precisely articulate why, given the current state of the art in academic visualization. We propose and evaluate this technique as a way of highlighting these gaps in our ontology of bad visualization ideas, with the goal of being able to dismiss future bad ideas right out of the gate.},

Many unintentional effects, however, are beyond the scope, notice and accountability of current evaluation practices.

It argues that the well-established economic theory around externalities should be adapted to regulate this aspect of HCI: both to remedy inefficiencies and inequalities, and forestall further exploitation. To this end, the paper calls for recognition of cognitive property rights and for HCI to work towards evaluating any HCI technology as its complete delta in global cognition.},

abstract = {Almost all research output includes tables, diagrams, photographs and even sketches, and papers within HCI typically take advantage of including these figures in their files. However the space given to non diagrammatical or tabular figures is often small, even in papers that primarily concern themselves with visual output. The reason for this might be the publishing models employed in most proceedings and journals: Despite moving to a digital format which is unhindered by page count or physical cost, there remains a somewhat arbitrary limitation on page count. Recent moves by ACM SIGCHI and others to remove references from the maximum page count suggest that there is movement on this, however images remain firmly within the limits of the text. We propose that images should be celebrated - not penalised - and call for not only the adoption of the Pictorials format in CHI, but for images to be removed from page counts in order to encourage greater transparency of process in HCI research.},

Increasingly, this scholarship is dependent not only on localized contexts, but also the relationship of local contexts to the global stage, drawing on approaches such as ICT4D and cross-cultural design. In this paper, we examine authors' descriptions of study contexts, particularly country information, in paper titles and texts in the CHI Proceedings from 2013 to 2017. We found strikingly different patterns of titling between studies of Western and non-Western countries, including whether and how country names are mentioned in titles, and the precision when describing study contexts. Drawing on critical theories, we analyze how the politics of titling at CHI functions to build categories of "normal" and "exotic." We explicate the problems that the current ways of representation bring to knowledge production at CHI, and necessary paths to move forward.},

Some of the issues that researchers will discuss in this panel include: (1) obtaining VA data &amp; privacy concerns around the processing and storage of user data; (2) the personalization of VAs and the user value derived from this interaction; and (3) the relevant UX work that reflects on the design of VAs?},

abstract = {The ACM SIGCHI community has been at the forefront of addressing issues of equity and inclusivity in the design and use of technology, accounting for various aspects of users' identities such as gender, ethnicity, and sexuality. With this panel, we wish to explore how we, as SIGCHI, might better target similar goals of equity and inclusivity - across intersections - within our own community. We wish to create a forum for recognizing best practices regarding equity and inclusivity in participants' local and global contexts that we might feasibly integrate across SIGCHI. By equally prioritizing the voices of those in the audience and on the panel, we intend to foster a lively and constructive discussion that will help us chart a way forward. The takeaways from this panel will be articulated into an article for the Interactions magazine, targeting the larger human-computer interaction (HCI) community.},

abstract = {In recent times, many public spaces have virtual reality (VR) games for entertainment (e.g., VR amusement parks). Therefore, VR games should be attractive not only for players but also for bystanders. Current VR systems still focus primarily on enhancing the experience of head mounted display (HMD) users; thus, bystanders without an HMD cannot enjoy the experience to the same extent as HMD users. We propose "ReverseCAVE" towards a shareable VR experience [1]. This is a proof-of-concept prototype for public VR visualization using CAVE-based projection with translucent screens for bystanders. The screen surrounds the HMD user, and the VR environment is projected onto the screens. Bystanders can see the HMD user and VR environment simultaneously, and capture photographs to share with others. Thus, ReverseCAVE can enhance the bystanders' public VR experience considerably and expand the utility of VR.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things, not only people interact with objects, but also other objects; creating more complex material landscapes [2]. However, many thing-to-thing interactions are currently designed within a simple and linear paradigm: using mobile devices to remotely control connected objects. With these videos, we aim to explore more complex interrelationships, using a thing-centered design perspective in a speculative way. To this end, we position things within entanglements: fluid assemblages formed and dissolved in a situated way. This shows new possibilities for everyday objects to co-perform tasks, and 'carry' information that can be interpreted further as new perspectives are gained through interaction. Additionally, as entanglements implies a complicated relationship, we aim to provoke a reflection on the conflicts that may arise between things, and the implications of them (mis)interpreting our behavior.},

However, the ability to program these machines often requires years of training, making them inaccessible or impractical for many. This project rethinks what robot programming interfaces could be in order to make them accessible and intuitive for adult novice programmers. We created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot and conducted a study with 67 adult novices comparing it to two programming approaches in widespread use in industry. The results show participants using the block-based interface successfully implemented robot programs faster with no loss in accuracy while reporting higher scores for usability, learnability, and overall satisfaction. The contribution of this work is showing the potential for using block-based programming to make powerful technologies accessible to a wider audience.},

As a result of an experiment, per-user recognition accuracy was 87.6% for eleven face-related movements. During an experiment, we also found that there are individual differences of changes in the air pressure. Based on this finding, we examined a possibility of user-identification/authentication. As a result, CanalSense+ can identify 12 users with the accuracy of 90.6%.},

abstract = {This video was produced as part of the participatory speculative design project "Sankofa City." The project engages community residents to design emerging technologies (e.g. augmented reality, ubicomp, and self-driving cars) tied to their cultural practices. This collaboration is based in the African-American neighborhood of Leimert Park, in South Los Angeles. With increasing urban development in the area, residents are concerned about cultural displacement.In this twelve-week workshop series, local residents worked with university students (Figure 1) to design and plan their neighborhood's future. Groups began by brainstorming high-level concepts through "what if" hypothetical questions. Then they created prototypes and scenarios based on their user personas, which were inspired by local residents. Lastly, they created seven collages (Figure 2) and a design fiction video to share at a local stakeholders' meeting, in order to gather larger community feedback. The video portrays an ARenabled self-driving shuttle that dynamically displays local history. The video was particularly effective for gaining community buy-in and has since been shown at a number of local events and festivals. By grounding speculative designs in a community context, students and residents imagined novel technologies that support Leimert Park's local economy and project their cultural heritage into the unknown future.},

We see the design challenge not in automating cooking tasks, but in augmenting the tangible experience, skill building and enjoyment of baking. As an example of such augmentation, we present a novel concept for designing and fabricating roll cakes with custom cross-section graphics.Roll cakes are made by rolling a flat piece of cake into a spiral. In our application, users draw the cross section image of their cake and we calculate a printable template as a guide to color the unrolled cake. Users mix colored batter and use a custom 3D printed nozzle to arrange the batter on the template.After baking the batter in the oven, users simply roll it into a roll cake and magically their design is shown on the cross-section.We identified and solved the key difficulties in making graphics such as a consistent layer thickness and aligning the graphics in the spiral. With Rolling Graphics, we expand the potential of food printing with custom graphics and potentially, custom tastes.},

We explore how voice UI may benefit from a visual component that re-enforces a mental model for otherwise structureless interactions. The lack of a visual representation of voice assistants can make the adoption and learning curve slower. Our system can help to discover capabilities of a physical tethered device that otherwise would be imperceptible.

This work showcases how things could be designed from a different perspective: seemingly aware, but intentionally non-engaging. IdleBot is a very furry robotic puppet that is waiting. Unlike many applications in social robotics, IdleBot has neither clear purpose, nor explicit functionality - it merely exists and waits. The subtleness of its interaction, consisting of mostly idle motions, is the starting point to investigate forms of interaction bordering non-interaction situated in a personal context. In two iterations, we designed a fully working interactive prototype that embodies different modes of waiting. The design of waiting behaviors is based on a prior observation study with 20 participants, whose waiting behavior was recorded for each one minute under the false pretense of having to wait for a "real" experiment to start. A Kinect device tracks people in close proximity and allows IdleBot to glance at them in serendipity. The video shows what happened when we released IdleBot into the wild.},

It's design is to deliberately open the discussion of what it is to be photographer, or collaborator or even facilitator of a complex apparatus with a discrete system at it's core. A system that extends beyond the physical body of the device and reaches into the heart of our human culture of creation, consumption, reflection, storytelling and the active shaping of our identity and self image. The project has several separate aspects dealing with hardware, software, interaction design and media and photographic theory. This paper and the body of work it describes is the first collection of portraits and street photography produced with this new apparatus. The collection is arranged as a virtual reality photographic essay or artists photo-book.

abstract = {Constructs:Conducts is an immersive interactive work for Montreal's Satosphere Dome. The audience is immersed in a color and sound space. This work involves assigning each element to a single track of a multi-track recording device with up to a maximum of 96 different tone colours assignable per colour image. By manipulating the fader controls on a mixer desk, each sound can be blended to create one overall colour tone of evolving complexity. Each of the visualised colour hues are assigned one overall tonal mass with minute shifts in timbral values and locative displacements. The work is symbolic of the artists' respective fields of enquiry into colour for the Post-digital Futures.},

abstract = {This paper describes an interactive installation called 'Intermodulator' that generates diverse patterns of moir\'{e} image through participants' collaborative and improvisational sound engagement. This installation is comprised of ordinary box fans, backlights, and microphones. The custom-designed system enables the speed of the individual fans and the brightness of the backlights to interact with different live sound inputs. When a certain resonance and tension are achieved between these input sounds, the installation produces seemingly stationary or moir\'{e} images of the fans. The main contribution of this installation is to suggest an experiential space where participants can (a) produce artistic audio-visual performances through collaborative improvisation, and (b) empirically explore the key features of collaborative improvisation that promote creativity and learning. This paper introduces the concept, background, and technical details of the project, and proposes its site-specific version for Satosphere Dome at the SAT.},

abstract = {"Weight of Data" is a series of the light art installations that has started with a question, 'What value our digital and non-digital commodities represent for us in data?' In order to make a sense of the value of data-driven virtual commodity into artworks, the artist decided to measure the value of a cryptocurrency into the weight of physical, edible commodities - rice, sugar and salt. Each artwork of this series is composed with 1 Kg of each agricultural raw product with embedded electronic parts. These selected commodities are valuable as being essential for human survivals and they used to function as a currency traded in history. Each artwork displays transformative light patterns in vivid colors through an algorithm that calculates the value of single cryptocurrency into the weight of each commodity value. It refreshes every 2 minutes in real-time along with the numeric ticker on screen that represents for the weight increase or decrease in correlation with the value of cryptocurrency against each commodity. With the embedded layers of cultural and historical context of these commodities, the artist asks an open question on the current issues of data by contrasting tangible ancient currency against virtual new currency.},

A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service given the limited functionality of the API provided. The piece finds parallels in early experimental music that manipulates magnetic tape and vinyl records. On the contrary, the audiovisual space that a musician can explore on the fly is practically infinite.

MASOM is then able to improvise live interacting with the other (human) performers by imitating the style of what it reminds it of. For each musician, a corresponding visual agent puts its sound and musical decision into images thus allowing the audience to see who does what. This reveals the musical gestures that are so often lost in electronic music performance. For CHI, MASOM plays with two live performers for a 20 minute audiovisual REVIVE experience.},

However, few studies have evaluated users' open-ended exploration of multi-dimensional datasets using VR and compared the results with that of traditional (2D) visualizations. Using a workload- and insight-based evaluation methodology, we conducted a user study to perform such a comparison. We find that there is no overall task-workload difference between traditional visualizations and visualizations in VR, but there are differences in the accuracy and depth of insights that users gain. Our results also suggest that users feel more satisfied and successful when using VR data exploration tools, thus demonstrating the potential of VR as an engaging medium for visual data analytics.},

abstract = {Designing interactive visualizations is challenging, especially in complex, open-ended contexts. Although numerous interaction techniques have been developed, there is a lack of holistic theoretical guidance in the visualization literature on designing interactivity, where interactivity refers to the overall quality of interaction between a user and a visualization tool. In this work, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the design and evaluation of interactivity by exploring user perceptions in an exploratory context. We report the findings of a lab study and reflect on its potential implications for visualization designers and researchers.},

However, the presentation and interaction design of data visualization integrated into the physical environment may vary in different scales. Understanding how users manage their spatial relationships with AR visualization under different representational scales is crucial for designing user-friendly AR-empowered visual analytic systems. To this end, we present a study with 16 participants, inviting them to solve two logical reasoning puzzles by interacting with the associated node-link graphs in AR in room- and table-scales respectively. Through observation, interviews, and video analysis, we identify three types of spatial arrangements, which are, positioning the visualization in the figural, vista, or panoramic space of a user. We further explore how scales and visualization design affect users' spatial preferences and exploratory behaviors, and summarize our findings among the three types of spatial arrangements.},

Notifications are an essential part of current smartphones and inform users about various events, such as new messages, pending updates, personalized news, and upcoming appointments. PD Notify implements privacy settings to control what is shown on the public displays. We conducted an in-situ study in a semi-public work environment for three weeks with seven participants. The results of this first deployment show that displaying personal content on public displays is not only feasible but also valued by users. Participants quickly settled for privacy settings that work for all kinds of content. While they liked the system, they did not want to spend time configuring it.},

However, these attempts have focused on increasing human-like traits of agents, thereby overlooking the possible advantage of machine inherits, such as lack of emotion or the ability to perform calculations. Therefore, this paper aims to shed light on the machine inherits of CAs to help satisfy the emotional needs of teenagers. We conducted a workshop with 20 teenagers, followed by in-depth interviews with six of the participants. We discovered that teenagers expected CAs to (1) be good listeners due to their lack of emotion, (2) keep their secrets by being separated from the human world, and (3) give them advice based on the analysis of sufficient data. Based on our findings, we offer three design guidelines to build CAs.},

Pro-social crowdfunding platforms allow for online campaigns to raise money, and these fundraisers rely more heavily on emotions to attract backers because there are no financial incentives to contribute to these campaigns. People give to pro-social crowdfunding campaigns out of empathy and sympathy for the campaign beneficiaries. Using prior research on empathy, we considered the emotional drivers of empathy and examined how campaigns convey those emotions using campaign pictures and language. We analyzed the facial expressions in campaign pictures and the emotional words in the campaign language, and we found that emotions shape fundraising success. Furthermore, our study shows that the same emotion - happiness/joy - leads to different fundraising success based on whether it is conveyed visually or textually. A future experiment will more explicitly connect these emotions to empathy in potential backers.},

To address this problem, we created Lunchocracy, an anonymous decision support tool for lunch spots in a workplace based on feedback from a focus group with 7 participants. The tool implements a conversational skype-bot, Lunchbot, that allows users to express interest in joining lunch and to vote for diners to eat at. We deployed the tool for four weeks with 14 participants from the same university department. Post-interviews with 5 participants revealed an overall satisfaction with Lunchocracy, in particular due to it structuring the lunch decision-making and saving time.

Even though the popularity has seen a steady increase, the use of IoT devices has been slow and abandonment rapid. To build on the existing literature and advance our understanding of the sociological processes of use and non-use of these devices, this paper presents results from the survey of 489 IoT users. Our qualitative analysis of open ended questions revealed that the motives for use include multi-functionality of devices that provide control over daily activities, social competitive edge, economic advantage, and habit. The justifications for limiting or stopping the use include privacy concerns, information overload and inaccuracy, demotivation because of the reminders about pending or failed goals, no excitement after satisfying initial curiosity, and maintenance becoming unmanageable in terms of effort, time, and money.},

An online experiment was conducted in which participants had to enter numeric codes into an online spreadsheet. They had to look up these codes in an email sent to their personal email address upon starting the experiment. People who were shown how long they were away for made shorter switches, were faster to complete the task and made fewer data entry errors. This suggests feedback on switching duration may make people more aware of their switching behaviour, and assist users in maintaining focus on their main task.},

Asking crowdworkers to make plans for others' tasks only works for independent (context-free) tasks, and asking people who have context (e.g., friends or collaborators) has social costs and quality concerns. Our goal is to reduce the costs and improve quality of planning by people who have context in the context-rich domain of writing. We introduce a vocabulary (a finite set of functions pertaining to writing tasks) to aid the planning process. We develop a writing vocabulary by analyzing 264 comments, and compare plans created using this vocabulary to those created without any aid, in a study with 768 comments (N=145). We show that using a vocabulary reduces the planning time and effort compared to unstructured planning, and opens the door for automation and task sharing for complex tasks.},

This is true for both "factual", objective tags such as time, place and people, as well as for subjective labels, such as the emotion a picture generates. Indeed, the ability to associate emotions to images is one of the key functionality most image analysis services today strive to provide. In this paper we study how emotion labels for images can be crowdsourced and uncover limitations of the approach commonly used to gather training data today, that of harvesting images and tags from social media.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is recently attracting vendors like Google, Homey, and Samsung that have already brought to the market a plethora of devices and services supporting smart home automation. However, recent studies have shown that end-users having little knowledge of the features and possibilities of IoT devices, face difficulties in conjuring up meaningful use scenarios that combine such devices. Therefore, they fail to anticipate useful configurations beyond those provided by vendors and hence missing out on the vast potential of the IoT. We present an on-going investigation that explores the potential of sourcing IoT-relevant scenarios from a popular microtask-crowdsourcing platform, and a preliminary evaluation of such scenarios with respect to their originality and practicality. This work paves the way for the automated leverage of crowdsourced user scenarios to support IoT end-users.},

abstract = {A major goal of collaborative ideation is improving the creativity of the ideas generated. Recent approaches enhance creativity by showing users similar ideas during productive ideation and diverse ideas when they reach an impasse. However, related work either demands a higher mental effort from users to assess similarity or yields only a limited number of similarity values. Furthermore, idea relationship is only considered in one dimension (similarity). In our research in progress, we introduce a new approach called concept validation. It enables us to (1) capture the conceptualization of users' ideas and (2) assess multi-dimensional relationships between all ideas in near real-time. We conducted a study with 90 participants to validate the suitability of our approach. The results indicate that adding the extraction of semantic concepts to the ideation process has no negative impact on number and creativity of ideas generated. This signifies an important step towards our vision of an idea-based knowledge graph used by an interactive system to improve computer-supported human creativity.},

However, native speakers (NS) may dominate cross-lingual teamwork communicating solely in a common language, which may reduce diversity and harm productivity of the whole group. As a solution, we consider it necessary to support non-native speakers' (NNS) contribution for equalizing NS' and NNS' participation. In this study, we examine how recent language support technologies might affect the group dynamics of collocated multilingual teams consisting of multiple NSs and NNSs. In our experiment, quads of two NSs and two NNSs were provided with a language support tool that integrates machine translation, automatic speech recognition and shared display to enable NNSs participating in multilingual teamwork without requiring them to use a common language. Automatic language detection allowed them to dynamically decide what language to use in their group discussions. We found that using the tool increased the variety of languages used (e.g., Chinese, English and Japanese) and had the potential to equalize NS' and NNS' participation.},

To improve self-motivation of completing a task and produce similar effects of social reminders, we propose "pseudo social reminders", a personal task management system where users can set social reminders by themselves for their own social tasks. The goal of this research is to investigate how pseudo social reminders affect task management and how users perceive these message notifications. We built an Android app that uses notifications showing the sender's name and photo to increase awareness of what users need to do and conducted a one week field study. The results from the user study showed that when receiving a message from a group member related to the task, participants felt social influence. Most participants selected the reminding group that were related to the task and could remember the task with a greater impact through photos as visual aids.},

The hands-free operability and portability of a head-mounted display could allow physicians and nurses to monitor vital signs constantly and independently of location. We developed an application that displays vital signs of multiple patients on a Vuzix M300 head-mounted display.

Faced with an absence of tools to collect and manage biographical materials, we created a web platform that supports the work of psychologists, streamlining the collection of relevant information about people with dementia. This knowledge is then used as a starting point to perform reminiscence and other biographical cognitive stimulation practices.

Jazzy has been designed in collaboration with a target end user of the system from its early stages. Jazzy exploits visual layers to display different contents for each eye on the Head Mounted Display (HMD) screens. In this way, the system becomes a controllable tool to stimulate eyes individually. In addition, taking advantage of the HMD associated controllers, the system is able to track the user in the physical space, enhancing the perceived realism during the VR experience. Users can train hand-eye coordination skills in a more lifelike and engaging manner. Jazzy also provides an interface for caregivers empowering them with a new support tool that can be used alongside classic therapeutic artifacts.

In addition, taking advantage of the HMD associated controllers, the system is able to track the user in the physical space, enhancing the perceived realism during the VR experience. Users can train hand-eye coordination skills in a more lifelike and engaging manner. Jazzy also provides an interface for caregivers empowering them with a new support tool that can be used alongside classic therapeutic artifacts. In this paper we describe the eye-specific parametric visual stimuli and the caregiver's interface to tune them remotely for plug and play activities that can be experienced at home.},

abstract = {Pregnancy loss is a common complication in pregnancy. Yet those who experience it can find it challenging to disclose this loss and feelings associated with it, and to seek support for psychological and physical recovery. We describe our process for interleaving interviews, theoretical development, speculative design, and prototyping Not Alone to explore the design space for online disclosures and support seeking in the pregnancy loss context. Interviews with 27 women who had experienced pregnancy loss resulted in theoretical concepts such as "network-level reciprocal disclosure" (NLRD). In this paper, we focus on how interview findings informed the design of the Not Alone prototype, a mobile application aimed at enabling disclosure and social support exchange among those with pregnancy loss experience. The Not Alone prototype embodies concepts that facilitate NLRD: perceptions of homophily, anonymity levels, and self-disclosure by talking about one's experience and engaging with others' disclosures. In future work, we will use Not Alone as a technology probe for exploring and evaluating NLRD as a design principle.},

abstract = {Fatal overdoses are a common symptom of the opioid epidemic which has been devastating communities throughout the USA for decades. Philadelphia has been particularly impacted, with a drug overdose death rate of 46.8 per 100,000 individuals, far surpassing other large cities' rates. Despite city and community efforts, this rate continues to increase, indicating the need for new, more effective approaches aimed at mitigating and combating this issue. Through a human-centered design process, we investigated motivators and barriers to participation in a smartphone-based system that mobilizes community members to administer emergency care for individuals experiencing an overdose. We discuss evidence of the system's feasibility, and how it would benefit from integration with existing community-based efforts.},

abstract = {Technologically-mediated learning environments are becoming increasingly popular, however remote learning still lacks many of the important interpersonal features that are leveraged in effective co-located learning. Recent work has started to build in non-verbal cues to support remote collaboration, such as showing pairs where their partner is looking on the screen. This method of displaying gaze visualizations has been shown to support coordination and learning in remote collaborative tasks. However, we have yet to explore how this technique scales to support multiple students with one teacher in a technology-mediated learning environment. In this study, we design and evaluate a system for displaying real time gaze information from multiple students to a single teacher's display during a computer science studio session. Our results suggest that multiple gaze visualizations can improve the teaching experience in remote settings. Further, we provide design recommendations for future systems based on our preliminary results.},

A companion app allows children to scan these sentences to receive audio and AR feedback. Block Talks takes advantage of colour cues to draw children's attention to sentence structure patterns.

Despite its importance, existing language learning systems often focus on linguistic components such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. Consequently, foreign language learners may generate grammatically flawless speech that is contextually inappropriate. With the diverse socio-cultural contexts captured in real-life settings, videos at scale can serve as a great material to acquire pragmatic competence. We introduce Exprgram, a web-based video learning interface that assists learners to master pragmatic competence. In Exprgram, learners can raise their context-awareness, practice generating an alternative expression, and learn diverse alternative expressions for the given context. Our user study with 12 advanced English learners displays the potential in our learnersourcing approach to collect descriptive context annotations and diverse alternative expressions.},

Maintaining high levels of enjoyment and positive social interactions are important because both can promote retention and continuation of gameplay and exercise adherence. Early results of a pilot study seem to show that player pairs who score high on openness and extraversion particularly enjoyed their game experience together.},

abstract = {One fundamental way how players relate to games is through the avatar they are represented by. In this work, we explore the impact of realtime adjustment of avatar appearance (visual body weight) on player motivation in exergames. Our results draw a mixed picture: while qualitative findings show that players were aware of adaptations, quantitative results do not demonstrate significant differences in player motivation. Instead, observations suggest that players leveraged the mechanic to develop their own meta-game, an effect that needs to be considered when designing mechanics that aim to improve player motivation in exergaming settings.},

abstract = {Total-Knee-Replacement (TKR) is becoming a prevalent procedure for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis among older adults worldwide. A key to the success of TKR is an effective post-surgical rehabilitation. However, for TKR patients, pain is a major factor that hinders them from taking up the rehabilitation exercise fully and leads to unsatisfactory functional recovery rate. To help TKR patients cope with pain and adhere more to rehabilitation exercises, we design a gamified rehabilitation tool, Fun-Knee, for effective pain distraction based on the "Peak-End Effect" theory. We have developed the alpha version of Fun-Knee and conducted an acceptability and usability test of its hardware and software. The results from a focus group show the general acceptance of end users on Fun-Knee.},

abstract = {Food Literacy (FL) is associated with the improvement of autonomy and confidence around food, healthier dietary intake, and chronic disease prevention. However, to date, behaviour change research at CHI has focused on motivating healthy eating mainly through weight loss and calorie control, which can lead to poor nutritional choices as consumers optimize caloric intake over a balanced diet. To address this gap, we designed a mobile game called Pirate Bri's Grocery Adventure, that seeks to improve FL through a situated learning approach to grocery shopping. Our game leverages Self Determination Theory (SDT) to build a player's competence, autonomy, and relatedness as shoppers are encouraged to develop an understanding of the nutritional benefits of foods and are rewarded for balancing sugar, sodium, fats and fibre in their purchases.},

abstract = {The general promise of employing the motivational power of games for serious purposes, such as performing physiotherapy exercises, is well-established. However, game user research discusses both the approach of gamification, i.e. adding game-elements on to a task-focused application and of serious games, i.e. injecting task-focused elements into a more fully-fledged game. There is a surprising lack of empirical work that contrasts both approaches. We present both a casually gamified application and a serious game with purpose-driven mechanics that provide different frontends to the same underlying digital health application. This application aims at supporting physiotherapy sessions for chronic lower-back afflictions. Results from an explorative pre-study contrasting both approaches indicate a clear preference for the serious game version, capturing higher perceived motivational components (autonomy and relatedness), as well as higher immersion and flow relative to the gamified version.},

To see how children and parents would accept the concept, we created a preliminary prototype and conducted user study using Wizard-of-Oz method. Participants experienced enhanced immersion and increased communication between them by through the automatic movement of the puppet. They expected various roles from the puppet such as actor, support tool, and friend, which made various usage scenarios possible. The puppet should be developed in the direction of enhancing its advantages and including various usage scenarios, especially by combining the needs of both automation and manipulation.},

Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel system to help generate paper-cut pattern and give the fabricating instruction with digital design and interactive technology. Our system is expected to spark the creativity of paper-cut pattern for designers, lower the fabricated barrier for novices, and promote the development and application of paper-cut.},

Our findings suggest that to effectively support children with ASD in Sri Lanka, technological interventions should focus on multi-player functionalities to promote social interactions. We further identified the characteristics that are required in a software application to effectively support children with ASD in Sri Lanka, namely support for 1) timers to avoid screen addiction, 2) tangible user interfaces, 3) customization, and 4) cultural context.

Then, we connect that to the engagement of a third person (gift-giver) in the process, highlighting the potential of such involvement.

Less is known about how an agent is perceived and used during human-human conversation. We compared conversations between dyads using AI-assisted and standard messaging apps and elicited qualitative feedback from users of the AI-assisted messaging app through interviews. We find discrepancies between the AI assistant's suggestions and the conversational content, which is also reflected in participant interviews. Our results are used to suggest some areas for improvement and future work in AI-assisted communication.},

abstract = {In the time of highly automated driving, the role of drivers is shifting from actual driving to being a passenger, supervisor, or a cooperative partner. In the case of cooperative driver-vehicle interaction, new interfaces have to be developed, for instance to approve maneuvers. We implemented two different interaction techniques (clicking and holding down a button) to approve an overtaking maneuver on rural roads. We conducted a driving simulator study to investigate the effects of the interaction techniques on a touchscreen regarding usability. Our results suggest that a simple click provides better usability. Finally, we highlight future research directions that should be considered for the design of such interfaces for cooperative driver-vehicle interaction.},

Specifically, we investigate whether a VK seat, i.e., a seat using movement and vibration synchronized with a given media, induces psychophysiological states aligned with an optimal immersive virtual reality (VR) experience. We test our hypotheses with subjects in a seated position while experiencing a passive vehicular movement with a VR headset. Using a between-subject experiment, 45 participants were randomly assigned to a VK or a non-VK condition. Users' psychophysiological states were measured using electrodermal activity, heart rate, and user perceptions. We find evidence that VK significantly enhances the physiological activation of the user throughout the experience. Also, we find that VK seems to create a psychological state that requires less conscious autoregulation, which could suggest that users experience less cybersickness in this condition.},

Key takeaways included: (a) practitioners came from a variety of backgrounds resulting in multidisciplinary teams; (b) leadership desired UX employees that were generalists; and (c) inexpensive tools designed for UX were common for creating artifacts and facilitating communication resulting in a dynamic tool-scape. These findings have implications for instructors teaching in UX and students in UX programs; we also argue the findings will interest UX practitioners who are curious about sharing and learning from each other.},

Also, we linearly increased the cognitive demand while solving the tasks. This allowed us to analyze the reaction of individual eye movements to different levels of task difficulty. Our results show how pupil dilation, blink rate, and the number of fixations and saccades per second individually react to changes in cognitive activity. We discuss how these measurements could be combined in future work to allow for a comprehensive investigation of cognitive load in interactive settings.},

Thus, this study investigates how the richness of the information provided by an RA and the effort necessary to reach this information influence users' perceptions and usage. A within-subject lab experiment was conducted with 20 participants. Results suggest that perceptions toward the RA (trust, credibility, and satisfaction) are influenced by the RA information richness, but not by the effort needed to reach this information.

However, simulating accurate behavior in computer generated humans remains a challenge. In this study, we tested the effects of full body behavior (Body Movement and Head Movement) in terms of viewers perception (comfortability with and realism of the computer generated human) using an animated computer generated human in virtual reality. Our findings imply the significant influence of body animation (excluding head animation) on both comfortability and realism of the computer generated human. 37.5% of the participants did not notice the exclusion of the head animation; implying the importance of body animations over head animations. Using the results, we derive guidelines on computer generated human design and realization as well as their influence on the viewer's perception. Finally, we discuss the constraints that should be taken into account when animating in virtual reality.},

But if the two are strangers then only a snapshot image is shared. By varying the fidelity of the shared content, the viewer is able to focus more on the data shared by their close relations and differentiate this from other content. Also, the approach enables the sharing-user to have more control over the fidelity of the content shared with their contacts for privacy.},

Our study is divided into three stages: a pilot study, implementation, and a user study. In this paper, we discuss our efforts as related to the first two stages of our study. The pilot study was used to determine user expectations for the arms. Participants found the arms effective for describing an area from a fixed location. Users also preferred additional arms that can be controlled and are physically similar to their existing arms. Our prototype consists of a virtual mirror that augments the user's body with additional arms. We discuss future directions for improving our implementation and outline a plan for the user study.},

abstract = {This paper describes Toccata, an activity-centric system for classroom orchestration. Through preliminary fieldwork, we identified three main challenges in the management of digital activities in classrooms: 1. Poor infrastructures lead to breakdowns in the activity 2. Activity structures are idiosyncratic (they vary widely and are rarely shared); and 3. Orchestration is difficult because teachers lack an overview of the unfolding activities. We developed Toccata to support activity scripting and orchestration in situations with unreliable connectivity. Based on a preliminary trial, we outline directions for activity-centric orchestration systems: 1. Focus on timing; 2. Provide several levels of awareness; 3. Support activity suspend and resume in changing contexts.},

Further, we build a digital machine to construct the conductive paths accurately. With a specially designed housing base, users can simply snap the electronic components onto the surfaces and obtain working physical prototypes.

The tool, based on a Rasp-berry Pi 2 microcomputer, repeatedly toggles a button of a game controller, mouse, or keyboard via an opto-coupler soldered to the button and measures the time until the input event arrives. This helps researchers, developers and users to identify and characterize sources of input lag.

The high number of messages with non deterministic delivery timings, as well as message losses, data corruption and node crashes cannot be efficiently analyzed with traditional GUI tools. We propose to use immersive technologies in a multi-display environment to tackle these shortcomings. Our DebugAR approach shows a representation of the current systems state, message provenance, and the lifetime of participating nodes and offers layouting techniques. By providing a screen that shows a traditional text-log, we bridge the gap to conventional tools. Additionally, we propose an interactive 3D visualization of the message flow, combining an interactive tabletop with augmented reality using a head-mounted display. We are confident that our proposed solution can not only be used to analyze distributed system, but also for other time-dependent networks.},

Specifically, the acquisition of three basic motion elements, i.e., rigid-body motion, deformation, and vibration were investigated. These elements enables natural and high degrees of freedom interactions. In the proposed system, the three motion elements are simultaneously estimated from on-surface velocities, which are measured using a galvanoscopic scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. A method for the measurement of the rigid-body motion, deformation, and vibration is proposed. In addition, we demonstrate several applications of the proposed system, including an on-hand UI with hand gestures, a vibration-based object recognition application, and a conceptual tangible UI.

However, it is still unclear as to which congruence plays the primary role in the process during the voluntary movements. We conducted a user study that distinguishes proprioceptive information and prediction from motor commands by displaying the modified images of the participants' hands in various rotation angles; this introduced the conflict between visual and proprioceptive information. The hand motions of the participants were restricted so that they could predict the visual motion of the images of their hands by the motor command even while the images were rotated. The result indicates that motion prediction plays a primary role in the recognition process of self-attribution, and this predictability depends on the motion pattern and appearance of the hand images.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of social media, many person-to-person interactions happen in the virtual space using various metaphors like emojis, tweets, and likes. In this late breaking work, we aim to map such metaphors from the virtual world into the physical world and understand the interactions that follow. We have proposed and prototyped a wearable that is a tangible representation of two social media metaphors: poke and categorizing people as friends, acquaintances, and strangers. These categories have been represented using touch patches and the interactions are visualized on the wearable.},

abstract = {A common way to display information via tactile output is to use vibration motors. However, vibration is often perceived as a rather artificial, even unpleasant cue. We explore a novel method based on pneumatic cues to provide a more natural tactile output. We use two airbags positioned at the back of the user, at shoulder height to give navigational cues. We utilize the shoulder tap metaphor to give directions to the left, right or ahead. We compare the pneumatic cue to vibro-tactile cue at the same position. Our Results show, that the pneumatic cue was rated as significantly less urgent than vibro-tactile cue. As there were no significant differences in error rate, annoyance and usability, we rate ShoulderTap as eligible alternative to vibro-tactile cues.},

In Study 1, we develop a psychophysical model of continuous illusory motion on a discrete vibrotactile array. We use this model to generate a variety of tactile strokes that vary in frequency (quality), amplitude (strength) and duration (speed), and test them on a hedonic scale of pleasant-unpleasant in Study 2. Our results show that low frequency (&lt;40 Hz) strokes at low amplitude (light touch) are felt pleasant, while high frequency strokes are unpleasant. High amplitude strokes are biased towards unpleasantness. Our results are useful for artificial means to enhance social presence among individuals in virtual and augmented settings.},

abstract = {Vision and audition are widely used in human-computer social interaction. Even though highly performant tactile sensors are available on the market, very few social interfaces exploit haptics as a sensing modality. Touch is a fundamental channel to communicate complex social feeling. Recent haptic studies show up changes of paradigm in the design of social touch interfaces. In this research, we investigate the design of a new compliant electronic skin (e-skin) based on piezoresitive carbon nanotube (CNT) films to facilitate interaction. CNT e-skin uses tiny mechanical sensors, fabricated at low cost. Because of their 3D structure, CNT mechanical response can be easily adjusted accordingly to the application. Here, we present the multimodality of the CNT e-skin. Inspired by human somatosensory system, this compliant CNT e-skin is sensitive to the pressure, temperature and moisture. The first integration on a robotic platform is on-going work, with the objective of using it as social interaction modality.},

abstract = {Today, public displays are used to display general purpose information or advertisements in many public and urban spaces. In addition to that, research identified novel application scenarios for public displays. These scenarios, however, mainly include gesture- and posture-based interaction mainly relying on optical tracking. Deploying optical tracking systems in the real world is not always possible since real-world deployments have to tackle several challenges. These challenges include changing light conditions or privacy concerns. In this paper, we explore how smart fabric can detect the user's posture. We particularly focus on the user's arm posture and how this can be used for interacting with public displays. We conduct a preliminary study to record different arm postures, create a model to detect arm postures. Finally, we conduct an evaluation study using a simple game that uses the arm posture as input. We show that smart textiles are suitable to detect arm postures and feasible for this type of application scenarios.},

Through these achievements, we can enhance multi-user collaboration in a large-screen environment. We developed a macro development and execution environment that fulfills conditions 1) development and 2) execution and applied it to the tabletop interface. We conducted qualitative evaluations on 1) development and 2) execution, and quantitative evaluations on 2) execution. The study suggested the usefulness of the environment in scenarios where multiple users use a tabletop interface with many kinds of macros.},

These findings should serve to better inform security education across differing levels of technical experience. Preliminary findings indicate that both user groups were influenced by similar sources of information; however, expert users differed in having more professional requirements affecting choices (e.g., BYOD). Furthermore, experts often added biometric authentication methods opportunistically during device updates, despite describing higher security concern and caution. Non-experts struggled with the setting up fingerprint biometrics, leading to poor adoption. Further interviews are still being conducted.},

The answer to this question is interesting because prior research has revealed a positive effect on performance when providing intelligent interruptions, for example based on users' level of attention. Our work launches research on interruptibility in IVR by investigating (1) the relationship between attention, presence and workload, and the (2) methods for measuring them in IVR. Our analysis suggests that a trade-off between presence and attention is required when designing interruptions for IVR. Our findings are valuable for researchers and practitioners who want to collect data on attention, presence and workload in IVR to inform interruptibility.},

This research evaluated the effects of stress on fNIRS measurements and performance, using the Montreal Imaging Stress Task to manipulate the experience of stress. While our results largely support this hypothesis, our conclusions were undermined by data from the Rest condition, which indicated that Mental Workload and Stress were often higher than during tasks. We hypothesize that participants were experiencing anxiety in anticipation of subsequent stress tasks. We discuss this hypothesis and present a revised study designed to better control for this result.},

Following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed young survivors expressing post-trauma stress in block play. Motivated by the limitations in assessing this behavior using traditional methods, our paper describes the design rationales of AssessBlocks, an action-characterizing system using smartwatch embedded toy blocks. Utilizing a smartwatch's Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and capacitive screen, a monitor is able to receive, visualize and document sequential and quantitative play actions that were empirically selected from a preliminary block therapy study on children's post-disaster stress. We also propose our vision of a multi-dimensional behavioral assessment system using actions obtained by AssessBlocks.},

Perceiving the personality traits of others based on the way they look or sound is a key aspect of how humans unconsciously adapt their communication with others. In an effort to model this complex human process for eventual application to conversational agents, this paper presents the results of (1) building SVM and HMM classifiers for perceived personality prediction using speech signals using a data corpus of 640 speech signals based on 11 Big Five personality assessments, (2) determining correlations between feature and speaker subgroups, and (3) assessing the SVM classifier performance on new speech signals collected and assessed through a user study. This work is a small step towards the greater goal of designing more emotionally intelligent conversational interfaces.},

However, existing methods for assessing personality have shortcomings: self-assessed methods are cumbersome due to repeated assessment and erroneous due to a self-report bias. On the other hand, automatic, data-driven personality detection raises privacy concerns due to a need for excessive personal data. We present an unobtrusive method for detecting personality within the workplace that combines a user's online and offline behaviors. We report insights from analyzing data collected from four different workplaces with 37 participants, which shows that complementing online and offline data allows a more complete reflection of an individual's personality. We also present possible applications of unobtrusive personality detection in the workplace.},

We describe an exploratory study of how individuals react, respond to, and evaluate the authenticity of images that accompany online stories in Internet-enabled communications channels. Our preliminary findings support the assertion that people perform poorly at detecting skillful image manipulation, and that they often fail to question the authenticity of images even when primed regarding image forgery through discussion. We found that viewers make credibility evaluation based mainly on non-image cues rather than the content depicted. Moreover, our study revealed that in cases where context leads to suspicion, viewers apply post-hoc analysis to support their suspicions regarding the authenticity of the image.},

The goals of the research were to assess the effectiveness of methods that online services use to label ads, and to see if alternative methods of labeling ads could improve consumers' ability to recognize them. In a controlled experiment, 48 consumers interacted with both desktop and mobile Web pages that were captured from search and online magazine websites. In half of the conditions, the Web pages were modified based on established Web design guidelines to improve the clarity of ad labeling. The participants' behavior, comments, and eye movements were recorded. Initial findings of this experiment are: (a) consumers cannot always distinguish ads, paid content, and paid search results from unpaid content, and (b) improving the salience and placement of labels based on established UI design guidelines can improve consumers' ability to recognize ads, paid content, and paid search results. We conclude with implications of the results and areas for future research.},

Given their highly personal nature, aesthetics and form factor play a key role in adoption and continued use, but thus far little work has focused on this. This paper presents a three-part study to better understand the role of aesthetics and personalisation within wearables. We provided 15 participants with customised, low-fidelity, non-functional "activity trackers", based on their own designs, for in the wild evaluation. Our participants' use of these prototypes provided us with insights into their feelings towards their existing commercial devices and their own designs alike. We found that aesthetics plays an important, and currently underappreciated, role in use and continued engagement, particularly when the context of use is considered. We suggest that manufacturers should embrace adaptability and DIY cultures, allowing end-users to customise their wearables and support them in appropriately choosing, and creating their own designs.},

This approach was implemented and tested in a field study with one of the assembly lines of an electronics manufacturing services (EMS)-company. 30 staff members were recruited as test subjects and 90% of them appreciated the system deployment, due to its noticeable additional benefits compared to the status quo.},

This paper presents insights around how teachers currently use physical manipulatives to inform future MR designs in the K-5 classroom. Manipulatives are physical objects used for teaching; Examples include, coins, blocks, puzzles markers etc. K-5 teachers have been using physical manipulatives to help illustrate abstract concepts for decades. Physical manipulatives have proven high value for students [7] and their high level of adoption by grade school teachers makes them a potential candidate for introducing MR into the classroom. In this research, we use participatory design, journey maps and interviews to identify teacher challenges with current physical manipulatives and explore potential design directions for MR manipulatives in the classroom. Our preliminary findings suggest that MR could help improve autonomy around student learning and increase opportunity for collaboration between peers, as well as between teacher and student.},

They reuse old scripts, adapt scripts from other teachers, and from online and physical sources.We derive implications for the design of scripting tools: sup-porting scripts at multiple levels of detail, or annotations for adjusting scripts during and after teaching sessions.},

However, when the native language of only a subset of students is used, it excludes others from participating in the conversation. The current study aims to understand when and why an exclusive native language will be used during communication at international courses. To do this, we conducted a 4-week diary study with 22 students taking the same class. These students come from 12 different countries but they all speak English as a common language. Through a preliminary analysis of the data, we extracted 4 scenarios where students chose their native language over English to conduct course related discussions.

abstract = {Cities are increasingly integrating urban technologies into their infrastructures to improve municipal services, civic engagement, and quality of life for residents. Research suggests that technologies implemented in communities can worsen existing inequalities, yet there is little understanding of what underserved residents think about urban technologies or how they engage with their cities about technology policies or practices. Based on two technology forums held in underserved communities, we found that residents are motivated to participate in city technology planning because they believe technology impacts the economic and social health of their communities and because they are wary of the city»s intentions behind certain urban technologies and policies. However, avenues for such engagement with the city were not accessible to our participants. We conclude that residents» participation in existing forms of governance poses an opportunity for city officials and those in underserved communities to collaboratively build urban technologies that benefit all.},

abstract = {Immigrants usually are pro-social towards their hometowns and try to improve them. However, the lack of trust in their government can drive immigrants to work individually. As a result, their pro-social activities are usually limited in impact and scope. This paper studies the interface factors that ease collaborations between immigrants and their home governments. We specifically focus on Mexican immigrants in the US who want to improve their rural communities. We identify that for Mexican immigrants having clear workflows of how their money flows and a sense of control over this workflow is important for collaborating with their government. Based on these findings, we create a blockchain based system for building trust between governments and immigrants.We finish by discussing design implications of our work and future directions.},

We found that while Uber and Lyft participate in the gig economy in almost identical ways, the difference in tone apparent through each platform's messaging could lead to conflicting experiences for drivers.

When such difficulties occur, individuals often rely on more knowledgeable users to overcome difficulties. However, many do not have a support network of knowledgeable individuals available. Moreover, some challenges go beyond the need for guidance, as for example difficulties in performing swipes for motor impaired people. In this paper, we propose Data Donors, a conceptual framework proposing the enablement of users with the capacity to help others to do so by donating their mobile interaction data and knowledge. Inspired by charitable donations, we outline the Data Donors framework and discuss three applications that are being developed under the data donning paradigm. Through this work, we will explore the consequences and opportunities of sharing ones' data for the greater good and discuss the creation of global data donation programs.},

Exoskeleton technology can assist older adults by providing additional support to compensate for age-related decline in muscle strength. To date little is known about the opinions and needs of older adults regarding exoskeletons as current research primarily focuses on the technical development of exoskeleton devices. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to inform the design of exoskeletons from a human-centered perspective. Interviews were conducted with seven older adults and six healthcare professionals. Results indicated that exoskeletons can be a valuable addition to existing mobility devices. Accepting the need for mobility aids was found to be challenging due to associated stigmas. Therefore, an exoskeleton with a discreet appearance was preferred. Ultimately, the willingness to use exoskeleton technology will depend on personal needs and preferences.},

However, existing interactive budgeting apps neither support this transition, nor facilitate long-term financial planning. Our research aims to understand OAs' technological, educational, and behavioural barriers toward the adoption of budgeting applications. It also aims to uncover the design requirements for long-term financial planning apps that would overcome these adoption barriers. For this, we conducted a contextual inquiry to understand seniors' financial management practices. In-depth qualitative data collected both from individual sessions and participatory design activities has revealed significant gaps between the capabilities of existing apps; the best practices around long-term planning; and the attitudes and behaviours of OAs. We present here an argument, based on the preliminary analysis of the field data, for approaching the design of senior-centred interactive budgeting apps from a behavioural change and educational perspective.},

It automatically and continuously monitors the composition process in three dimensions (i.e., level of detail, overall valence, and cognitive engagement) and provides relevant feedback to support reflection. In a 24-subject pilot deployment, we found that such scaffolding and feedback could help users compose longer reflections with more positive emotion words as well as more insight and causal words. We discuss how the literature on emotional writing informed mirrorU's design, and highlight the major findings as well as the lessons learned from the pilot study.},

abstract = {Smart buildings generate a wealth of data about the spaces they contain. Yet, in evaluating them against occupant needs, sensor data alone is insufficient. Our contribution lies in a re-framing of smart building spaces around the human factor, and a critical lens on the criteria used to evaluate buildings. We propose future work on participatory technologies to evaluate complex and heterogeneous built environments with the people who live and work in them, recognising that their expertise is invaluable in creating quality spaces and ensuring their ongoing and sustainable use.},

abstract = {Zaatari, the world's largest Syrian refugee camp, currently hosts around 80,000 Syrian refugees. Located in the desert, the camp has become the fifth biggest city in Jordan. Previous examinations of crisis-housing in refugee camps have assessed re-appropriation of shelters in order to improve functionality. In this paper, we show how interior adornment serves a purpose in refugee lives that goes beyond that of functionality. Our analysis of fieldwork conducted in Zaatari camp show how decorating provides an escape from the camp and compensates for loss of identity, home and leisure. Within contexts of austerity, decorating spaces is a valuable and vital aspect of living, coping and supporting people's sense of identity and pride. Through painting and decorating both public and private 'spaces', refugees transform them into 'places', creating a sense of home. We highlight how the capability of decorating, crafting and making is an enactment of freedom within contexts of political restrictions and resource limitations.},

abstract = {When a group of citizens wants to tackle a social problem online, they need to discuss the problem, possible solutions, and concrete actions. Instant messengers are a common tool used in this setting, which support free and unstructured discussion. But tackling complex social problems often calls for structured discussion. In this paper, we present Micro-NGO, a chat-based online discussion platform with built-in support for (1) the problem-solving process and (2) the action planning process. To scaffold the process, Micro-NGO adopts a question prompting strategy, which asks relevant questions to users in each stage of the problem-solving process. Users can answer the questions and vote for the best answer while they freely discuss in the chat room. For an informal evaluation, we conducted a pilot study with two groups (n=7). The participants held a discussion while collectively answering the question prompts and reached consensus to send a petition letter about campus issues to the related personnel.},

In addition to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, there are countless organizations and nonprofits around the world focused on trying to facilitate this process and provide support where needed. This paper presents preliminary user research undertaken in Clarkston, Georgia (USA), to study the process. We used qualitative research methods including contextual analysis and semi-structured interviews to evaluate the ease of integration for refugees who have relocated to Clarkston.

The design of the AR system was based on and extends our prior tangible reading system called PhonoBlocks. In this paper, we discuss why and how we extend the work from PhonoBlocks to an AR system design. The goal of our system is to teach children explicit letter-sound correspondences. Two key design features of our system, which are different from other systems, are the use of augmented dynamic colour cues and 3D physical lowercase letters that help to draw children's attention to how letters' positions in words change letter sounds. Unlike our previous system, our AR system uses off-the-shelf technology so it can be easily scaled and distributed. We discuss the advantages and opportunities for our AR solution, and outline our future plans for evaluating this system.},

We introduce three emotional expression designs of VA, iconic facial expressions, a text box with body movements, and emotional voice waveforms. Our user study results show that a VA with an expressive face or text body movements can evoke stronger user engagement than the one with voice waveforms.},

Head-mounted or mobile eye tracking is an established tool to analyze the visual behavior of people. Since these systems usually require some kind of calibration prior to usage, a new generation of mobile eye tracking devices based on corneal imaging has been investigated. However, little attention has been given on how to analyze corneal imaging specific eye tracking data. A classic approach in state-of-the-art systems is to extract different eye movements (e.g., fixations, saccades and pursuits movements). So far, there is no approach for applying these methods to corneal imaging data. We present a proof-of-concept method for fixation extraction and clustering of corneal imaging data. With this method we can compress the eye tracking data and make it ready for further analysis (e.g., attention measurement and object detection).},

Using topic modelling and cross-correlation analysis of more than 3 million messages from 86 games of TI7, we uncover main topical and temporal patterns of communication. First, we disentangle contextual meanings of emotes and memes, which play a salient role in communication, and show a meta-topics semantic map of streaming slang. Second, our analysis shows a prevalence of the event-driven game communication during tournament broadcasts and particular topics associated with the event peaks. Third, we show that »copypasta» cascades and other related practices, while occupying a significant share of messages, are strongly associated with periods of lower in-game activity.},

Partial data analysis suggested a motivational threshold of gamification: game design elements don»t motivate the initiation of new use sessions per se, but are able to prolong an already started session. Some other pre-existing sought uses and gratifications are required for gamification to work, although gamification may indirectly support these. Main reasons for initiating use of a gamified learning platform were learning, curiosity, fun, need for closure, and competence.},

In response to this problem, technological solutions have been proposed, such as computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) and online peer to peer (P2P) support groups, which have been shown to be effective for non-severe cases of anxiety and depression, and can sometimes exceed the effectiveness on F2F therapy. However, P2P support is often viewed as inferior, and this perception has demotivated participation in existing cCBT P2P platforms by potential peers. To address this perception, we are designing a novel cCBT P2P game that uses gamification techniques to motivate players to participate as helping peers. Specifically, we are examining the Proteus Effect, which purports that a player will adopt qualities of their avatar in a contextual narrative.},

Video conferencing and similar online applications create great benefits bringing people who physically cannot spend as much time as they want virtually together.

We combine Augmented Reality and capacitive 3D printed objects that can be sensed on an interactive surface to enable remote interaction while providing the same tangible experience as in co-located scenarios. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a sample application based on the traditional chess game.},

Less explored is rapid and dynamic perspective changing that can introduce uncertainty for users concerning whether their feeds are manipulated, and if they are viewing themselves or another. We report on initial trials of a 3-person wireless headset system. Each headset incorporated an external video camera and an internal screen that provides its wearers with visual information. Camera transmissions are rapidly and automatically switched to be received by different headsets, thus providing wearers with a continuous cycling through 1st, 2nd and 3rd person perspectives. Based upon testing several physical games activities, we offer suggestions to assist developers in designing intense embodied perspective changing experiences.},

Building upon our prior work, we designed and implemented a new Q&amp;A interaction. Through conducting a field study and a follow-up survey of 47 graduate students, our research reveals gaps between a peer tutor's strategy (i.e., question position and knowledge type) and a learner's preference and answering effort. For example, compared to tutors, learners preferred that questions be inserted in the middle of the videos and that the answers to tacit knowledge-related questions be more numerous and longer than those for explicit knowledge-related questions. The design implications from our findings need to be incorporated into practice and into future research of online videos for peer tutor learning.},

However, current tools for prototyping smart jewelry do not put aesthetic considerations as a primary concern. Therefore, we created Snowflakes, a design speculation for a modular, "snap-on-off", prototyping tool for designing smart jewelry. The design requirements of Snowflakes were determined after studying non-smart jewelry and extracting 7 parameters for them (limb, material, grip, fastener type, decoration, decoration placement and form). Drawing upon these parameters, Snowflakes were proposed as a tool that would allow prototyping smart jewelry by synthesizing conventional jewelry's form language with smart jewelry which is adorned with technology. This paper explores using this product as a design tool to experiment on designs blending aesthetics and function.},

An experiment was administered to 15 seniors (over age of 65), in which the participants searched for information using a traditional keyboard/mouse interface and an experimental voice/touch interface. An analysis of the data collected showed that seniors perceive meaningful differences between the two interfaces in terms of learnability, usability, ease of understanding and helpfulness.},

We find that users' credibility judgments can be improved by the two augmentations, though the changes in credibility scores were not statistically significant. However, participants spent longer using the design that gave them control over the evaluation process, and appeared to be more confident about the choices they made using it - despite the fact that their judgments were actually less accurate. We outline directions for future work based on these findings.},

But, can this gentle nudge influence users to exhibit secure online account behaviors? And further, which of the nudge types is most effective? We conducted a between-subjects experiment with five conditions, plus a control, in which participants (n = 263) experienced different types of nudges (incentives, norms, default, salience, ego) before indicating their comfort levels with an auto-generated password and intentions to create a new password. Results show the salience nudge most effectively reduced one's comfort level with keeping the auto-generated password. These preliminary findings imply nudges using multiple psychological effects could serve as important design cues, thereby making intended behaviors easy to perform.},

Results mainly highlighted an apparent mismatch between participants' expectations (looking at the surroundings and walking safely) and prospective acceptability of the devices (map is preferred while requiring attention sharing). Thus, the relevance of the common acceptability criteria for prospective research about navigation aids and sensory wearables was discussed.},

abstract = {On the surface, task-completion should be easy in graphical user interface (GUI) settings. In practice however, different actions look alike and applications run in operating-system silos. Our aim within GUI action recognition and prediction is to help the user, at least in completing the tedious tasks that are largely repetitive. We propose a method that learns from a few user-performed demonstrations, and then predicts and finally performs the remaining actions in the task. For example, a user can send customized SMS messages to the first three contacts in a school's spreadsheet of parents; then our system loops the process, iterating through the remaining parents.First, our analysis system segments the demonstration into discrete loops, where each iteration usually included both intentional and accidental variations. Our technical innovation approach is a solution to the standing motif-finding optimization problem, but we also find visual patterns in those intentional variations. The second challenge is to predict subsequent GUI actions, extrapolating the patterns to allow our system to predict and perform the rest of a task. We validate our approach on a new database of GUI tasks, and show that our system usually (a) gleans what it needs from short user demonstrations, and (b) autocompletes tasks in diverse GUI situations.},

We then conducted remote, unmoderated usability studies and quantitative experiments. Our initial findings show that autoimport can solve the blank slate problem by getting users started quickly with the browser, but introduces issues related to perceived privacy and performance.

However, trackerless AR is only now becoming widely available to both users and developers, and there are few guidelines or conventions developers can reference for design heuristics. With the recent push for the creation of more AR apps from the two leading mobile platforms, there is a need to create new heuristic guidelines for user interactions with augmented reality user interfaces (UI). Our research compares and contrasts what could be called a traditional mobile UI, which consists of menu options appearing in screen space, and an AR interface, where the menu options are placed relative to the object they affect. There are recommendations for this type of interaction and starting with small scale tests like ours is the first step to solidifying an interface standard.},

abstract = {SweepScreen is a digital paintbrush enabling the printing of low-fidelity lasting free form images. It is made of a row of electromagnets that turn on and off in a specific pattern while the user sweeps across the magnetophoretic surface, thus producing a custom image. Despite being low fidelity (black &amp; white, static images), SweepScreen works on passive surfaces to create bistable images. It can therefore replace physical paper on notice boards, packaging or other labeling systems. It can also be used to fast prototype static free form displays to better understand interactions with new display form factors. This could be of interest for the shape-changing community which struggles to access manufactured free form displays. We present our concept and proof-of-concept prototypes that can print images on flat free form surfaces. We show the results of performance evaluations to test the viability of the device and finish with a discussion about current limitations.},

For instance, to purchase a bottle of water online, a user has to unlock the smartphone, find the right e-commerce app, search the name of the water product, and finally place an order. This procedure requires manual, often cumbersome, input of a user, but could be significantly simplified if the smartphone can identify an object and automatically process this routine. We present Knocker, an object identification technique that only uses commercial off-the-shelf smartphones. The basic idea of Knocker is to leverage a unique set of responses that occur when a user knocks on an object with a smartphone, which consist of the generated sound from the knock and the changes in accelerometer and gyroscope values. Knocker employs a machine learning classifier to identify an object from the knock responses. A user study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of Knocker with 14 objects in both quiet and noisy environments. The result shows that Knocker identifies objects with up to 99.7% accuracy.},

We also propose the ParaPara system, which applies this method. Most previously proposed systems convert real-world objects into 3D graphic models using expensive equipment; this is a barrier for individuals or small groups to create MR content. ParaPara uses four points in an image and their manually estimated distances to synthesize MR content by applying deep neural networks and simple image processing techniques to monocular videos. The synthesized content can be observed through an MR head-mounted display, and spatial mapping and spatial sound are applied to support the interaction between the real-world and MR content. The proposed system is expected to reduce the entry barriers to create MR content because it can create such content from a large number of previously captured videos.},

However, this approach tends to break the immersion of the user. In order to preserve the immersion and the suspension of disbelief, we propose to adapt the method of notification to the current situation of the user in the IVE and the messages' priority. We propose the concept of adaptive and immersive notifications in VR and introduce an open-source framework which implements our approach. The framework aims to serve as an easy-to-extend code base for developers of everyday VR applications. As an example, we implemented a messaging application that can be used by a non-immersed person to send text messages to an immersed user.

abstract = {This paper presents the ongoing development of a proof-of-concept, adaptive system that uses a neurocognitive signal to facilitate efficient performance in a Virtual Reality visual search task. The Levity system measures and interactively adjusts the display of a visual array during a visual search task based on the user's level of cognitive load, measured with a 16-channel EEG device. Future developments will validate the system and evaluate its ability to improve search efficiency by detecting and adapting to a user's cognitive demands.},

The proposed interface offers users a small set of object cues generated automatically tailored to the context of a given video. Users choose which cue to highlight, and the interface in turn fast-forwards the video adaptively while keeping scenes with highlighted cues played at original speed. Our experimental results have revealed that the DO-Scanning arranged an efficient and compact set of cues, and this set of cues is useful for browsing a diverse set of first-person videos.},

abstract = {As information technologies (IT) are both, drivers of highly engaging experiences and sources of disruptions at work, the phenomenon of flow - defined as "the holistic sensation that people feel when they act with total involvement" [5, p. 36] - has been suggested as promising vehicle to understand and enhance user behavior. Despite the growing relevance of flow at work, contemporary measurement approaches of flow are of subjective and retrospective nature, limiting our possibilities to investigate and support flow in a reliable and timely manner. Hence, we require objective and real-time classification of flow. To address this issue, this article combines recent theoretical considerations from psychology and experimental research on the physiology of flow with machine learning (ML). The overall aim is to build classifiers to distinguish flow states (i.e., low and high flow). Our results indicate that flow-classifiers can be derived from physiological signals. Cardiac features seem to play an important role in this process resulting in an accuracy of 72.3%. Hereby, our findings may serve as foundation for future work aiming to build flow-aware IT-systems.},

abstract = {With the advent of decentralised energy resources (DERs), there has been increased pressure on classic grid infrastructure to manage non-dispatchable resources. In face of these challenges, microgrids provide a new way of managing and distributing DERs and are characterised as core building blocks of smart grids. In this context blockchain technology enables transaction-based systems for keeping track of energy flows in between producing and consuming parties. However, such systems are not intuitive and introduce challenges for the user»s understanding. In our current work, we introduce a user-centric approach to utilise a transactional data structure, providing transparency and understanding for when and from where electric energy is consumed. We present our approach for an engaging user interface and a preliminary study with feedback from solar installation owners and close with remarks on our future research plans.},

abstract = {Estimating mental workload from brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG) has proven very promising in multiple Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications, e.g., to design games or educational applications with adaptive difficulty, or to assess how cognitively difficult to use an interface can be. However, current EEG-based workload estimation may not be robust enough for some practical applications. Indeed, the currently obtained workload classification accuracies are relatively low, making the resulting estimations not fully trustable. This paper thus studies promising modern machine learning algorithms, including Riemannian geometry-based methods and Deep Learning, to estimate workload from EEG signals. We study them with both user-specific and user-independent calibration, to go towards calibration-free systems. Our results suggested that a shallow Convolutional Neural Network obtained the best performance in both conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the used data sets. This suggests that Deep Learning can bring new possibilities in HCI.},

Pupil dilation has recently attracted attention in the HCI community as an indicator for mental workload. The impact of mental workload on pupillary behavior has been extensively examined. However, systems making use of these measurements to alleviate mental workload have been scarcely evaluated. Our work investigates the expediency of task complexity adaption based on pupillary data in real-time. By conducting math tasks with different complexities, we calibrate a complexity adjustment system. In a pilot study (N=6), we evaluate the feasibility of changing task complexity using two different complexities. Our findings show less perceived mental workload during task complexity adaptation compared to presenting high task complexities only. We show the potential of pupil dilation as a valid metric for assessing mental workload as a modality for cognition-aware user interfaces.},

Social MatchUP is a simple Concentration-like game, run on smartphones, where players should communicate to match up all the pairs of images they are given. Because every player can only interact with half of the pictures, but can see what his companion is doing, the game improves social and communication skill, and can be used also as a learning tool. A simple and easy-to-use customization tool was also developed to let therapists and teachers adapt the game context to the needs of the children they take care of.},

Also, we surveyed the acceptability of receiving feedback in different locations on the body. Participants noted an overall higher accuracy on the upper and sides of the torso and they generally disfavored haptic feedback in sensitive areas due to potential harm.

To address this, expressive lights are considered to be an effective means for such robots to communicate with people. However, existing studies mainly focus on specific tasks or goals, leaving the knowledge of how expressive lights affect people's perception still unknown. In this pilot study, we investigate such a question by using a Roomba robot. We designed two light expressions, namely, green and low-intensity (GL) and red and high-intensity (RH). We used open-ended questions to evaluate people's perception and interpretation of the robot, which showed different light expressions as a way to communicate. Our findings reveal that simple light expressions can allow people to construct rich and complex interpretations of a robot's behavior, and such interpretations are heavily biased by the design of expressive lights.},

abstract = {Previsualization (previs) is an essential phase in the design process of narrative media such as film, animation, and stage plays. Digital previs can involve complex technical tasks, e.g. 3D scene creation, animation, and camera work, which require trained skills that are not available to all personnel involved in creative decisions for the production. Interaction techniques such as virtual reality (VR) enable users to interact with 3D content in a natural way compared to classical 2D interfaces. As a first step, we developed VR based prototypes and performed an exploratory user study to evaluate how non-technical professionals from the film, animation, and theater domain assess the use of VR for previs. Our results show that users were able to interact with complex 3D scenes after a short phase of familiarization and rated VR for previs as useful for their professional work.},

abstract = {Recently, voice-based intelligent agents (VIAs), such as Alexa, Siri, and Bixby, are becoming popular. One of the interaction challenges with VIAs is that it is difficult to deliver rich information, experience, and meaning via voice-only communication channels. We propose interactive thermal augmentation to address VIA's interaction challenges. We developed a prototype system and conducted a user study to investigate the effects of thermal interaction in a VIA interaction context. The preliminary study results revealed that: 1) the thermal interface helped the participants to understand the information better; 2) the integration of heat and sound sensation provided an immersive and engaging experience; 3) a thermal stimulus worked as an additional feedback channel that supplements the voice interface. We discuss potentials and considerations when adopting thermal interaction to enrich people's experiences with a VIA.},

This paper describes a deployment of fifteen Bluetooth-beacon-enabled 'creatures' spread across London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which initiate conversations on mobile phones in their vicinity via push notifications. Playing on the common assumption that neutral public settings promote anonymity, users' willingness to converse with personified chatbots is used as a proxy for understanding their inclination to share personal and potentially disclosing information. Each creature is linked to a conversational agent that asks for users' memories and their responses are then shared with other creatures in the network. This paper presents the design of an interactive device used to test users' awareness of how their information propagates to others.},

Communication with a substitute operator is tedious and error-prone if the operator does not have an equal level of professional experience and might interrupt the workflow. We present a sensor-integrated shoe allowing surgeons to browse and manipulate 2D medical image data by foot movement. It is portable and wearable. The shoe uses an optical sensor taken from an off-the-shelf computer mouse for tracking the foot movements and an additional micro-switch to turn it on or off. We evaluated the performance of the shoe interface against a control condition with assistant together with ten surgeons in an empirical user study. Our results provide first indications for the effectiveness of a shoe interface in this application area.},

We explore a solution where a conventional smartwatch, a device users already carry around with them, is used to enable short interactions but also allows for longer complex interactions with mobile VR. To explore the possibilities of a smartwatch for interaction, we conducted a user study in which we compared two variables with regard to user performance: interaction method (touchscreen vs inertial sensors) and wearing method (hand-held vs wrist-worn). We found that selection time and error rate were lowest when holding the smartwatch in one hand using its inertial sensors for interaction (hand-held).},

PairRing allows users to scroll up and down listed items by turning the ring on their index finger with their thumb. To determine the optimal ring shape and rotation speed, we designed and conducted a user study and report the results. We found that (1) users could perform tasks better with the angular ring prototype; (2) the rapid rotation speed was better suited for browsing ordered lists; and (3) overall, participants were positive about the feasibility of the prototype.

One factor, unique to conversational agents, that we need to account for as designers, is personality. People attribute personalities to conversational agents, strongly influenced by social expectations, whether or not a particular personality was designed deliberately. In the case of multi-lingual agents, this creates additional challenges: direct translations don't accommodate cultural variation. We discuss the design process and lessons learned from Radar Pace, a conversational coach that launched with support for five languages. We highlight successes and failures based on user study results and propose changes to the design process to avoid pitfalls for future agents.},

Due to costs in time and money, we are beginning to see a new form of tool interrogation that prioritizes scale, cost, and breadth by utilizing existing data from online forums. In this case study, we set out to apply this method of using online forum data to a specific issue---challenges that users face with Excel spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are a versatile and powerful processing tool if used properly. However, with versatility and power come errors, from both users and the software, which make using spreadsheets less effective. By scraping posts from the website Reddit, we collected a dataset of questions and complaints about Excel. Specifically, we explored and characterized the issues users were facing with spreadsheet software in general, and in particular, as resulting from a large amount of data in their spreadsheets. We discuss the implications of our findings on the design of next-generation spreadsheet software.},

To learn this technique, medical students traditionally practice on training mannequins under the guidance of a clinical instructor. The objective of this project was to co-develop a standardized augmented reality solution for teaching medical students this procedure, which would enable them to practice independently and at their own pace. Following an iterative design and prototyping process, we compiled a comprehensive set of usability heuristics specific to augmented reality healthcare applications, used to identify unique usability issues associated with augmented reality software. This approach offers a better strategy to improve the usability of augmented reality system and increases the potential to standardize and render medical education more accessible. The benefits of applying augmented reality to simulated medical education come with heavy consequences in the event of poor learning outcomes. The usability of these systems is paramount to ensure the development of clinical competence is facilitated and not hindered.},

abstract = {Engineering productivity has been a popular topic of discussion from both an employee and employer perspective. Through rigorous experimentation and multi-methods approach, alongside subjective responses, we saw significant improvements in our engineering system. This paper reflects over a year of learnings on methods to increase response rates and designing surveys for monitoring and impacting both efficiency and satisfaction for internal developers. Measuring these concepts became important as we were making significant changes to our engineering system. These methods can be applied in other contexts to increase response rates and monitor satisfaction overtime.},

abstract = {A key factor that a typical Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) demands of operators is concentration of mind. A focused mind is more effective in controlling a BCI. One way to improve mental concentration is meditation. Past studies have demonstrated the positive effect of long-term meditation (month-long to year-long) on BCI performance. In this study, we examined the impact of short-term meditation (10-15 minutes long). We explored two guided meditation techniques of mindfulness: 1) open monitoring, and 2) mindful breathing. A brain-controlled toy helicopter was used as a testbed. Five participants volunteered in the experiment in which they were exposed to an emotional stressor of a violent video gameplay followed by operating the helicopter through mental concentration. A brief meditation intervention was introduced between the video gameplay and the BCI task. The results reveal that, in comparison to the control trial, participants were able to lift the helicopter for longer time durations after meditation. Furthermore, this performance improvement was significantly greater than the participants achieved by sitting idle.},

This includes placing optional additional assignments in online courses. Learners solve these individual assignments, provide peer reviews for other learners, and give feedback on each review they receive. Based on these data points teams are selected to work on a final paid assignment. Companies offer these assignments and in return receive interview recommendations from the pool of learners together with solutions for their challenges. We report the results of a pilot deployment in an online programming course offered by UC BerkeleyX. Six learners out of 158 participants were selected for the paid group assignment paying $600 per person. Four of these six were invited for interviews at the participating companies Crowdbotics (2) and Telefonica Innovation Alpha (2).},

abstract = {This case study describes the creation of a head-mounted display virtual reality exergame program for promoting physical exercise for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), namely people with early-stage dementia. We engaged in an iterative participatory design process with kinesiologists, recreational therapists, and people with MCI prior to pilot-testing a prototype program with three persons with MCI. The test participants engaged in the exergame, were able to do the exercises, and their feedback was very positive. Engaging with professionals and people with dementia throughout the design process was very beneficial to creating a usable and engaging design as well as identifying areas that could be further improved. In conclusion, the approach illustrated through this case study resulted a new way for older adults with MCI to engage in physical activities that is fun and tailored to their abilities. The next phase in our research is to evaluate the exergame against comparable human-guided movements.},

abstract = {Insights from cultural dimensions can be translated into UI guidelines to make technology products locally relevant. Such design suggestions originate from academia but little insight exists in how this knowledge is being applied and tested with global industry products, indicating a gap between research and practice. We contribute two case studies, developed based on work experience and interviews with Product Owners for e-commerce localization in Booking.com and Managing Editors involved in the development for the AI Cortana, Microsoft's intelligent assistant, that provide insight into the efforts to develop or optimize a locally relevant product. These case studies contribute to the academic discussion of the use and usefulness of cultural dimensions by examining the value of existing academic research when applied in specific circumstances. We found that cultural dimensions are used for idea generation, to inform design interventions at a global scale, and to justify personal experiences and intuitions. We also found that designers in industry rely more on personal experiences and knowledge than on the use of cultural dimensions. We discuss the complexities of optimizing for local markets and how insights from the case studies can help to further close the gap between industry and research.},

The shoes are made with soft and flexible materials for dynamic fit and use. The shoes are not only uniquely formed to the user's feet but the geometry of the material is designed to support and flex with the movement of each foot. These shoes utilize a 4D printing approach in the way they are made to fit the user while they move and change. Designing a shoe to such a degree represents a form of Ultra Personalization. This case study of an ultra personalized approach addresses the negotiation of key design considerations: aesthetics, comfort, robustness, balance and temperature. The findings inform digital fabrication design, software, and tools for designers.},

As stakeholders call for technological innovation to address the realities of the global migration crisis, HCI researchers in and outside of academia engage with the issues faced by humanitarian responders, refugees and communities. Our exploratory study at UNHCR Za'atari Syrian Refugee Camp in Jordan highlights the creative ways young people co-opt technology to perform information work. We collected data through a survey, diaries, and observations. Findings offer important insights. First, hacking at Za'atari is highly gendered, with only boys observed engaging in the activity. Second, the range of young hackers' activities indicate the following: a) youth help their family and community through technology; b) benefits include getting paid and feeling empowered by their role of technology experts; and c) a connected learning environment emerges. Finally, the physical location where youth are co-opting technology is important in building capacity.},
