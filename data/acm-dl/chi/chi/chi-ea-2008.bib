We discuss how the solution evolved over time, and the generally high level of acceptance from users and volunteer experts. We include survey findings and usage data, which indicate that in spite of initial concerns that the experts would be overwhelmed by questions, usage has been fairly low and relatively flat. We examine this phenomenon and conclude with a discussion of lessons learned.},

abstract = {This case study takes a close look at what novice designers discursively use as evidence to support design decisions. User-centered design has suggested that all design decisions should be made with the concern for the user at the forefront, and, ideally, this concern should be represented by findings discovered within user-centered research. However, the data from a 12-month longitudinal study suggests that although these novice designers are well-versed with user-centered design theory, in practice they routinely do not use user-centered research findings to defend their design decisions. Instead these novice designers use less definitive and more designer-centered forms of evidence. This move away from the user, though perhaps unintentional, may suggest that design pedagogy may need to be re-evaluated to ensure that novice designers continue to adhere to the implications of user-centered research throughout the design process.},

Rationales for role playing in design are: communication within the design process, the increase of technological complexity, the experience and empathy of designers, the tangibility of interaction, and attentiveness to social change. These rationales inform our inclusion of role playing techniques in design education. Our aim is that the students can and do incorporate the techniques into their own design activity. Here, we focus on three questions: : 1. whether the techniques helped the students understand and question interaction, 2. whether the techniques helped students in ideation, and 3. whether the role playing exercises inspired students to use the techniques in own work. We identify several ways in which the techniques are effective for the students in their design work.},

Virtual collaboration systems are complex and can be considered as social-technical systems, oftentimes encompassing several layers of both technical and social issues. If this multi-layered social-technical system is to work effectively and provide a dependable service, then all the layers must be well understood and structured accordingly. Otherwise, these layers can become barriers to virtual collaboration if they impede the collaborating users of a virtual team from attaining their goals. An amalgamation of principles from life-cycle and ethnomethodologically informed ethnography approaches in the evaluation of a virtual collaborative system is demonstrated in a case-study to enable researchers to understand what these issues are and how the different types of issues can prevent effective virtual collaboration.},

abstract = {One of the biggest struggles user experience teams face is breaking through traditional notions of product strategy, planning and development to bring actionable awareness to the bigger picture around delivering full experiences that people really care about. User research and design is often focused around product &amp; feature design in a space that is defined by out-dated boundaries imposed by history or pre-existing constraints. Research is used to create new features or product direction within these walls, and many design tools are employed to ensure the experience delivered is acceptable. This paper uses a case study of a project titled "Healthy Technology" to highlight the important role that metaphors can play in shifting conversations &amp; strategy, from executive managers to development teams, leading to new boundaries, new strategies, a fresh look at what it means to set direction that targets complete user experiences rather than consumer appreciated features. The metaphor is discussed, through example, as more than a tool for user interface design, exploring the same as a means to alter strategic thinking in upper management as well as guide design and development teams in rethinking notions of technology to create new categories, rethink the problem space and to think beyond features. This paper outlines the research processes that lead to the creation of a metaphor and the functions of the metaphor in overcoming traditional boundaries and thinking. It describes key challenges and methods in this process of moving from research to strategic initiatives that fundamentally shift thinking, providing direction for business models, services, technologies, and industry alignment that come together to provide more than just features or products.},

abstract = {We examine the broad challenges facing a computer-based system to help match low-income domestic workers from an urban slum with potential middle-class employers in Bangalore, India. Due to the near impossibility of implementing such a system in one shot, we first implemented a paper-based system that provides the intended functionality but without a computer. This system proved a significant challenge in itself, and among the lessons learned are the crucial role of human intermediaries (necessary even in the final computer-based system), the importance of building skills among the domestic workers, the need for a strong value proposition for both employers and employees well above existing systems, and the requirement of technological literacy. We then show that these lessons are applicable to other scenarios where computing technology is applied to developing-world challenges, by analyzing corresponding issues in related work.   Our broad conclusion is that computer-based systems to solve developing-world problems often require significant work above and beyond an implementation of the technology, with trustworthy human intermediaries playing a critical role. },

In addition, we tried to make the system at low cost.In the spring of 2007, we made some preliminary system tests followed by an experiment in an actual station. As a result, we learned what the critical conditions for the next implementation should be. The IT scarecrow is consulted as a representative of communication between a railway and a local community.

We wanted to explore how this combination of features would help users manage and organize their email. We conducted a limited field test of the prototype by observing how users triage their own email using bluemail. Our study identified ways in which users liked tagging, threading, and foldering capabilities, but also some of the complex ways in which they can interact. Our study elicited early user input to guide the iterative design of these features. It also involved a user study researcher, designer, and developer in the field test to quickly integrate different perspectives during development.},

Several studies have shown HE-Plus, an emerging variant of HE, to outperform HE in both effectiveness and reliability. HE-Plus uses the same set of heuristics as HE; the only difference between these two methods is the 'usability problems profile' element in HE-Plus. This paper reports our attempt to verify the original profile employed in HE-Plus based on usability problem classification in the User Action Framework and an experiment evaluating its outcome by comparing HE with two HE variants using a profile (HE-Plus and HE++) and a control group. Our results confirmed the role of the 'usability problems profiles' on improving the performance and reliability of heuristic evaluation: both HE-Plus and HE++ outperformed HE in terms of effectiveness as well as reliability.},

abstract = {User Experience evangelism inside an organization is a frequent topic. Methods for marketing user centered design to internal stakeholders have been analyzed in many papers and on panels. Emerging media and new venues have recently presented an opportunity to reexamine methods and goals for external user experience marketing and evangelism. This interactive panel will address motivations and brainstorm about discount methods for promoting the role of the human factors profession to the general public, and communicating directly with the end users. This will be contrasted with the position that a well designed product should market itself, and that money is best spent on design and internal evangelism instead.The panel itself will involve 3 parts: 1. Moderator collecting answers to the "What would you do with a 1 million dollar UX marketing budget?" question via index cards. 2. Four panelists presenting short sales pitch proposing what they would do when faced with the same question. 3. Panel discussion focusing on the contributions from the audience and focused on producing two lists. One would include specific user experience marketing venues (targeted bloggers, un-conferences, think tanks, specific ad words, design-friendly printed publications like Business Week, etc.). The second list would focus on goals and of user experience marketing (raising awareness and promoting better image of user experience vs. engineering and other disciplines, increased sales, better brand, recruiting, swaying executives, etc.). The panel would continue to live after external publication of the two lists, with new blog installments, comments, and any subsequent and open discussions.},

However what is precisely meant by consistency and to what level this consistency should be attained is open for debate.Moreover, user interface designers and developers ignore standards since they assume that complying with standards stifles design innovation. The lack of understanding on what are standards and how they can be effectively applied, results in unnecessarily complicated user interface designs and dissatisfied users.This panel discusses how there is still much room for design innovation after applying appropriate user interface standards and how application designers can contribute to the creation of standards.},

abstract = {People use a wide range of intensity when interacting with artifacts and one another, spanning from subtle to brute force. However, computer interfaces so far have mainly focused on interactions restrained to limited force and do not consider extreme physical and brutal interactions, such as those encountered in contact sports. We present an interactive demonstrator that aims to facilitate "Brute Force" activities to aid designers who want to leverage the physical and mental health benefits of such forceful interactions. Our prototype demonstrates that augmenting Brute Force with computing technology can be beneficial: unlike traditional contact sports experiences, it supports distributed participants. Our aim is to encourage designers to extend their supported interactions to include extreme forceful behaviors, which can contribute to general fitness and weight loss while at the same time allowing socializing in an entertaining sportive way.},

Therefore, the user can explore the phone's status by touching it -- ambiently, even through the pocket. Initial user testing showed that this form of tactile interaction was easy to understand and handy to interact with, also for unexperienced users.},

The table runs a speaker independent speech recognition engine, based on a very small vocabulary, that is invoked only in specific circumstances. RFID tagged objects are used to populate the interface with contents, activate functions and authenticate users. Due to its analytical nature (high resolution and multi-point gestures), the table in the public space is used mostly as a form of digital mediation between two or more persons (e.g. consultant and customer): the expert can lead the novice through the more complex and less intuitive dynamics of interaction. We provide the SensitiveTable as an example of analytical natural interaction.},

We present the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of Spyn, a system for knitters to virtually weave stories into their creations. Using Spyn, a knitter can record, playback and share information involved in the creation of hand-knit products. Spyn uses patterns of infrared ink printed on yarn in combination with computer vision techniques to correlate locations in knit fabric with events recorded during the knitting process. Using Spyn, knitters can capture their activities as audio, image, video, and spatio-temporal data. When users photograph the knit material, the Spyn system analyzes the ink patterns on the material and visualizes events over the photograph of the knit. In the design of Spyn, we investigate the role that technology can play in preserving and sharing the handcraft process over space and time.},

In this demonstration we present a tangible user interface called iCandy that restores the benefits of physical albums for the electronic music in the iTunes multimedia application and provides a method for easy access to recorded media.

abstract = {The power of users playing the roles of authors and editors is undeniable these days [1]. New media, not only the Internet, are enabling people to become active users related to content production and sharing, and in co-creation of User Generated Content (UGC). In particular younger users and heavy users of Internet use networked applications to create and share content [1]. There is a need for UGC applications targeting a broader market, including older users and average Internet users. Today, the knowledge in designing and building for co-creation in networked media is still rather weak. The lack of information about UGC characteristics makes it difficult to expect what kind and amount of content will be produced, and to understand and interpret the reasons why users and user communities arise or fail. A significant effort is currently made by the HCI community in order to support active user involvement into the design and evaluation of networked applications [6]. Non-professional users are encouraged to become active producers and designers themselves [1]. However, there is still the need to explore how to apply and further extend these approaches and methods to better understand, design for and evaluate UGC applications. This SIG will contribute to this discussion by actively involving the audience in UGC creation.},

abstract = {User experience (UX) is still an elusive notion with many different definitions, despite some recent attempts to develop a unified view on UX. The lack of a shared definition of UX not only confuses or even misleads customers of a product/service but also undermines the effectiveness of researching, managing and teaching UX. Diverse ideas have been generated in scientific activities that aim to develop a common understanding about the meaning and scope of UX. It is plausible, with sound methodologies, to converge these divergences, driving the UX community closer to a common definition and integrated views of UX. This SIG tackles this challenge by systematically assembling a set of existing definitions and viewpoints of UX and collecting opinions on them from known UX experts/researchers and general CHI'08 attendees.},

It is firstly conceived as a biometric device which is initially imprinted with the fixed biometric properties of its owner, and is then regularly updated with the fluid biometric properties of its owner. However it also acts as an electronic pet which (i) part-shares identity with its owner, (ii) needs nurturing and (iii) effectively dies when separated from its owner for any length of time. Our proposal was inspired by the literary daemons described by Philip Pullman. Our Biometric Daemon synthesizes the properties of biometric token and daemon and we argue that it offers the basis for secure, usable and engaging identification and authentication.},

As HCI's fourth decade approaches, we re-examine the origins and status of Gould and Lewis' principles, and argue that is time to move on, not least because the role of the principles in reported case studies is unconvincing. Few, if any, examples of successful application of the first or second principles are offered, and examples of the third tell us little about the nature of successful iteration. More credible, better grounded and more appropriate principles are needed. We need not so much to start again, but to start for the first time, and argue from first principles for apt principles for designing.},

The insight gleaned from such explorations can then be applied to future work in which the crafting of a particular experience is desired.

This is based on our work with role playing in design education, design research and design work. It is also based on our background in both observational research and interaction design. Reading an interaction is not straightforward. Presenting an interaction is not, either. In this presentation, a very small interaction is presented in several different ways. The audience is invited to guess and discuss about the readability of this interaction and about the consequences of the possible readings for design.},

abstract = {Collaborative software tools are designed to support users in individual and group efforts to engage in complex tasks and/or to acquire and develop complex cognitive skills. The aim is to help users by alleviating or lessening the burden of complexity or even to hide or veil the complexity inherent in these tasks and skills. These embedded design structures act as scaffolds to provide support and laddering for users' attempts at climbing through, or mastering, skills and tool use. Tools whose scaffolds and structures fail to support and/or mediate collaborative interactions and exchanges become "unhelpful helpers". Unhelpful helpers stifle, hinder, and sometimes inhibit the collaborative interactions they were designed to support. Through the use of both metaphysical and natural representations of scaffolding and collaborative interactions, we examine the emergence of unhelpful helping as a by-product, in particular, of the design of scaffolding in collaborative tools. We argue that collaborative tools should be designed with a realistic and deep understanding of the context and practices in which they will be used. Furthermore, we argue that special attention and care should be given to the design of scaffolding structures to ensure that they support and help collaborative interactions and exchanges in ways they were intended.},

With this approach, users can select any commands by using "continuous keyword input," a voice input method using a series of keywords related to the command. Keywords are defined by a hierarchically structured command set, called the "functional structure." Two kinds of interactions are designed to support user-friendliness and effectiveness: interaction for exploration and interaction for the resolution of ambiguity. A probabilistic formulation for this approach is also considered. An experiment and objective evaluation method are designed so that the new interface for command execution can be compared with the conventional "command and control" interface. A comparative experiment to measure the efficiency and usability is also conducted and reported in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to the conventional approach from both objective and subjective points of view.},

abstract = {To date, research exploring interpersonal technology-mediated interruptions has focused on understanding how knowledge of an "interruptee's-local-context" can be utilized to reduce unwanted intrusions. However, the value of everyday interruptions are strongly tied to interrupter-interruptee relationships, interrupter's context and interruption content that we refer to as the 'relational context'. This suggests that a fresh approach to interruptibility research is needed that focuses on understanding how the knowledge of this relational context can be used to improve interruption management decisions. To address this concern a theoretical framework and associated research program are presented. The validity of fundamental aspects of this framework is then demonstrated through a study of cell phone call handling decisions. It shows that "who" is calling is used most of the time (87.4%) by individuals to make call handling decisions (N=834) unlike the interruptee's current local social (34.9%) or cognitive (43%) contexts. In addition, a clear disconnect was shown between the influence of local interrupee-context and relational context in terms of call handling decisions, suggesting that interruption management systems that focus only on an interruptee's-local-context will be ineffective. An alternative design approach is described to address these short comings.},

This research explores how to support everyday people through the challenges of narrative composition with photographs by leveraging everyday photo practices to make storytelling with photos easier. It is also concerned with providing a satisfying experience to authors and audiences alike.},

abstract = {Non-verbal behavior, particularly gaze, is a crucial part of human communication. To interact with humans in a rich, natural way, social interfaces need to use this communicative channel effectively. While the role and mechanics of human gaze are extensively studied, how gaze might be used effectively by embodied interfaces is not well explored. The goal of my dissertation is to gain a deeper understanding of how gaze behavior affects people's interactions with embodied social interfaces and how we can design gaze for effective communication. This research focuses on four main social functions of gaze: Regulation, Expression, Establishing Joint Attention, and Initiating/Avoiding of Social Encounters and four sets of design variables: Temporal, Spatial, Physiological, and Contextual. A systematic study of how these functions and design variables affect each other is conducted through a series of empirical studies.},

We used different analytic techniques to quantify any differences that exist in the networks of friends of older people and teenagers. Content analysis was applied to investigate age-related differences concerning the way users represent themselves on their profile pages. Our findings show that teenagers tend to have much larger networks of friends compared to older users. Also, we found that the majority of teenage users' friends are in their own age range (age +/- 2 years), whilst older people's friends tend to have a more diverse age distribution.},

Understanding how we process information over a wide FOV is increasingly important to optimize interface design. So far, however, empirical investigations are scarce. We present an experimental paradigm and framework for research with large displays and we report a preliminary experiment that explores attentional performance over a wide FOV. The paradigm simulates aspects of tasks that are facilitated by large displays. Our data suggest that processing abilities in the center and periphery are similar only if distractors are not present. With distractors, peripheral processing is disrupted and performance is poorer than in the center. In general, both accuracy and speed decline if the user must process information simultaneously in both areas. We discuss the implications for interface design, and describe further work that we are planning within this framework.},

Proxy targets effectively bring the target to the cursor, thereby reducing the distance that the cursor must travel. This paper describes a study which aims to provide an initial understanding of how older adults respond to proxy targets, and compares older with younger users. We found that users in both age groups adjusted to the proxy targets without difficulty, and there was no indication in the cursor trajectories that users were confused about which target, i.e. the original versus the proxy, was to be selected. In terms of times, preliminary results show that for younger users, proxies did not provide any benefits over direct selection, while for older users, times were increased with proxy targets. A full analysis of the movement times, error rates, throughput and subjective feedback is currently underway.},

abstract = {Despite the large number of patent searches conducted by professional patent searchers and inventors, little is known about how such searches are actually performed. Here we describe a qualitative study of experienced patent searchers as they conducted in-context searches at a technology transfer office. Based on studies of expert search and sensemaking in other domains, we expected the professional searchers to (1) use well-formed search strategies that were effective for patent search, and (2) rapidly make sense of the novelty of an invention by constructing new representations to organize existing patents that appear relevant. Instead, we observed the searchers perform simplistic preliminary searches and then exchange their search process and results with inventors and patent lawyers to collaboratively make sense of the patentability and licensability of the invention. Furthermore, their sensemaking consisted of selecting known representations of patents to organize the new information, an approach we call "weak" sensemaking. These results suggest implications for designing systems that support the observed collaborative "weak" sensemaking with the goal of helping the users to more effectively determine the patentability and licensability of an invention.},

abstract = {People on the autistic spectrum often have difficulties with social interaction, and these difficulties are compounded when a person faces the uncertainty of not knowing what to expect in a new social setting. Detailed, step-by-step explanations of people's intentions and plausible actions can often help autistic people make sense of the situation, adapt to the social rules, and reduce stress associated with the social encounter. Carol Gray's Social Stories? are carefully structured stories designed to prepare autistic people for everyday situations such as smiling at friends, waiting in a line, and staying calm in an audience when the speaker's slides don't match the handouts. Teachers or parents writing these stories often forget to include explanations of simple, "common sense" facts and simple variations of the story that might occur in different circumstances. We present a new tool that helps the writer explain salient points and think of more variations of the story. It uses a knowledge base of Common Sense sentences, Open Mind Common Sense, and inference in a semantic network, ConceptNet. We are investigating whether this new tool's suggestions are useful by examining how often the writers choose and use the suggestions that it generates.},

abstract = {We present a public interactive media installation, "Wish Spark" that evokes people's participation, sharing and giving. Different from art-based interactive media installation, Wish Spark has a practical feature; an aid for making donation a pleasurable, meaningful, and interactive activity. Our main concept is to make a system that appeals donation behavior as an act of fun not as a buggy activity, and finally lead people to make freewill contribution for society. This paper presents design process on how to make synergic effect of charitable giving as well as makes people have fun together. The act of throwing coin into the fountain was found to be a powerful and traditional way of making donation, thus it was used as a main metaphor for our solution. When people throw coins with their wish into Wish Spark, light and sound expressions occur to create a pleasurable user experience. The corrected coins are represented as people's wishes. Wish Spark is suggested to install in the landing gate of the airport because people can easily have a chance to give donation with small effort. In this project, we suggest a possibility to extend the social value of media installation by introducing interaction design process between human and public environment.},

abstract = {There are currently 1 billion overweight adults in the world according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Being overweight can pose a major risk to the health of an individual. The main reason for the increase in obesity in the West is the large changes in society, for example, our work and our leisure pursuits are becoming increasingly less physically demanding. One of the main ways that, according to the WHO, an individual can combat this is to undertake 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day. However, it can be difficult for a person to gauge this moderate physical activity. This paper describes the design of a prototype system which collects and subsequently combines data from an activity monitor and GPS device in order to help people to examine their activity patterns. The intention is that the integrated system will provide data to the user and others that will enable them to assess the effectiveness of attempts to increase activity and indicate where barriers to increased activity may exist, particularly those caused by the external environment.},

abstract = {In this paper we report on our work to develop a novel input technique for a digital paint system. Using a brush with infrared (IR) light emitting fibers, we were able to create a natural paint interface on an interactive table. This IR-brush adds two important properties to our paint environment: haptic feedback and an accurate brush footprint. The modified brush approaches the haptic feedback of the traditional paint brush. The use of IR-light in the brush enables tracking the contact area of the brush on the interactive table. Informal usability tests show that our digital paint environment offers an intuitive interface and contributes to an enhanced user experience in digital painting.},

abstract = {Advances in technology continually increase the ability, but also the complexity of consumer electronics. This is especially true when several devices must be configured to work together, such as a digital TV and satellite box. Manufacturers of consumer electronics attempt to remedy this by designing interfaces that consolidate multiple, complex user interfaces into a single, simple interface. However, the problem remains that end-users are still expected to configure and learn to operate these new interfaces on their own.This paper addresses the problem by proposing a radically new goal in terms of user interfaces for in-home, networked consumer electronics. Instead of trying and failing to make interfaces simple enough for everyone to use, we propose making interfaces that allow a "technology lead" - the person in the family responsible for supporting the technology-to more easily administer devices in his or her own home and in the homes of other family members. In Japan, where this study is taking place, user-centered research methods show that families usually have a single technology lead who is challenged with supporting people remotely in several homes. By enabling the technology lead to remotely support family members at a distance, the natural family dynamic can be used to support users who either find the new breed of consumer electronics too difficult to learn or do not wish to invest the time to learn how they work.},

abstract = {Tourism provides over six percent of the world's gross domestic product. As a result, there have been many efforts to use technology to improve the tourist's experience via mobile tour guide systems. One key bottleneck in such location-based systems is content development; existing systems either provide trivial information at a global scale or present quality narratives but at an extremely local scale. The primary reason for this dichotomy is that, although good narrative content is more educationally effective (and more entertaining) than a stream of simple, disconnected facts, it is time-intensive and expensive to develop. However, the WikEar system uses narrative theory-informed data mining methodologies in an effort to produce high-quality narrative content for any location on Earth. It allows tourists to interact with these narratives using their camera-enabled cell phones and an innovative interface designed around a magic lens and paper map metaphor. In this paper, we describe a first evaluation of these narratives and the WikEar interface, which reported promising, but not conclusive, results. We also present ideas for future work that will use this feedback to improve the narratives.},

Results indicate that people generally agree on the relative annoyance levels of visual reminders, and further, in certain contexts, more "annoying" or intrusive reminder styles are preferred. However, while there are some overarching patterns of agreement about the contexts in which certain types of reminders are preferable, preliminary evaluation also indicates that there are significant differences among people's preferences for specific visual reminders. This motivates the design and development of adaptive reminding systems that learn their users' individual preferences.},

abstract = {Websites and technologies that promote sustainable behavior often employ direct persuasion by being open about persuasive intent. We examined the use of indirect persuasion, methods that do not make persuasive intent clear. We built two variants of a recipe website designed to induce changes in users: one using direct persuasion and the other using indirect methods. We measured the effects of each site on users' attitudes and actions towards the environment. Preliminary results show that the direct style influenced actions while the indirect style influenced attitudes. We discuss the implications of this dissociation for research and applications.},

abstract = {Sketch recognition techniques have generally fallen into two camps. Gesture-based techniques, such as those used by the Palm Pilot's Graffiti, can provide high-accuracy, but require the user to learn a particular drawing style in order for shapes to be recognized. Free-sketch recognition allows users to draw shapes as they would naturally, but most current techniques have low accuracies or require significant domain-level tweaking to make them usable. Our goal is to recognize free-hand sketches with high accuracy by developing generalized techniques that work for a variety of domains, including design and education. This is a work-in-progress, but we have made significant advancements toward our over-arching goal.},

abstract = {This paper presents an ongoing observational study to explore a "front-stage-back-stage" model of information processes during group discussions (multidiscipli-nary rounds) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of an academic medical center. Participants were observed to collaborate on "front-stage" processes of case presentation, discussion of issues, and treatment planning, while in parallel they performed "back-stage" in-formation activities. The front-stage and backstage information processes were interdependent to address the need for fluid, highly time-pressured discourse with potential life-and-death consequences. We believe the front-stage-back-stage model adds to our understanding of collaborative information exchange and holds implications for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems. For example, computing support may increase the efficiency and reliability of information transfer by enhancing the ability to "choreograph" front-stage and back-stage information processes during critical discourse such as medical rounds.},

abstract = {In recent decades, families in the Western world have become more geographically distributed, making it more difficult for family members to achieve and maintain a feeling of connectedness. Different time zones and contexts and a limited awareness of the other family members' availability and mood are some of many factors that make "being together" more challenging when physically apart. Besides, when it comes to preschool children, existing communication technologies, such as phones and computers, may not even be an option. As a result, many families simply accept the fact that being apart leads to fragmented, or even non-existent, interaction. In this paper we describe initial work on a tangible system, Globetoddler, which aims to make remote interaction between preschool children and their traveling parents easy and enjoyable. The paper describes the process of defining design principles for this system, as well as the content and implications of these principles.},

Overall, simple gestures were preferred over more complex ones, and dimensions of gestures such as duration, force and direction have an impact on participants' evaluations. Some gestures also evoked similar associations among them. Our results suggest that user preferences and associations should be carefully considered when mapping gestures to system commands.},

The results show three dimensions of cultural difference for typical social networking behaviors: the users' goals, typical pattern of self expression, and common interaction behaviors. These differences exemplify a developmental path of interest in social networking and the gradual integration of social networking behavior into more general communications behaviors. Future work in other cultures and with additional methods will evaluate the hypotheses presented here.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report the design and evaluation of a Japanese text input method called IToNe. It uses a dual joystick game controller to input Japanese text. The left and right joysticks are respectively assigned to the left and right halves of the Japanese syllabary chart. The combination of left and right joystick signals selects a character. IToNe is theoretically faster than the Japanese selection chart. Results of a preliminary user study show that users prefer IToNe to EGCONVERT: its smoothness during operation and accuracy measures are significantly higher. In addition, the learning curve of IToNe suggests that it can be learned easily and that it potentially provides higher performance.},

After extensive analyses and pilot testing, two variations were chosen for initial evaluation. Method 1 (M1) uses the mouse alone to enter text. Method 4 (M4) also uses the keyboard to access vowels. In a study with seven blindfolded participants, entry rates averaged 2.9 wpm for M1 and 4.4 wpm for M4. Error rates for both methods were about 3.4%.},

As a result, web developers have begun to experiment with mashups - software applications that merge separate APIs and data sources into one integrated interface. Because the APIs and data sources are publicly available, in principle anyone can create a mashup. However, because relatively advanced programming languages are required to integrate these APIs, creating a mashup still requires considerable programming expertise. In this paper we share the results of an exploratory study of web developers and their experiences with building mashups. We profile the characteristics of mashup developers, examine the mashups they create, and the reasons they create mashups. From the results of this initial survey we outline a course for future research.},

abstract = {Game Approachability Principles (GAP) is proposed as a set of useful guidelines for game designers to create better tutorials, or first learning levels-especially for the casual gamer. Developing better first learning levels can be a key step to ease the casual gamer into play and to do so proactively-before it is too costly or cumbersome to restructure the tutorials to be more effective. Thus, Game Approachability in the context of game development is defined as making games initially more friendly and accessible for players who have the desire to play, yet do not always follow-through to actually play. GAP has evolved through a series of stages assessing applicability as a stand alone, heuristic based approach versus one-on-one usability testing. Outcomes suggest potential for GAP as (1) effective Heuristic Evaluation, (2) adjunct to Usability Testing, and (3) as proactive filters in beginning conceptual and first learning level tutorial design to increase Game Approachability--for all levels of gamers.},

However, existing multi-device design approaches are not suitable for domain experts, whose input can be invaluable to come to a suitable user interface for a specific domain. Existing techniques often require the manipulation of high-level models and transformations which are difficult to interpret and predict by a domain expert without a technical background. We present Meta-GUI-Builders, a new generation of graphical user interface builder tools that allows domain experts to create multi-device GUI designs themselves. These tools automatically adapt their workspace to a specific domain by encapsulating domain-specific elements in the designer's tool palette. Engaging domain experts in a multi-device design approach is a first step towards creating aesthetic user interfaces that can be deployed on many devices, a combination that is hard to achieve with previous approaches.},

It compares performance when the pack is held in the hand, mounted on the back of the hand and finally on the wrist. The results show a significant, but numerically small, advantage in using the hands over using the upper arm only. This suggests that for wearable tasks where pointing is relatively infrequent a wrist based sensor pack may well be sufficient to enable effective and usable interaction.},

abstract = {To date, localized user interfaces are still being adapted to one nation, not taking into account cultural ambiguities of people within this nation. We have developed an approach to cultural user modeling, which allows to personalize user interfaces to an individual's cultural background. The study presented in this paper shows how we use this approach to predict user interface preferences. Results show that we are able to reduce the absolute error on this prediction to 1.079 on a rating scale of 5. These findings suggest that it is possible to automate the process of localization and, thus, to automatically personalizing user interfaces for users of different cultural backgrounds.},

In this paper we report on our findings from the development and testing of a fully functional MCE photo-conferencing service that enables seamless synchronous collaboration between remote mobile users over existing 3G cellular networks. Key to the development of MCEs is an understanding of the effects of remote gestural interactions between mobile participants. We report on the results of an initial evaluation of our photo-conferencing service, examining the effects of two remote gestural interactions, 'Pointing' and 'Scaling', assessing their impact on performance measurements. Our findings begin to inform the design of future mobile collaborative environments.},

Specifically, we present three different experiences to an audience-a traditional movie, its Self-DIM (SDIM) version with the audience's participation, and its Self-Friend-DIM (SFDIM) version with co-participation of the audience and his friends. The evaluation results show that the DIM movies (SDIM and SFDIM) elicit greater subjective sense of presence, engagement, and emotional reaction, and stronger physiological response (galvanic skin response, GSR) as compared with the traditional movie form; moreover, audiences show a phasic GSR increase responding to the appearance of their own or friends' CG characters on the movie screen.},

Taken together, Westin's and Altman's theories of privacy accounted for both younger and older adults' ideas about privacy; however, neither theory successfully accounted for findings across all age and gender groups. Whereas males tended to think of privacy in terms of personal needs and convenience, females focused more on privacy in terms of others, respecting privacy rights, and safety. Older adults tended to be more concerned with privacy of space than information privacy. Initial results suggest that designing for commonalities in privacy perceptions among group members is feasible.},

Computers typically cannot interpret imagery as effectively as humans can, and manual analysis tools are slow. The research reported here explores the feasibility of speeding up manual image analysis by tapping into split second perceptual judgments using electroencephalograph sensors. Experimental results show that a combination of neurophysiological signals and overt physical responses--detected while a user views imagery in high speed bursts of approximately 10 images per second--provide a basis for detecting targets within large image sets. Results show an approximately six-fold, statistically significant, reduction in the time required to detect targets at high accuracy levels compared to conventional broad-area image analysis.},

We propose that a tool that keeps track of the users' objects and seamlessly inter-relates information about them with other relevant autobiographical and contextual data, about the users and their activities, can help manage and retrieve both physical and electronic items in meaningful ways. We describe a prototype tool, RealFind that allows this to take place in a synergistic and effective way. Objects can be searched for based on their properties, but also by relating them to a wide range of contextual information stored on their computers.},

It demonstrates that the Wikipedia community has shifted in the last two years to prioritizing policymaking and organization experience over simple article-level coordination, and mere edit count does not lead to adminship. The model can be applied as an "AdminFinderBot" to automatically search all editors' histories and pick out likely future admins, as a self-evaluation tool, or as a dashboard of relevant statistics for voters evaluating admin candidates.},

I believe that creating an interest in technology and science for women from a young age could help increase the number of females in technology-based fields. When a mother and daughter make electronic crafts together, the mother becomes a good role model for technology use, and can help stimulate her child's interests in science and technology.

In one pilot study reported here, outcomes such as purchase intention and attitudes toward products on an e-commerce site are dictated by user perceptions of others' opinions about the site's products. Empirical determination of the cues triggered by collaborative filtering technologies and the psychological mechanisms by which they lead to bandwagon effects have important implications for interface design of technologies that display user input.},

We show that using common machine learning techniques our device can reliably distinguish five separate classes based on the users' grasps. While this interaction is currently implemented in a multi-function handheld, we anticipate the existence of many scenarios where grasp recognition could provide a more intuitive or useful interface.},

abstract = {The area of multimodal interaction has expanded rapidly. However, the implementation of multimodal systems still remains a difficult task. Addressing this problem, we describe the OpenInterface (OI) framework, a component-based tool for rapidly developing multimodal input interfaces. The OI underlying conceptual component model includes both generic and tailored components. In addition, to enable the rapid exploration of the multimodal design space for a given system, we need to capitalize on past experiences and include a large set of multimodal interaction techniques, their specifications and documentations. In this work-in-progress report, we present the current state of the OI framework and the two exploratory test-beds developed using the OpenInterface Interaction Development Environment.},

In this paper, we investigate whether this Midas Touch effect would also occur under mediated conditions (i.e., a text messaging system and an arm strap equipped with vibrotactile actuators). Although helping behavior was more frequently endorsed in the touch, compared to the no touch condition, this difference was not found to be statistically significant. Such a failure to find response similarities between vibrotactile stimulation and real (i.e., unmediated) physical contact undermines the design rationale of the field of mediated social touch, which aims to provide an alternative for real physical contact.},

Results showed that the more time-consuming active interaction was indeed more helpful to less-proficient students, but it was not as helpful to more-proficient students. Results also indicate that both more- and less-proficient students learn more from system initiated information presentation. These results will help to design a user-adaptive e-learning system that can determine which kind of interactivity and information presentation works best for which students and when.},

Initial analyses suggest that consultants interacted with the knowledge repository with very instrumental ends in mind, looking for information that resembled more tidbits than knowledge. Time was also an important constraint--search was rarely approached without a perceived time cost. Though deeper analysis is pending, our data points to broader implications for the design of knowledge repositories, designers' and scholars' conceptualizations of them, and subsequently, approaches to studying them. We end with a discussion of next steps toward developing this work more fully.},

However, it becomes difficult to maintain natural turn-taking in video conferencing with transmission delays because the utterances and movements of each participant are presented to the others with a time lag, which often leads to a collision of utterances. In order to facilitate smooth communication over a video-conferencing system, we propose a novel method, "Visual Filler," that fills temporal gaps in turn-taking caused by the existence of delays. Visual Filler overlays an artificial visual stimulus that has a function similar to that of filler sounds on a screen with participant images. We have evaluated the effectiveness of a Visual Filler for reducing the unnaturalness of turn-taking on a simulated dyadic dialog situation with a delay.},

These technologies try to get people to form relationships with them rather than simply interact with them. They may do this through having behaviours that encourage people to attribute personality or emotion to them. They may be persuasive technologies in the sense of Fogg that aim to get people to do things they would rather not do. They may promote trust. The convergence of a number of technologies is making personification technologies possible. Speech as an interaction is finally becoming robust and useable and is very influential in people attributing intelligence to devices and systems. Human language technologies allow devices to understand, or appear to understand, conversation. Interactions are becoming more natural and engaging. Avatars appear more congenial and coordinated.Building on the experience of a previous project, and drawing on the experience of a four year multi-disciplinary project, called Companions, the authors are keen to build community relationships around the notion of personification technologies. This includes the design, engineering, research (including ethics and social issues) and usability communities.},

Our motivation for the visualization is, of course, the well known red-blue map that depicts election results according to support for a particular political party. Further, we intend to look at the competitiveness of the districts where congressional elected officials reside, the noticeable features on their websites (for example, if a blog or visible contact information exists), as well as the results in relation to demographic information about the individual (political party, gender, age, etc). Beyond developing an understanding of the political landscape, our study aims to suggest a set of heuristics that tend to lead to more favorably perceived website designs.},

By processing the images from the camera, the system calculates the positioning information of the each node and performs the timing control of the LED in the each node in real time. Therefore, the author is able to design a uniquely arranged pattern in full-color in the real world, by distributing and controlling the smart nodes.

The concept of this method is adapted by inspecting and carefully considering the nature of Myanmar language word formations or hand writing orders. According to the initial user study with our software keyboard prototype, users were able to type at ~41.57 characters per minute with mouse, ~41.84 characters per minute with stylus pen, ~14.76 characters per minute with Logitech dual thumbstick game pad and ~20.52 characters per minute with Nintendo Wii remote controller. These numbers are sure to improve as further refinements on program interface are made. The merits of the proposed predictive text input method is that even first time users can type Myanmar sentences with appropriate typing speed, and that this approach is applicable for various kinds of mobile devices (see Figure.1) and extendable for other similar syllabic languages such as Khmer (language of Cambodia), Nepali (language of Nepal), Thai (language of Thailand) and Hindi (one of the languages of India) etc.},

abstract = {In this paper we present \~{N}uu Xaa, a tin collecting bank to support homeless people's self-subsistence in the city of Huajuapan de Le\'{o}n. The main goal of this system is to improve homeless people's quality of life by providing them with the opportunity to have remunerative self-employment. We think that the implementation of \~{N}uu Xaa will bring homeless people social, economical and psychological benefits because they will be able to earn enough money in order to satisfy their elementary needs and the community will understand that homeless people aren't lazy but just people in need.},

We propose combining the affordability, simplicity and portability of cell phones with the fast emerging QR Code technology to develop an information system which could augment current data entry methods utilized by homeless service agencies. The system offers simple interfaces which employ QR Codes for configuring cell phones to perform basic functions such as setting up reminders. The system is robust to the loss of its components, individual phones and QR cards. We developed and refined our design concept through an iterative design process of contextual inquiry, persona development, prototyping, and user tests.},

As part of the user interface software community's effort to address these challenges, the concept of a User Interface Description Language (UIDL), reemerge as a promising approach.To date, the UIDL research area has demonstrated extensive development, mainly targeting multi-platform and multi-modal user interfaces. However, many open questions remain regarding the usefulness and effectiveness of UIDLs in supporting the development of next generation interfaces.The aim of this workshop is to bring together both developers of next generation user interfaces and UIDL researchers in an effort to identify key challenges facing this community, to jointly develop new approaches aimed at solving these challenges and finally to consider future spaces for UIDL research.},

abstract = {As the selection of products and services becomes profuse in the technology market, it is often the delighting user experience (UX) that differentiates a successful product from the competitors. Product development is no longer about implementing features and testing their usability, but understanding users' daily lives and evaluating if a product resonates with the in-depth user needs. Although UX is a widely adopted term in industry, the tools for evaluating UX in product development are still inadequate. Based on industrial case studies and the latest research on UX evaluation, this workshop forms a model for aligning the used UX evaluation methods to product development processes. The results can be used to advance the state of "putting UX evaluation into practice".},

abstract = {Mental illness has been identified as one of the greatest challenges facing society in the coming decades. However, there are significant barriers to access for many people suffering from mental illness, including overburdened public health care systems, geographic distance from point of care, difficulties encountered by individuals in engaging with services, and the stigma associated with mental illness. Technology has the potential to significantly improve access, engagement, effectiveness and affordability of treatment, yet relatively little use has been made of technology to date. Significant opportunities exist for further research and development, but the domain throws up a variety of challenges for HCI design and HCI methods.},

abstract = {Sonic Interaction Design (SID) is an emerging field that is positioned at the intersection of auditory display, ubiquitous computing, interaction design, and interactive arts. SID can be used to describe practice and inquiry into any of various roles that sound may play in the interaction loop between users and artifacts, services, or environments, in applications that range from the critical functionality of an alarm, to the artistic significance of a musical creation. This field is devoted to the privileged role the auditory channel can assume in exploiting the convergence of computing, communication, and interactive technologies. An over-emphasis on visual displays has constrained the development of interactive systems that are capable of making more appropriate use of the auditory modality. Today the ubiquity of computing and communication resources allows us to think about sounds in a proactive way. This workshop puts a spotlight on such issues in the context of the emerging domain of SID.},

It will seek to draw upon existing research into place, presence and situated interaction while exploring areas of art, flow, ambience, urban design, performance and technology. In doing so, it will bridge the divide between art and science which exists in the growing research area of urban mixed realities. The anticipated outcome is a closer examination of the issues relevant to interacting within urban mixed realities and how to drive the research agenda forward.},

abstract = {This workshop addresses a new online phenomenon: social data analysis, that is, collective analysis of data supported by social interaction. The recent democratization of data sources on the Internet--from mandated publication of government-generated data to scientific repositories of experimental data sets--has enabled a new kind of web site where users upload and collaboratively analyze the most varied sorts of data. So far, most of these sites have relied on visualization as an intrinsic part of their analytical arsenal. The goals of this workshop are to: Bring together, for the first time, the social data analysis communityExamine the design of social data analysis sites todayDiscuss the role that visualizations play in social data analysisExplore how users are utilizing the various sites that allow them to exchange data-based insights.},

abstract = {Many of us work and socialize late into the night, some increasingly so. However, most information technology is still designed in the daytime and largely to be used in the light. Little thought is given to its behavior in darkness, even if the technology itself can sense darkness, or sleep. The aim of the workshop outlined below is to examine night and darkness as a starting point for designing ubiquitous computing. We aim to explore if and how the behavior of our technology should change as night falls. The workshop will use the topics of darkness, safety, 'nighttime people' and nighttime activities to think about new design opportunities for interaction design and ubiquitous computing. Practicing what we preach, so to speak, the workshop participants will also critique their ideas and designs in the dark, in Florence.},

abstract = {The keeping of secrets and practicing of deception are commonplace in everyday social interaction. They also serve an important role in encouraging social cohesion.

This workshop will bring together researchers of both deception and secrecy in computer-mediated interaction, alongside designers of systems, to face up to these challenges and develop a road map for the future. The workshop will act as a venue for the synthesis of theory with design, and propose ways to face the challenges of enabling authentic social interaction in computerized environments.},
