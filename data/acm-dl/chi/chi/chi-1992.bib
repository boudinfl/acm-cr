abstract = {Previous studies of library on-line catalogs [5], have identified subject searching as both the most popular method of access as well as the most problematic. These findings have stimulated a large amount of research on subject or topical access, most focusing on the <u>vocabulary</u> of the subject headings list and ways to improve its richness (e.g. [4]) There have been fewer explorations of the problems inherent in the <u>structure</u> of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and how this structure combined with user's knowledge structure contributes to the subject searching problem. Because knowledge structure has been shown to differentiate between novices and experts [2], and because expertise affects success in searching online catalogs [1], knowledge structure may play a role in subject searching. Results from a previous field study have confirmed these expectations. Therefore, to further test this hypothesis, this study examines how the knowledge structures of experts and novices in a given field differ from the structures of librarians and the LCSH for that field.},

The goals for this project were to develop a simple retrieval system that would contain much of the functionality of existing retrieval systems, while minimizing the problems of access. Thus, it serves as a system that can be easily accessed and used with minimal effort or instruction. This poster provides a brief description of the motivation for, and implementation of IRMail, and then describes how HCI researchers may perform searches on the HCIBIB archives with IRMail.},

an interface for video manipulation be made sufficiently simple and
powerful to free the user's attention to focus on creative aspects
of the medium? How are images to be described so that they can be
retrieved? How is this representation to be presented to the user?
Issues of knowledge representation and interface design are tightly
linked.The Electronic Scrapbook is an environment designed to encourage
people to use home video as a creative medium. This work addresses
issues of knowledge representation, narrative structure, and
interface design. To date, I have:•Developed the metaphor of a scrapbook as an interface
for a video manipulation environment.•Applied a semantic network to video logging.•Implemented a pane-based video logging interface,
which keeps information organized and minimizes screen clutter (see
Figure 1).•Used inheritance to save the user work in logging
video.•Created a library of story models, which help the user
to tell home-video stories.•Applied the use of specific domain knowledge to help
the user.•Focused on viewing the computer and the user as
partners in a creative process.•Implemented a working system.Issues still to be solved include:•Designing an interface to allow the user to create new
story models.•Extending the logging interface to allow the user to
modify the underlying ontology.•Creating ontologies for additional subject
domains.•Integrating object and stream representations of video
to maintain simplicity while better accounting for video's temporal
nature.•Testing the design on real users.Computer technology promises to make video more accessible to
the non-specialist. However, careful interface design is needed to
hide technical complexities and free the user's attention to learn
about narrative structures and the creative potential of the
medium. Using detailed color screen shots of the interface, I will
be able to discuss the solutions I have obtained so far and the
challenges that remain for incorporating video in the
interface.},

abstract = {Have you ever had difficulty adjusting your refrigerator temperature, setting your VCR program, or transferring a call to another extension? The source of these difficulties is often a failed mapping between the designers' and the users' models of a system (Norman, 1988); in brief, user's have flawed mental models (or devices have flawed designs). This study examined how providing explicit models to users or allowing them to explore the system's functioning could serve as a bridge between designer and user device images. Using a simple device, the temperature controls in a refrigerator, we compared performance on temperature adjustment using an explicit model, an implicit model, and a no model condition. Exploration was introduced as an alternative to explicit presentation of a model; subjects could try out the simulated device before beginning a specific task. Although this type of exploration has gained increased popularity as a training strategy, there appear to be substantial individual differences in the utility of that approach. Some people enjoy the assimilation of information and focus on the question rather than on any specific resolution ("perceivers"), and these people are likely to enjoy exploration. Other people, in contrast, are focussed on answers and prefer closure ("judgers"); an exploratory environment is likely to be less useful for that group. We analyzed whether these general differences in cognitive style would influence the utility of exploration as a learning tool in our task.},

abstract = {This poster describes our involvement in the design of the user interface for a hi-fi audio set. The "life cycle" of a consumer-electronics product can, for the owner, roughly be divided into four phases: (1) first impression, (2) initial use, (3) long-term use and (4) replacement. During each of these phases different aspects of the user interface of the product are important. The first two phases, first impression and initial use, normally take place in the store where the product has to compete with other brands and models. The first-impression phase starts when potential buyers are shopping around and a product catches their eyes. During this phase it is important how the product promotes itself among competing products (self-promotion) and what kind of expectations the product elicits, i.e. the perceived potential. After some time the potential buyer selects the product for a closer inspection, and will typically start to perform some baseline tasks, starting the initial-use phase. Then it is important how the product's features are recognized (self-explanation). After the purchase decision has been made, the product enters the home where it has to comfort the owner. That is when the transition from initial to long-term use takes place. During long-term use, classical usability issues are dominant. The expectations that the user has acquired of the product are checked. Eventually the product will be replaced or become obsolete.},

abstract = {The current research is a complex, 5 day, training experiment
investigating several questions about the learning and use of
software methods. Central issues concern the situation in which a
software user knows more than one obvious method for accomplishing
a task at hand. We call this situation "multiple methods". Multiple
methods seem to arise most often from the creation of commands or
functions specialized for a subclass of tasks. For example, in a
word processing application there are often several ways to move
the cursor, with arrow keys, by word, by line, by page, to end of
line, to start of line, to top of document, and to bottom, to name
some common methods. Designers and users typically assume that the
existence and use of multiple methods in an application increases
user efficiency. We tested that assumption directly. In this
experiment we investigated the effects of multiple methods during
learning and performance measuring task time, planning time, and
error rates and types. In addition, we also investigated strategies
subjects employed when choosing between their methods.In a rigorous training regime using the spreadsheet software
Lotus 123, subjects learned one or two ways to move the cursor and
one or two ways to sum the contents in a section of cells. During
the 5 day experiment, subjects repeatedly moved the cursor to an
indicated location and entered a formula summing an adjacent group
of numbers. Cursor movements were of varying distances and sums
involved various numbers of addends.On the first day, subjects were taught their method set which
they practiced to a criterion of 24 consecutive correct
repetitions. On days 2 and 3 (practice), subjects performed tasks
comprised of 128 repetitions of their method set. On every task,
the best method was assigned in the instructions and used by the
subjects. The best method was determined by constructing
theoretical keystroke models of the methods (see Olson &amp;
Nilsen, 1988) and assigning the most rapid method. During practice,
the order in which the methods were used was counter-balanced.On days 4 and 5 (testing), subjects performed 338 similar tasks
but selected the method themselves on every task. These 338 tasks
were comprised of thirteen different cursor task distances and
thirteen sizes of sums sampled thirteen times each. During both
practice and testing, subjects used the &lt;enter&gt; key
to toggle between task instructions and the spreadsheet on which
the tasks were performed. During a cursor task, the target cell was
not indicated until the subject removed the instruction screen
stating: "move the cursor to the target cell using the X method".
Similarly, during a summation task, the addends were apparent only
after the instruction screen was removed. This allowed partitioning
of the total task time into planning time and typing times.During both practice and testing, and on both cursor and
summation tasks, subjects who knew two methods for a task made more
errors on that task type (matched tasks) only. That is, knowing two
sum methods increased the number of sum task errors, but did not
increase the number of cursor task errors. Similarly, knowing two
cursor movement methods increased the number of cursor task errors,
but not summation task errors. In addition, two method subjects
were no faster on matched tasks than were one method subjects,
despite their specialized methods. In fact, the two method subjects
had <u>longer</u> planning times on matched tasks than
did one method subjects. Once again, these effects of knowing two
methods were segregated to matched tasks.It is interesting to compare the two groups of subjects that
each knew three methods as a way of controlling for effects of
workload imposed purely by the number of methods known. The
subjects with two cursor methods and one sum method (2-1 subjects)
were compared to those with one cursor method and two sum methods
(1-2 subjects). Consonant with the results above, 2-1 subjects made
more cursor task errors than did the 1-2 subjects who made more sum
task errors. Increases in planning time at the start of the task
followed this same pattern.Although error rates were low and task time differences modest
---between 500 to 3000 msec---in a population of "real users" who
know more commands and do not undergo such rigorous practice the
differences are expected to be much larger. These results
contradict the common assumption that specialized methods for
subclasses of tasks increase a user's efficiency. In addition,
these results demonstrate the costs of multiple methods even in an
impoverished repertoire of only four commands.},

abstract = {This experiment examined the influence of the style of the
computer user interface on the extent to which performance was
decreased by task interruption. Performance on data entry of a
personnel database was compared using two different styles of
interfaces, under three different forms of interruption. Ten
subjects were given a graphical user interface with a mouse and
screen buttons; and ten were given a character-based interface with
tab and function keys. Interruptions came at unexpected times. Each
subject was interrupted three times, once with each form of
interruption: telephone call, visitor, and on-screen message.
During each interruption, the subject was asked to answer a simple
question. The number of fields entered minus the number of fields
in error, per minute, was measured during the two-minute
post-interruption period. Eye motion data was analyzed in terms of
the amount of time and the average durations of eye fixations on
the screen. An exit questionnaire solicited the subjects'
perceptions of their performance.Compared to the control, the screen interruption was disruptive,
the telephone interruption was not, and the walk-in visitor
interruption produced intermediate performance. Performance was
worse in the first minute than in the second minute immediately
following the interruptions. Lower performance was directly related
to looking more at the screen. The duration of the interruption was
weakly correlated to the performance. Subjects' perceptions of
their performance did not correlate with performance measures.The disruptive effect of the screen interruption compared to the
lack of disruption after the telephone interruption was a surprise.
This result is contrary to the commonly held belief that telephone
interruptions are a problem to computer users. It may be important
to avoid disruption caused by screen windows popping up in design
of multi-window user interfaces. Trends in office automation have
the screen being used for more and more functions, with demands on
screen displays being further aggravated by information available
through integrated networks.The disruption of the screen interruption may be due to the
abruptness of the on-set of the interruption which prohibited the
subject from completing the current action. The message box locked
out the main task until the subject responded to the question. This
differed from the onset of the walk-in and telephone interruptions
which did not lock out interaction with the main task. Another
possible explanation for the disruption of the screen interruption
compared to the telephone interruption may be the similarity in
sense modality. This work is seen as preliminary to further
study.},

abstract = {To investigate if a life-cycle model exists for Human-Computer
Interface (HCI) principles and integrate this into courseware
design for Computer-Based Training (CBT). To develop a suitable
model for the design of the user interface looking at ways of
evaluating usability of HCI's for CBT courseware. A model centred
upon the use of high quality and creative instructional design
embracing the changing technologies coupled with clear principles
of learning and cognitive psychology which enables usability
evaluation is therefore desirable. The Multimedia Interactive
Design Aided System (MIDAS) model presented in this paper is a
formulation based upon such criteria. The implementation of the
model presented is centred on the following application - The
training of pilots and engineers on the braking system of the
British Aerospace Jetstream Aircraft.The multimedia authoring tool used for the implementation is
Authorware Professional, and the courseware application is
presented on a Macintosh environment, which can be converted to a
Windows environment. Macromind Director has been used to create the
animation, sound, and graphic windows and imported into
Authorware.<i>The need for a practical method for accessing usability
of CBT courseware.</i>The ultimate aim in producing guidance for well-designed user
interfaces must be to improve usability of the system for the user.
However, guidelines rarely concern the <i>needs</i> and
<i>requirements</i> imposed on the interface by the
tasks which an end-user carries out in a particular context. In
addition, the presentation of guidelines generally includes very
little guidance concerning where, when and how to use them, and how
to apply them in a particular situation. In CBT courseware
evaluation, guidelines therefore have a limited use as a means of
evaluating the effectiveness of a user interface when carrying out
tasks. In order to enable the research findings emerging in this
area to be applied in assessing usability, a method is needed which
goes beyond lists of design guidelines, but which utilizes relevant
material existing within them.The principles presented outline how my research contributes and
provides a better understanding to the development of a new
approach to the evaluation of CBT courseware.The method, and the nature of the checklist, enables an
interface to be evaluated by a variety of people, with differing
expertise and backgrounds, including, for example, CBT trainers,
developers, interface designers and other experts, and most
importantly, representative end-users, who may, or will, actually
use the system in practice.<i>The method does not aim to solve problems, or to enable
a quantitative assessment of usability. It provides a means of
identifying problem areas, of extracting information on problems,
difficulties, weaknesses, areas for improvement, etc.</i>The evaluation criterion headings are:Visual Clarity•Consistency•Compatibility•Informative feedback•Explicitness•Appropriate functionality•Flexibility and control•Error prevention and correction•User guidance and support•System usabilityThe results and conclusions drawn from the experimentation
carried out during the past year will be summarised in graphical
form.The potential financial benefits of using the method will be
summarised.Finally a set of Practical guidelines for the production of a
user-interface for CBT courseware will be presented, based on the
MIDAS model, which will take into account changes to the initial
design model which have come to light as a result of the evaluation
process.},

abstract = {Tutorial is an interactive exploratory learning tool designed to
aid programmers in learning graphics programming and Silicon
Graphics Inc.'s Graphics Library (GL) in particular.Tutorial is driven by four demo programs that present
<i>simulated source code</i> to the student. The
student uses Tutorial by executing each line of code and noticing
its effects on the graphics state, representations of the internal
hardware, and the final output. We intend that the exploratory
nature of the system will result in deep learning of graphics
programming concepts.The user interacts with Tutorial by modifying parameters to GL
function calls, choosing lines of source code to execute, and
modifying the graphics state directly. Nearly all aspects of the
graphics state are both inspectable and modifiable, with these
changes propagated throughout the entire system.This interaction aids in: determining what are reasonable
parameters for GL functions; observing how GL functions
interrelate; observing how the functions modify the graphics state;
and observing how the graphics state determines what is presented
in the final window.The poster describes Tutorial and presents four scenarios of
Tutorial in use. Each scenario is a series of pictures which show
the modification of function parameters and the effect of the
modification on the final image. The scenarios we will show are:
the use of the perspective and lookat to define the viewpoint and
viewing volume; orthographic projection and how it relates to the
viewport and the hardware zbuffer; how the 2-dimensional
orthographic projection, viewport and charstr interact; and using
the overlay and underlay framebuffers.Each scenario demonstrates how Tutorial enables the user to come
to a deeper understanding of the effects of various graphics
library functions. For instance, the relationship between the
orthographic projection area and the viewport (screen) area is
explained. The scenarios also demonstrates the different ways the
user can interact with Tutorial. These include modifying function
parameters, altering the simulated source code, changing the
<i>state</i> of the system directly (bypassing the
simulated source code), and inspecting various parts of the
graphics pipeline. As well the features of the interface and the
control of the simulated source code will become apparent from the
scenarios.},

As such the CW needs to be easy to understand and apply. It was originally developed to evaluate the usability of 'walk-up-and-use' interfaces, such as ATM's (Lewis, Polson, Wharton, and Rieman, 1990, and Polson, Lewis, Rieman, and Wharton, in press). The CW was used to evaluate the user interface of an existing support system for sales representatives (REPS), which is a fairly complex system that provides access to various databases and a limited editing capability. Its interface consists of a multitude of different screens, each only used for a few basic functions. Therefore this evaluation of REPS with the help of the Cognitive Walkthrough was seen as a reasonable test of the breadth of the Cognitive Walkthrough's applicability. The poster describes the effectiveness of the method and the effort needed to use it.},

abstract = {Out work focuses on improving the interaction between people at a distance by providing them with shared electronic props. The Conversation Board is a prototype multi-person drawing tool intended as a medium for the introduction and manipulation of props during conversation. Props such as sketches, digitized photographs, editable text, and sound clips can be placed onto the shared canvas, moved around, modified, and annotated with colored marker tools. We envision it being used in situations such as informal office meetings, distance education and training, and medical consulting.Our design was motivated by conducting an informal study of how people used their office whiteboards for communication. We asked people to explain the contents of their whiteboards and the conversations that led to them. We found that their drawings often represented objects, such as text and block diagrams, which have specific semantic properties that we attempt to support in our electronic tool.The Conversation Board was built in the RENDEZVOUS™ system, an experimental toolkit designed at Bellcore to support multi-user applications. This poster also briefly describes the capabilities of our toolkit and the applications we've built with it.},

abstract = {In the Fall of 1991 the University of Arizona installed GroupSystems, a group decision support system (GDSS), in a new facility in Sofia, Bulgaria. Fall 1991 marked two years since Bulgaria separated from the (then) USSR and was synchronous with the installation of a democratic government. The GDSS facility in Sophia is located at the University of National and World Economics. The facility contains eight user stations, a facilitator station, and a network server. A large monitor is available at the front of the room to allow individual screens to be publicly projected. The facility's GroupSystems software features modules for: brainstorming, stakeholder identification, voting. questionnaire design and administration, group editing. and topic discussion. The software can be run using either the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets. Anonymity is available in all modules and subgroups of participants can be created. Initial group experiences in the facility indicate that Bulgarians are receptive to GDSS technology, particularly modules allowing anonymous discussion. The current research proposes to compare the implementation of a GDSS technology for Bulgarian business people government officials with the implementation of the same technology for American foreign service officers serving in Bulgaria.},

abstract = {We report on a two-part longitudinal study of computer-supported
cooperative work. It focuses on the impact of coordinating and
enabling technologies through an examination of computer-supported
information exchange patterns. Colleagues were required to work
together to complete a project within a specified time frame. The
patterns of information exchange observed in this environment
provide evidence as to which aspects of groupware are perceived as
helpful by users, and provide an impetus for further research.The objectives of this research are to: 1) examine patterns of
information exchange in order to provide descriptive data on the
process of using groupware; and 2) identify factors that need to be
considered for effective and efficient use of groupware in a CSCW
environment. The two studies allow for an investigation of the
difference between 1) small novice-user groups formed across class
sections (locations) with each group responsible for developing a
complete proposal and 2) a large experienced-user group formally
divided into subgroups, with each subgroup responsible for
developing a portion of a proposal.In the first study, participants were graduate students in an
advanced information systems course. The research task was to
develop a proposal for a company with inventory data control and
other related problems (inefficient production layouts and machine
utilization) in a simulated business information systems consulting
environment. There were six teams with four or five participants on
each team. Each team was split across two sections of the course.
Differential information was provided to each section and team
members were encouraged to use the groupware for communications
concerning the project. The participants were novice users of the
software.In the second study, participants were graduate students in a
data communications and networking course. All nine had taken the
previous course and were experienced with the groupware. The
research task was a team network analysis and design project.
Participants were encouraged to use the groupware for
communications as in Study 1. They were divided into three teams of
three, with one team responsible for the LAN portion of the
proposal, the second team responsible for the WAN portion, and the
third team responsible for the integration of the LAN and WAN
material, and for the development of the proposal package. A
graduate student who had previously taken the course acted as
project manager.After participants had completed the two projects, the messages
were categorized using a previously developed coding scheme. The
message frequency and type yielded descriptive information
regarding the impact of the technology on interactions among
participants, and the relationship between decision outcomes and
patterns of information exchange.The findings include: 1) the groupware used needs to be matched
to the task, group structure, and environment; 2) minimal social
use of the system occurred over time; 3) the message mix tended to
shift from scheduling and coordinating efforts to task-related
efforts as deadlines loomed; and 4) the system provided descriptive
information on team work habits. These patterns and other
qualitative data gathered from participants provide insight into
the use of the groupware, group behavior, and the importance of
group structure, task, and environment.},

They use CSILE's tools to construct linked textual and graphical database "notes" which are available to all members of the classroom community. They are browsed (via keywords, links, and other means of navigation), read, evaluated, built upon, and, commented on. A note's author is informed of all comments and all comments are available to all users of the database.

abstract = {Computer systems offering windowing environments have been readily embraced by the computer user community. These capabilities have become so popular in recent years, that even the more traditional command-line systems such as IBM PCs are offering windowing environments. The question arises as to whether or not a windowing environment is appropriate for any and all user environments. This question has particular importance for computer systems that control complex processes and hazardous environments, such as Nuclear Power Plants or Space Station Freedom. Both of these examples represent multitasking environments where there is a large cognitive load on the user. It has been argued that the task of window management poses additional processing loads on the user. In fact, during the early definition of the Space Station Freedom human-computer interface, NASA's astronaut office strongly opposed a windowing environment, partially for "safety" reasons. It was felt that the windowing capabilities were dangerous in an environment where critical information could be accidently hidden, "lost", etc. It was also felt that managing the display of information was an unnecessary additional task.},

Systems must be designed to enhance normal human performance; training programs must be designed to alleviate likely errors; and functions that are human-error prone should be automated. To successfully design and implement this program requires a theoretically motivated model of human problem solving and decision making based on current theories of human cognition. Further, such a model must be data-validated to ensure its ultimate applicability. Principles of cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, and Total Quality Management (TQM) are used to analyze past errors and make changes to end-user applications and training requirements to prevent these errors in the future.},

The human-computer interface with a mouse can give us both visual and kinesthetic information. However, the tactile information that occurs when we touch an object in a natural situation is not available from a mouse. In psychophysical studies, it has been shown that tactile information added to visual information helps to increase the velocity of finger movements and reduces the dependence on vision [1]. It is, therefore, expected that an interface device capable of presenting tactile information would improve the efficiency of operation and reduce the visual load. Thus, we have developed a human-computer interface device based on a mouse that gives tactile and force sensations to the operator in addition to visual information. This interface device can be defined as a multi-modal integrative mouse.},

abstract = {Many gesture interfaces such as "Put-That-There" require operators to wear special devices such as "Data-Glove" to make the system recognize hand gestures. However, wearing such devices prevents the realization of a natural interface. We have developed the "Finger-Pointer" experimental system, which can recognize pointing actions and simple hand forms in realtime by image processing. The operator is not required to physically contact any control devices. We present the details of the image processing techniques employed, and a principle for stable measurement of pointing direction. We also solved the time lag problem with multi-channel integration.},

abstract = {People use gestures to communitcate with other people without difficutlty. As a method of computer/human interaction, gestures are more intuitive and more direct than existing input devices, such as keyboards, mice, etc., and futhermore, are more functional. Using hand gestures, which are important human gestures, is a key technique to build a friendly user interface.Some gestures are considered to be simbols, such as "OK" gesture, American sign language. Others have numerical meaning, i.e. how long, how large, how fast. etc. To deal with both kinds of hand gestures, we propose a hand shape representation method.The method represents a hand shape with 15 dimensional data of 5 finger tip positions in 3D. To implement both static and dynamic hand gestures in a graphic object manipulation system, at each measurement time the current hand shape is classified into 10 classes of hand shapes using subspace method and the hand movement is evaluated using recurrnet neural network.The system allows a user to manipulate graphic objects intuitively and directly.},

abstract = {Pen-based interfaces that use markings to issue commands are
becoming more popular every day. The advantages of markings as
commands can also be used in traditional mouse-based interfaces. We
have developed a system called "HyperMark" which allows markings to
be used in Apple's HyperCard. For example, if HyperMarks are added
to a screen button, not only does a button react to a mouse press,
but marks can also be drawn on the button which trigger other
actions. This results in fewer buttons and faster interactions in
some cases. In effect, HyperMarks are similar to pop-menus where
additional functions are "hidden" under a button until popped up.
However, with HyperMarks, a user does not have to wait for menu
pop-up, visually search the menu and point to an item. Instead, a
mark triggers the item directly and quickly. Our intention is that
ordinary HyperCard users/programmers can incorporate markings into
their own HyperCard stacks.Two types of marking recognition systems can be used in
HyperMark. One system is a user trainable gesture recognizer
developed by Rubine (1991) which we have ported to HyperCard. In
Rubine's system a user can create their own vocabulary of markings
and train the recognizer with several examples of each marking. The
other recognition technique called "marking menus", developed by
Kurtenbach (1991), has a preset vocabulary of markings. This
vocabulary of marks consists of straight stroke marks distinguished
by the angle of the stroke. Although this marking set is very
limited, pie menus (Callahan, Hopkins, Weiser, &amp;
Shneiderman, 1988) are used in conjunction to help a user learn and
remember the associations between marks and commands.This poster presents the design issues concerning user
programming and use of either of these systems in the context of
HyperMark. Furthermore, we examine how these design issues apply to
marking based interfaces in general. The major issues are: how much
programming effort is required by a user to make use of one of
these systems? How easy to use is each system? How self explanatory
are they? How easily and successfully can marks be drawn in either
system?We have found that either system has its advantages and
disadvantages and that the systems can successfully be used
together. The advantage of the Rubine's system is that user can
create one's own custom set of markings. However the disadvantage
is that it is then the user's responsibility to design an
unambiguous mark set and provide examples to train the system.
Also, because markings are not self-revealing like buttons or
menus, some sort of user built explanation must also be created. In
contrast, with marking menus, because the marking set is preset, no
marking set need be designed and ambiguity is not a problem.
Furthermore, the pie menu aspect of marking menus provides built in
help. Adding a marking menu is as simple as adding a pop-up menu.
Thus for very little implementation overhead a user can obtain the
benefits of using marks.},

Initially, we displayed these images using a tiling window strategy as shown in Fig. 1(a). However, the screen space was too small to display both the workspace window and face windows at sizes large enough for effective use. To solve this problem, we devised the ClearFace technique that overlays the translucent face image onto the workspace image (Fig. 1(b))[2]. Although the quality of overlaid images is somewhat degraded, users can easily switch their attention between the workspace image and the face images. This human ability to selectively see one of two mixed images is accounted by the theory of "selective looking "[3]. However, we realized that there still remained some difficulties in separating the mixed images in ClearFace.},

abstract = {An image synthesizing method for the conference system with realistic sensations is discribed. In this conference system, a human image in virtual space has to be synthesized by tracing the motion of human in real space.But it is difficult to detect positions of all human joints from real image. We proposed a new image synthesizing method using an associative memory. This is memorized human representative motion patterns to conpensate insufficiency of detected information from real image.The human body region can easily be detected from each images of stereo by using deffrences between input image and background image, and also skin color regions can easily be detected by color information. 3D-positions of few points of human body(head, face, hands) are obtainable by stereo matching of a representative point in detected regions. By an associative memory memorized relation of standerd motion patterns with parameter that is independent from a human direction and an initial horizontal position, a motion is recognized from time-sequential 3D-positions of few points of human body. After motion recognition, a human direction is detected by matching the head movement of recognition result s and the movement of detected head position. At last 3D-positions of parts of representative motion in virtual space are adjusted to detected 3D-positions of parts by using Jacobian matrix.Simulation results are presented to show an effectiveness of this method.},

abstract = {The transformation of a sequence of moving images to a still image presents several problems: a loss of perceived image quality when looking at a single video frame; and a loss of context, since no individual frame captures everything conveyed in a sequence of images. We address these problems by developing a structured representation of moving image data. Using this representation we manipulate the video signal to build salient still frames, including some images with enhanced resolution. We discuss methods of automatically building a structured representation, methods for building salient stills and the potential applications of these images.},

abstract = {For economic reasons, the task performed by telephone operators is very time-sensitive, and the task has been studied extensively. Most of the work however has concerned the human-computer interaction between the operator and the workstation and not the human-human interaction between the operator and the customer. GOMS analyses of operators handling toll calls (1), found that conversation was on the "critical path" of the call most of the time. That is, during most of a call, verbally exchanged information was necessary for the next step. We are conducting exploratory analyses of operator-customer dialogs to learn how dialog variables might affect the speed or outcome of a call. In preliminary interviews with operators about their jobs, operators seldom mentioned the workstation, but rather talked about their job as dealing with customers in a time-sensitive way that balanced the demands of the job with the needs of the customer. The first study has focused on Directory Assistance calls, in which a customer asks for a telephone number (and/or possibly an address). The analysis focuses on what makes a long vs a short call and what makes a faster vs slower operator.},

Next, an experiment is described, in which an interactive system was presented to students with the help of a state transition diagram or a set of "production rules". The use of production rules was found to be an advantage in this experiment. The paper concludes with a discussion of mental models in the context of skill automatization and user interface transparency problems.},

abstract = {Media spaces such as CAVECAT[6] and RAVE[3] have been designed to facilitate collaborative work at a distance, but they have primarily focused on the use of computer managed audio and video as mechanisms to support meetings and video phone calls. Research has shown that frequent and spontaneous informal communication is crucial for project coordination and that the amount of communication that occurs varies directly with the proximity of co-workers[2, 4]. However, proximity is not always possible or desirable in today's work world. We suggest that a large amount of communication among co-workers is not from actual intentional communication contact but from opportunistic contact and environmental scanning in which each individual is picking up valuable coordination information. In an open office, proximal co-workers can overhear relevant conversations, view levels of partner progress, perceive changes in project direction, note co-worker's skill advantages and disadvantages, etc. on a real time basis. We propose that it is this aspect of the constant contact of an open office environment which provides the closeness and cohesion necessary for effective work coordination. The environment we want to create with the multi-media tools is not one of supporting meetings but one of supporting constant and continuous contact among co-workers. We want to simulate a shared office and have co-workers who may be miles apart or a simple corridor away working together in the environment to maintain a sense of group. We do not suggest that meeting support by media spaces is inappropriate, but rather, that it is insufficient for the type and amount of communication needed in complex detailed work assignments.},

abstract = {Traditional laboratory usability testing is frequently not performed due to a company's lack of funds, planning, or human factors expertise. Consequently, there is increasing interest in finding alternative usability testing methods that are easier and cheaper to implement than traditional laboratory usability testing. Recent studies are beginning to study and compare such techniques. These methods include Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen and Molich, 1990), and Cognitive Walkthrough (Polson, Lewis, Rieman, &amp; Wharton, 1990). For Heuristic Evaluation, Nielsen (1991) found that human-factors Experts were the best at finding an interface's usability problems, especially Experts who were also expert in the interface domain. Desurvire, Lawrence, &amp; Atwood (1991) found Experts' evaluations were the most reliable, and their best guess predictions were predictive of laboratory performance. Karat, Campbell, &amp; Fiegel (1992) similarly found that heuristic results were reliable and significantly predictive of laboratory data, yet empirical laboratory testing identified four and five times as many problems. Jeffries, Miller, Wharton, and Uyeda (1991) found that via Heuristic Evaluation, more severe problems were found than with laboratory testing or the Cognitive Walkthrough. This comparison study did, however, only utilize Experts in the heuristic condition, and System Designers in the Cognitive Walkthrough.},

Rosenbaum (1989) stated that usability evaluators require both an in-depth understanding of experimental design and methodology, and familiarity with an existing body of literature in human factors and usability. While many people, particularly in the social sciences, meet the first criteria, few have combined their experimental methodology training with human factors training. Psychologists and other social scientists without human factors training are, therefore, often hired to conduct usability tests. The accuracy of these observers, and the factors that affect observer performance in usability testing are unknown. A study was conducted to examine trainee observer performance in usability testing. Two factors that may affect observer performance, obviousness of usability problems and prior knowledge of problems, were examined.},
