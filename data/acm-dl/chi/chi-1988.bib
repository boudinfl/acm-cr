abstract = {I treat three related subjects: virtual-worlds research—the construction of real-time 3-D illusions by computer graphics; some observations about interfaces to virtual worlds; and the coming application of virtual-worlds techniques to the enhancement of scientific computing.We need to design generalized interfaces for visualizing, exploring, and steering scientific computations. Our interfaces must be direct-manipulation, not command-string; interactive, not batch; 3-D, not 2-D; multisensory, not just visual.We need generalized research results for 3-D interactive interfaces. More is known than gets reported, because of a reluctance to share “unproven” results. I propose a shells-of-certainty model for such knowledge.},

In the exploratory study reported here, a particular foot-operated device, the planar slide mole, was assessed against a mouse in a target-selection task. The study showed that novices can learn to select fairly small targets using a mole; for a target size of 1/8″ square, the response time equaled that of the mouse when keyboard homing time was taken into account.},

abstract = {Current acoustic speech recognition technology performs well with very small vocabularies in noise or with large vocabularies in very low noise. Accurate acoustic speech recognition in noise with vocabularies over 100 words has yet to be achieved. Humans frequently lipread the visible facial speech articulations to enhance speech recognition, especially when the acoustic signal is degraded by noise or hearing impairment. Automatic lipreading has been found to improve significantly acoustic speech recognition and could be advantageous in noisy environments such as offices, aircraft and factories.An improved version of a previously described automatic lipreading system has been developed which uses vector quantization, dynamic time warping, and a new heuristic distance measure. This paper presents visual speech recognition results from multiple speakers under optimal conditions. Results from combined acoustic and visual speech recognition are also presented which show significantly improved performance compared to the acoustic recognition system alone.},

The subjects in both experiments included highly experienced LISP programmers and occasional LISP users with moderate to little LISP experience. The dependent measure was the subjects' preference rating for each display technique. The results showed that occasional LISP users preferred range highlighting, an interlaced display of evaluation results, and a simultaneous display of called functions. However, expert LISP programmers had no differential preferences for highlighting techniques.},

abstract = {The introduction of automated information retrieval (IR) systems was met with great enthusiasm and predictions that manual literature searching soon would be replaced. Three decades later, IR systems have not progressed to the stage where any but the dedicated few can operate them without a highly skilled human intermediary acting as interface between user and system. In the interim, we have learned that the retrieval process is extremely complex both in terms of understanding people and their communication and in terms of understanding scientific information and technical vocabulary. Experiments with new techniques suggest to many the possibility of eliminating the human intermediary, either in large part or altogether; others would argue that the retrieval problems are too complex to be resolved for more than highly restricted domains. The possibility of eliminating the human intermediary is of current research interest to the several disciplines that are represented on this panel.The discussion will revolve around one central question: Is our inability to get end-users to search primarily a problem of understanding people and their communication, or is it primarily a problem of understanding scientific information and technical vocabulary? Among the constituent issues the panel will address are these:
Which are the most fundamental problems in constructing retrieval interfaces for the information seeker?How successful have been the attempts to build end-user oriented interfaces?Is a single, elegant solution to the problems of language handling, query negotiation, user modeling, and information retrieval possible?What techniques hold the most promise for automating the functions of the intermediary?What approaches are likely to be fruitless?Under what conditions is it possible and appropriate to automate some or all of the intermediary's skills and function?},

The trial attempted to both measure the effectiveness of The Coordinator as a communications tool and to evaluate the speech act communications paradigm on which it is based. Only the first of these two goals was realized. Changes in subjects' cognition were assessed using a series of semantic differential scales. One negative cognitive shift was supported by the data. However, the anecdotal evidence was far more negative, suggesting that the experimental methodology be enhanced to include measurement of affective dimensions of group dynamics. Implementation and support for cooperative work systems were found to be more difficult than anticipated. The test group was not convinced that The Coordinator offered functionality that was worth the effort involved in learning to use the product. An improved interface, more flexible terminology, and better implementation support is needed for successful installation of The Coordinator, or similar products.},

In this paper we explain the motivation for our work and provide practical examples of the use of fork and context. In addition, we outline algorithms for parsing and for generating parser tables.},

The approach adopted was based upon two principles: the replacement of visual interface entities by auditory analogues and appropriately constraining the resultant interface. Two forms of sound were used to embody the auditory interface: musical tones and synthetic speech. In order to test the principles a word processing program was implemented which demonstrated that a visual program might be adapted to be accessed through such an interface.},

Bitmapped computer displays, however, allow greater freedom in the placement, font, and general presentation of menus. A pie menu is a format where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distances from the center. Pie menus gain over traditional linear menus by reducing target seek time, lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor and increasing the target size in Fitts's Law, minimizing the drift distance after target selection, and are, in general, subjectively equivalent to the linear style.},

abstract = {We offer an account of how users choose between alternative methods which take different times to accomplish the same task. Users offered a choice between two methods do not necessarily pick the faster. We argue that users reduce the complexity of the decision space by applying a 'simple compensation schema' acquired from everyday experience. Linear models of performance time enable us to predict how users will view the situation in terms of this schema, and how accurate assessment of the optimal choices within the schema-based assimilations can result in an apparent bias in favour of one method.},

Our initial hypothesis was that behavioral evidence for such misconceptions comes about as a result of well-articulated hypothetical reasoning. Although the evidence we obtained supports this view, it also suggests that for the direct representation case some activity normally attributed to misconceptions is non-reasoned in nature and governed by inherent powers of the representation.},

abstract = {Approaches to integrating human factors or user interface knowledge and expertise with software development are still exploratory and evolving. The human-computer interface provides a broader range of user interface challenges than earlier technology, but human factors is only now starting to be widely recognized as a distinct discipline requiring integration with system development. Devoting human and computer resources to user interface enhancement has been considered a luxury, and in many places still is, but the falling cost of computational power and the growing user resistance to poor interfaces, as well as a rising need for product differentiation in the marketplace, insure that human factors will become a necessity where it has not already. The need to develop organizational approaches to support the integration of human factors or user interface expertise with product development is thus a relatively new concern. The integration problems that have been identified include some that are shared with more established support activities such as technical writing, and others that are particular to human factors or result from the relative unfamiliarity of the discipline.Approaches that have been taken to managing human factors resources in order to maximize influence on user interface development include: hiring human factors engineers or psychologists directly into development teams, concentrating human factors engineers in a support organization, making use of external consultants with user interface knowledge, placing a development group under the leadership of a human factors professional, and forming an educational center in which software engineers learn about human factors approaches. Below, each panelist focuses on the advantages of one particular approach.},

Partial, patterned and repetitive undoing and redoing actions are allowed on simple, complex and meta commands. The model subsumes the functionality of prior models.},

Several ways are examined of conditioning this distribution to enhance predictive power. A brief case study of actual use of a widely-used history system is also included.},

abstract = {Advisory systems can be very powerful general tools for users. Formal query languages, menus, and direct manipulation interfaces might not suffice to access advisory systems' full functionality. The capabilities of natural language interfaces could be required. Unfortunately, natural language interfaces are not meeting the needs yet. Wide syntactic coverage is often traded off against handling ungrammatical sentences. However, this study shows that users request help with a very simple and restricted English, characteristic of unplanned or of child language. Moreover, users' utterances are frequently ungrammatical. It is argued that the simple syntax and the ungrammaticalities are determined by features intrinsic to advisory systems: users request help by typing to perform another primary task under real-time production constraints. Because of intrinsic performance constraints, users naturally resort to earlier and simpler forms of syntax. Natural language interfaces to advisory systems need not cover a wide variety of syntactic constructions but they must emphasize robust parsing.},

On each trial the task time and measurement accuracy were recorded. Each experimental session was video recorded and verbal protocols were collected. These allowed decomposition of the subjects' behaviors into categories that would account for performance differences between the two scopes.

abstract = {Over forty years ago, Vannevar Bush articulated his vision of a “Memex” machine: “associative indexing, … whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another” [Bush 45]. In the sixties, Engelbart [Engelbart, English 68] built collaborative systems to provide idea structuring and sharing. Nelson [Nelson 81] coined “hypertext” and proposed world-wide networks for publishing, linking, annotating and indexing multiple versions of documents. With increasing numbers of research projects, papers, panels and conferences, and commercially available systems (e.g. Notecards by Xerox, Guide by Owl and HyperCard by Apple) in recent years, hypertext may be an idea whose time has finally come — or at least a phenomenon not to be ignored.The goal of this panel is not to define hypertext or hypermedia (at its simplest: non-linearly arranged and accessed information), debate its uniqueness, explain implementation issues, or survey the many applications and contributions in the field (see [Conklin 87] for an excellent survey of Hypertext, and the Proceedings of Hypertext '87 Workshop at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Rather, we intend to approach it from the perspective of the information user: reader, searcher, author. The panel will address the following issues:
Are the processes of authoring and understanding helped or hindered by the non-linear structure of hypertext, for which kinds of tasks and users? What is the difference between a hypertext writer and a knowledge engineer? In searching for information, what is the difference between browsing and querying?What experiments need to be done? What tools, environment or interfaces can improve the process of information creation and access? Can the overhead of creating or interpreting structure be reduced?When will hypertext replace paper, or should it? How do functions of author and reader co-evolve? Could this revolutionize society like the printing press? Why didn't the panelists create a multi-versioned, highly crossreferenced online entry for the proceedings? Is hypertext a technology in search of a problem?},

An architecture for the interface which facilitates the attainment of these four criteria is proposed. The architecture relies upon production system rules and various kinds of knowledge bases to tailor the user-computer dialogue to the ongoing context of the interaction. A prototype of this architecture has been implemented in LOOPS for interfacing to the UNIX system, and has been shown to enhance substantially the performance of novice users of the system.},

The segmenting data showed that programmers agree on the major components of a program and that these components are defined by goals in a plan representation. Pascal and FORTRAN programs that employ the same plan structure were segmented into similar components. Program sorting data also showed clustering into plan groups. However task related dimensions are also important parts of program representations.},

abstract = {The traditionally separate application areas supported by database systems and instructional systems are merging in the area of learning support environments (LSEs). We discuss the provision of tools in LSEs for navigating around large knowledge bases. The optimal form of navigation will depend on the nature of the user and of the learning requirements, and thus a variety of tools must be provided. We propose the use of a travel holiday metaphor as a means for structuring a set of navigation tools and illustrate its use in a system for teaching non-formal fields of knowledge.},

abstract = {The Palenque interactive multimedia digital video interactive prototype is based on themes, locations, and characters from The Second Voyage of the Mimi television show, which is being produced at Bank Street College. In the TV show, a cast of scientists and children explore the Yucatan's ancient Maya ruins and are introduced to the science of archeology. The Palenque prototype incorporates this theme to the extent that the user's experience is based on a virtual travel exploration of an ancient Maya site, Palenque, and on the perusal of a multimedia Palenque Museum database. One of our goals was to create a visually interesting database environment in which information in many formats could be browsed through spatially and thematically by children. In addition, we experimented with icon and window-based interface conventions that would make navigation around the video environment motivating and comprehensible for young users.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach for dealing with the vocabulary problem in human-computer interaction. Most approaches to retrieving textual materials depend on a lexical match between words in users' requests and those in or assigned to database objects. Because of the tremendous diversity in the words people use to describe the same object, lexical matching methods are necessarily incomplete and imprecise [5]. The latent semantic indexing approach tries to overcome these problems by automatically organizing text objects into a semantic structure more appropriate for matching user requests. This is done by taking advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with text objects. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by text-object matrix is decomposed into a set of about 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Terms and objects are represented by 50 to 150 dimensional vectors and matched against user queries in this “semantic” space. Initial tests find this completely automatic method widely applicable and a promising way to improve users' access to many kinds of textual materials, or to objects and services for which textual descriptions are available.},
