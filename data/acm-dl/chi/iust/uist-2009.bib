abstract = {Your conscious experience is not a function of the world, it is a function of the neural networks of your brain. Therefore, the biology of the brain and consciousness is as fundamental to understanding the universe, as we know it, as the high-energy physics of subatomic particles. This is especially true for the study of sensory and cognitive illusions, since they represent effects that clearly stand out as not representing the real world. That is, since illusions don't match reality we can know that by studying illusions we are studying exactly what the brain is actually doing, and not just what we think the brain should be doing. Your brain does a staggering amount of pragmatic self-dealing guesswork and outright confabulation in order to construct the highly imperfect mental simulation of reality known as "consciousness." This is not to say that objective reality isn't "out there" in a very real sense--but no one lives there. No one's ever even been there for a visit. Ironically, the fact that consciousness feels like a solid, robust, fact-rich transcript of reality is just one of the countless illusions your brain creates for itself.Illusions are not errors of the brain. Far from it. Illusions arise from processes that are critical to our survival. Our brains have developed illusory processes so that we may experience the world in a ready-to-consume manner. Remove the machinery of illusion, and you unwind the entire tapestry of human awareness. Illusions are those perceptual experiences that do not match the physical reality. They are therefore exquisite tools with which to analyze the neural correlates of human perception and consciousness. Neuroscientists have long known that they can only be sure of where they stand, in terms of correlating neural responses to awareness, when they correlate the awareness of an illusion to the brain's response, specifically because of the illusions' mismatch with reality. The study of illusions is therefore of critical importance to the understanding of the basic mechanisms of sensory perception and conscious awareness.If you've ever seen a good magician perform, you know how thrilling it is to watch the impossible happening before your eyes. The laws of physics, probability, psychology and common sense--the four trusty compass points in your mental map of reality--are suddenly turned into liabilities. Objects and people appear, vanish, levitate, transpose, transform, and with all your smarts you can't imagine how it's being done. Magicians are the premier artists of attention and awareness, and they manipulate our cognition like clay on a potter's wheel.And the mechanisms underlying magic perception have implications for our daily lives. The magical arts work because humans have hardwired processes of attention and awareness that are hackable. By understanding how magicians hack our brains, we can better understand how we work.},

Our visualization system is engineered to be overlaid on top of existing applications without requiring the applications to be modified in any way, and functions independently of the application's responses to user input. Ripples reduces the fundamental problem of ambiguity of feedback when an action results in an unexpected behaviour. This ambiguity can be caused by a wide variety of sources. We describe the ambiguity problem, and identify those sources. We then define a set of visual states and transitions needed to resolve this ambiguity, of use to anyone designing touch applications or systems. We then present the Ripples implementation of visualizations for those states, and the results of a user study demonstrating user preference for the system, and demonstrating its utility in reducing errors.},

In standard touchscreen systems a finger often appears to touch several screen objects, but the system responds as though only a single pixel is touched. In contact area interaction all objects under the finger respond to the touch. Users activate control widgets by sliding a movable element, as though flipping a switch. These Sliding Widgets resolve selection ambiguity and provide designers with a rich vocabulary of self-disclosing interaction mechanism. We showcase the design of several types of Sliding Widgets, and report study results showing that the simplest of these widgets, the Sliding Button, performs on-par with medium-sized pushbuttons and offers greater accuracy for small-sized buttons.},

abstract = {Current interactions on direct-touch interactive surfaces are often modeled based on properties of the input channel that are common in traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as x-y coordinate information. Leveraging additional information available on the surfaces could potentially result in richer and novel interactions. In this paper we specifically explore the role of finger orientation. This property is typically ignored in touch-based interactions partly because of the ambiguity in determining it solely from the contact shape. We present a simple algorithm that unambiguously detects the directed finger orientation vector in real-time from contact information only, by considering the dynamics of the finger landing process. Results of an experimental evaluation show that our algorithm is stable and accurate. We then demonstrate how finger orientation can be leveraged to enable novel interactions and to infer higher-level information such as hand occlusion or user position. We present a set of orientation-aware interaction techniques and widgets for direct-touch surfaces.},

Compared to traditional interactive surfaces, our 2.5 dimensional interface system enables direct touch interaction and soft tactile feedback. In this paper we present our force sensing technique using photoelasticity and describe the implementation of our prototype system.

The new system incorporates many interaction aspects of perspective drawing with judicious automation to enable novices with no perspective training to proficiently create 3D curve sketches. EverybodyLovesSketch supports a number of novel interactions: tick-based sketch plane selection, single view definition of arbitrary extrusion vectors, multiple extruded surface sketching, copy-and-project of 3D curves, freeform surface sketching, and an interactive perspective grid. Finally, we present a study involving 49 high school students (with no formal artistic training) who each learned and used the system over 11 days, which provides detailed insights into the popularity, power and usability of the various techniques, and shows our system to be easily learnt and effectively used, with broad appeal.},

abstract = {Rotate-Scale-Translate (RST) interactions have become the de facto standard when interacting with two-dimensional (2D) contexts in single-touch and multi-touch environments. Because the use of RST has thus far focused almost entirely on 2D, there are not yet standard techniques for extending these principles into three dimensions. In this paper we describe a screen-space method which fully captures the semantics of the traditional 2D RST multi-touch interaction, but also allows us to extend these same principles into three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Just like RST allows users to directly manipulate 2D contexts with two or more points, our method allows the user to directly manipulate 3D objects with three or more points. We show some novel interactions, which take perspective into account and are thus not available in orthographic environments. Furthermore, we identify key ambiguities and unexpected behaviors that arise when performing direct manipulation in 3D and offer solutions to mitigate the difficulties each presents. Finally, we show how to extend our method to meet application-specific control objectives, as well as show our method working in some example environments.},

abstract = {We describe our system called MobileASL for real-time video communication on the current U.S. mobile phone network. The goal of MobileASL is to enable Deaf people to communicate with Sign Language over mobile phones by compressing and transmitting sign language video in real-time on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, which has a weak processor, uses limited bandwidth, and has little battery capacity. We develop several H.264-compliant algorithms to save system resources while maintaining ASL intelligibility by focusing on the important segments of the video. We employ a dynamic skin-based region-of-interest (ROI) that encodes the skin at higher quality at the expense of the rest of the video. We also automatically recognize periods of signing versus not signing and raise and lower the frame rate accordingly, a technique we call variable frame rate (VFR).We show that our variable frame rate technique results in a 47% gain in battery life on the phone, corresponding to an extra 68 minutes of talk time. We also evaluate our system in a user study. Participants fluent in ASL engage in unconstrained conversations over mobile phones in a laboratory setting. We find that the ROI increases intelligibility and decreases guessing. VFR increases the need for signs to be repeated and the number of conversational breakdowns, but does not affect the users' perception of adopting the technology. These results show that our sign language sensitive algorithms can save considerable resources without sacrificing intelligibility.},

Although with these representations a user might be able to visually identify elements of sounds in a mixture, they do not facilitate object-specific editing (e.g. selecting only the voice of a singer in a song). This interface uses audio guidance from a user in order to select a target sound within a mixture. The user is asked to vocalize (or otherwise sonically represent) the desired target sound, and an automatic process identifies and isolates the elements of the mixture that best relate to the user's input. This way of pointing to specific parts of an audio stream allows a user to perform audio selections which would have been infeasible otherwise.},

abstract = {In this paper, we extrapolate the evolution of mobile devices in one specific direction, namely miniaturization. While we maintain the concept of a device that people are aware of and interact with intentionally, we envision that this concept can become small enough to allow invisible integration into arbitrary surfaces or human skin, and thus truly ubiquitous use. This outcome assumed, we investigate what technology would be most likely to provide the basis for these devices, what abilities such devices can be expected to have, and whether or not devices that size can still allow for meaningful interaction. We survey candidate technologies, drill down on gesture-based interaction, and demonstrate how it can be adapted to the desired form factors. While the resulting devices offer only the bare minimum in feedback and only the most basic interactions, we demonstrate that simple applications remain possible. We complete our exploration with two studies in which we investigate the affordance of these devices more concretely, namely marking and text entry using a gesture alphabet.},

abstract = {One of the challenges with using mobile touch-screen devices is that they do not provide tactile feedback to the user. Thus, the user is required to look at the screen to interact with these devices. In this paper, we present SemFeel, a tactile feedback system which informs the user about the presence of an object where she touches on the screen and can offer additional semantic information about that item. Through multiple vibration motors that we attached to the backside of a mobile touch-screen device, SemFeel can generate different patterns of vibration, such as ones that flow from right to left or from top to bottom, to help the user interact with a mobile device. Through two user studies, we show that users can distinguish ten different patterns, including linear patterns and a circular pattern, at approximately 90% accuracy, and that SemFeel supports accurate eyes-free interactions.},

Additionally, screen occlusion can be reduced by moving interaction off of the display and into unused space around the device. We discuss several example applications as a proof of concept. Finally, results from our user study indicate radial targets as small as 16 degrees can achieve greater than 92% selection accuracy, outperforming comparable radial, touch-based finger input.},

abstract = {Triggering shortcuts or actions on a mobile device often requires a long sequence of key presses. Because the functions of buttons are highly dependent on the current application's context, users are required to look at the display during interaction, even in many mobile situations when eyes-free interactions may be preferable. We present Virtual Shelves, a technique to trigger programmable shortcuts that leverages the user's spatial awareness and kinesthetic memory. With Virtual Shelves, the user triggers shortcuts by orienting a spatially-aware mobile device within the circular hemisphere in front of her. This space is segmented into definable and selectable regions along the phi and theta planes. We show that users can accurately point to 7 regions on the theta and 4 regions on the phi plane using only their kinesthetic memory. Building upon these results, we then evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype of the Virtual Shelves using a Nokia N93. The results show that Virtual Shelves is faster than the N93's native interface for common mobile phone tasks.},

Coupled with each micro-projector is a camera to enable hand gesture tracking, object recognition, and information transfer within the projected space. Thus, Bonfire is neither a pure laptop system nor a pure tabletop system, but an integration of the two into one new nomadic computing platform. This integration (1) enables observing the periphery and responding appropriately, e.g., to the casual placement of objects within its field of view, (2) enables integration between physical and digital objects via computer vision, (3) provides a horizontal surface in tandem with the usual vertical laptop display, allowing direct pointing and gestures, and (4) enlarges the input/output space to enrich existing applications. We describe Bonfire's architecture, and offer scenarios that highlight Bonfire's advantages. We also include lessons learned and insights for further development and use.},

abstract = {Although interactive surfaces have many unique and compelling qualities, the interactions they support are by their very nature bound to the display surface. In this paper we present a technique for users to seamlessly switch between interacting on the tabletop surface to above it. Our aim is to leverage the space above the surface in combination with the regular tabletop display to allow more intuitive manipulation of digital content in three-dimensions. Our goal is to design a technique that closely resembles the ways we manipulate physical objects in the real-world; conceptually, allowing virtual objects to be 'picked up' off the tabletop surface in order to manipulate their three dimensional position or orientation. We chart the evolution of this technique, implemented on two rear projection-vision tabletops. Both use special projection screen materials to allow sensing at significant depths beyond the display. Existing and new computer vision techniques are used to sense hand gestures and postures above the tabletop, which can be used alongside more familiar multi-touch interactions. Interacting above the surface in this way opens up many interesting challenges. In particular it breaks the direct interaction metaphor that most tabletops afford. We present a novel shadow-based technique to help alleviate this issue. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our technique based on our own observations and initial user feedback, and provide various insights from comparing, and contrasting, our tabletop implementations},

In ARC-Pad we combine ab-solute and relative cursor positioning. Tapping with ARC-Pad causes the cursor to jump to the corresponding location on the screen, providing rapid movement across large distances. For fine position control, users can also clutch using relative mode. Unlike prior hybrid cursor positioning techniques, ARC-Pad does not require an explicit switch between relative and absolute modes. We compared ARC-Pad with the relative positioning commonly found on touchpads. Users were given a target acquisition task on a large display, and results showed that they were faster with ARC-Pad, without sacrificing accuracy. Users welcomed the benefits associated with ARC-Pad.},

From our experience using fNIRS technology for HCI, we identify several considerations and provide guidelines for using fNIRS in realistic HCI laboratory settings. We empirically examine whether typical human behavior (e.g. head and facial movement) or computer interaction (e.g. keyboard and mouse usage) interfere with brain measurement using fNIRS. Based on the results of our study, we establish which physical behaviors inherent in computer usage interfere with accurate fNIRS sensing of cognitive state information, which can be corrected in data analysis, and which are acceptable. With these findings, we hope to facilitate further adoption of fNIRS brain sensing technology in HCI research.},

abstract = {We are at an important technological inflection point. Most of our computing systems have been designed and built by professionally trained experts (i.e. us--computer scientists, engineers, and designers) for use in specific domains and to solve explicit problems. Artifacts often called "user manuals" traditionally prescribed the appropriate usage of these tools and implied an acceptable etiquette for interaction and experience. A fringe group of individuals usually labeled "hackers" or "nerds" have challenged this producer-consumer model of technology by hacking novel hardware and software features to "improve" our research and products while a similar creative group of technicians called "artists" have re-directed the techniques, tools, and tenets of accepted technological usage away from their typical manifestations in practicality and product. Over time the technological artifacts of these fringe groups and the support for their rhetoric have gained them a foothold into computing culture and eroded the established power discontinuities within the practice of computing research. We now expect our computing tools to be driven by an architecture of open participation and democracy that encourages users to add value to their tools and applications as they use them. Similarly, the bar for enabling the design of novel, personal computing systems and "hardware remixes" has fallen to the point where many non-experts and novices are readily embracing and creating fascinating and ingenious computing artifacts outside of our official and traditionally sanctioned academic research communities.But how have we as "expert" practitioners been influencing this discussion? By constructing a practice around the design and development of technology for task based and problem solving applications, we have unintentionally established such work as the status quo for the human computing experience. We have failed in our duty to open up alternate forums for technology to express itself and touch our lives beyond productivity and efficiency. Blinded by our quest for "smart technologies" we have forgotten to contemplate the design of technologies to inspire us to be smarter, more curious, and more inquisitive. We owe it to ourselves to rethink the impact we desire to have on this historic moment in computing culture. We must choose to participate in and perhaps lead a dialogue that heralds an expansive new acceptable practice of designing to enable participation by experts and non-experts alike. We are in the milieu of the rise of the "expert amateur".We must change our mantra: "not just usability but usefulness and relevancy to our world, its citizens, and our environment".We must design for the world and what matters.This means discussing our computing research alongside new keywords such as the economy, the environment, activism, poverty, healthcare, famine, homelessness, literacy, religion, and politics.This talk will explore the design territory and potential opportunities for all of us to collaborate and benefit as a society from this cultural movement.},

abstract = {Time-series graphs are often used to visualize phenomena that change over time. Common tasks include comparing values at different points in time and searching for specified patterns, either exact or approximate. However, tools that support time-series graphs typically separate query specification from the actual search process, allowing users to adapt the level of similarity only after specifying the pattern. We introduce relaxed selection techniques, in which users implicitly define a level of similarity that can vary across the search pattern, while creating a search query with a single-gesture interaction. Users sketch over part of the graph, establishing the level of similarity through either spatial deviations from the graph, or the speed at which they sketch (temporal deviations). In a user study, participants were significantly faster when using our temporally relaxed selection technique than when using traditional techniques. In addition, they achieved significantly higher precision and recall with our spatially relaxed selection technique compared to traditional techniques.},

abstract = {While onboard navigation systems are gaining in importance, maps are still the medium of choice for laying out a route to a destination and for way finding. However, even with a map, one is almost always more comfortable navigating a route the second time due to the visual memory of the route. To make the first time navigating a route feel more familiar, we present a system that integrates a map with a video automatically constructed from panoramic imagery captured at close intervals along the route. The routing information is used to create a variable speed video depicting the route. During playback of the video, the frame and field of view are dynamically modulated to highlight salient features along the route and connect them back to the map. A user interface is demonstrated to allow exploration of the combined map, video, and textual driving directions. We discuss the construction of the hybrid map and video interface. Finally, we report the results of a study that provides evidence of the effectiveness of such a system for route following.},

abstract = {Asynchronous collaborators often use freeform ink annotations to point to visually salient perceptual features of line charts such as peaks or humps, valleys, rising slopes and declining slopes. We present a set of techniques for interpreting such annotations to algorithmically identify the corresponding perceptual parts. Our approach is to first apply a parts-based segmentation algorithm that identifies the visually salient perceptual parts in the chart. Our system then analyzes the freeform annotations to infer the corresponding peaks, valleys or sloping segments. Once the system has identified the perceptual parts it can highlight them to draw further attention and reduce ambiguity of interpretation in asynchronous collaborative discussions.},

abstract = {The Web is a dynamic information environment. Web content changes regularly and people revisit Web pages frequently. But the tools used to access the Web, including browsers and search engines, do little to explicitly support these dynamics. In this paper we present DiffIE, a browser plug-in that makes content change explicit in a simple and lightweight manner. DiffIE caches the pages a person visits and highlights how those pages have changed when the person returns to them. We describe how we built a stable, reliable, and usable system, including how we created compact, privacy-preserving page representations to support fast difference detection. Via a longitudinal user study, we explore how DiffIE changed the way people dealt with changing content. We find that much of its benefit came not from exposing expected change, but rather from drawing attention to unexpected change and helping people build a richer understanding of the Web content they frequent.},

abstract = {Interaction with large unstructured datasets is difficult because existing approaches, such as keyword search, are not always suited to describing concepts corresponding to the distinctions people want to make within datasets. One possible solution is to allow end users to train machine learning systems to identify desired concepts, a strategy known as interactive concept learning. A fundamental challenge is to design systems that preserve end user flexibility and control while also guiding them to provide examples that allow the machine learning system to effectively learn the desired concept. This paper presents our design and evaluation of four new overview based approaches to guiding example selection. We situate our explorations within CueFlik, a system examining end user interactive concept learning in Web image search. Our evaluation shows our approaches not only guide end users to select better training examples than the best performing previous design for this application, but also reduce the impact of not knowing when to stop training the system. We discuss challenges for end user interactive concept learning systems and identify opportunities for future research on the effective design of such systems.},

abstract = {Dido is an application (and application development environment) in a web page. It is a single web page containing rich structured data, an AJAXy interactive visualizer/editor for that data, and a "metaeditor" for WYSIWYG editing of the visualizer/editor. Historically, users have been limited to the data schemas, visualizations, and interactions offered by a small number of heavyweight applications. In contrast, Dido encourages and enables the end user to edit (not code) in his or her web browser a distinct ephemeral interaction "wrapper" for each data collection that is specifically suited to its intended use. Dido's active document metaphor has been explored before but we show how, given today's web infrastructure, it can be deployed in a small self-contained HTML document without touching a web client or server.},
