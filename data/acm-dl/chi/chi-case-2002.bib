abstract = {The goal of this project was to design a site that would make the online process of joining the Columbia House Music or DVD club faster and easier. Faced with low conversion rates from online advertising, our challenge was to quickly solve the main problems with the existing join process, which were identified through user testing and site data logs.In response we designed a separate mini-site that reduced the entire process to 3 steps (and as many pages). The Club-based ecommerce experience is unique: the number of products a user selects is fixed, allowing us to implement a unique and transparent interaction model for the shopping cart design.The project was extremely successful. Conversion rates increased 180%. The design work for this project then set direction for subsequent visual and interface design projects for Columbiahouse.com.},

abstract = {This case study explores the evolution of the Franklin Content Management System, developed by IBM's Internet Technology Group. Franklin began as a technology-driven process to provide a web content management solution with the following goals: content reusability, simplified management of content and design that enforces integrity and consistency, the customization of content to individual users, and the delivery of content to a variety of display devices.These goals were met in part by the decomposition of information into reusable fragments represented in XML. This approach provides unique opportunities in a content management system. However, it also raises some interesting challenges in the deployment of such a tool and the education of its users.The development of Franklin evolved over a two year period and has culminated in the deployment of 62 country portals within the ibm.com domain. Furthermore, concepts from the Franklin project are influencing the strategy and design of IBM offerings.},

abstract = {Organizations large and small continuously strive to improve strategic decision-making. Strategic decision-making (distinguished from operational decision making) involves making substantial investments of resources over long periods of time before results are evident. These decisions are made using quantitative and qualitative information - experience, intuition, and subjective assessment. These are people decisions, not decisions made by machines.So, how can data interfaces be designed to support these most critical decisions of the organization?This case study looks at approaches taken with one R&amp;D (research and development) client to address their key strategic decisions: whether to move research efforts into the next stage of development or cancel the project. We will discuss how we've used web-based interface technologies to create visual metaphors for data including: visualizing time, collaborating, and modeling scenarios. We'll also demonstrate approaches to embedding more abstract constructs like decision theory, statistical analysis, and competitive advantage into these interfaces.},

abstract = {SHS.com (Shared Healthcare Systems) provides software solutions and services for the senior healthcare market. In 1998, SHS engaged Cooper to help design a next-generation healthcare information system that would for the first time provide true integration of clinical, financial, and case management information, allowing comprehensive management of long-term healthcare facilities.Cooper had an opportunity to design a product that not only improved the efficiency of healthcare facilities, but also helped improve the quality of care given to their residents. The system needed to help facility staff make sense of data as well as capture it.To address these important issues, Cooper interviewed and observed healthcare facility staff and residents during an intensive ethnographic research period. The research and analysis culminated in a set of user archetypes, called personas. The team used persona- and scenario-based methods to drive the design of an integrated suite of clinical, case management, and financial tools.},
