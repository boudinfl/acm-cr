abstract = {The Web, as envisaged by its inventors, was founded on the idea of hyperlinks. Derived from the notion of hypertext in literary theory, a hyperlink is a relation rather than an object. It is a system of connections that connects distant pieces of text, resulting in a non-linear, open, active, decentralized, and diverse space we called the World Wide Web. But in the past few years, and with the rise of closed social networks, as well as mobile apps, the hyperlink - and thereby the Web - are in serious trouble. Most social networks have created a closed, linear, centralized, sequential, passive, and homogeneous space, where users are encouraged to stay in all the time -- a space that is more like television.The Web was imagined as an intellectual project that promoted knowledge, debate, and tolerance; as something I call library-internet. Now it has become more about entertainment and commerce; I call this tv-internet.},

abstract = {User modeling and adaptation had its inception as a field at a workshop in Maria Laach, Germany in 1986. Most of the work at that time focused on applications in natural language processing, such as adapting explanations to the user's level of expertise. Since then, the field has grown tremendously and new applications are arising each year. As appropriate for the 30th anniversary of the first workshop, this talk will discuss how the field has evolved, novel work that we are pursuing on applying user modeling and adaptation to information retrieval, insights into where the field is headed and the hottest topics for exploration, and some thoughts on the conflict between the benefits of user modeling and its intrusion on people's lives.},

We study how people specify and use reminders. Our study analyzes a sample of six months of logs of user-specified reminders from Cortana (Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant), the first large-scale analysis of such reminders. We focus our analyses on time-based reminders, the most common type of reminder found in the logs. We perform a data-driven analysis to identify common categories of tasks that give rise to these reminders across a large number of users, and we arrange these tasks into a taxonomy. We identify temporal patterns linked to the type of task, time of creation, and terms in the reminder text. Finally, we show that these patterns generalize by addressing a prediction task. Specifically, we show that a reminder's creation time is a strong feature in predicting the notification time, and that including the reminder text further improves prediction accuracy. The results have implications for the design of systems aimed at helping people to complete tasks and to plan future activities.},

abstract = {The collaborative filtering (CF) approach in recommender systems assumes that users' preferences are consistent among users. Although accurate, this approach fails on some users. We presume that some of these users belong to a small community of users who have unusual preferences, such users are not compliant with the CF underlying assumption. They are grey sheep users. This paper aims at accurately identifying grey sheep users. We introduce a new distribution-based grey sheep users identification technique, that borrows from outlier detection and from information retrieval, while taking into account the specificities of preference data on which CF relies: extreme sparsity, imprecision and users' bias. The experimental evaluation conducted on a state-of-the-art dataset shows that this new distribution-based technique outperforms state-of-the-art grey sheep users identification techniques.},

abstract = {Most research in recommender systems is focused on the problem of identifying and ranking items that are relevant for the individual users but unknown to them. The potential value of such systems is to help users discover new items, e.g., in e-commerce settings. Many real-world systems however also utilize recommendation lists for a different goal, namely to remind users of items that they have viewed or consumed in the past. In this work, we aim to quantify the value of such reminders in recommendation lists ("recominders"), which has to our knowledge not been done in the past. We first report the results of a live experiment in which we applied a naive reminding strategy on an online platform and compare them with results obtained through different offline analyses. We then propose more elaborate reminding techniques, which aim to avoid reminders of too obvious or of already outdated items. Overall, our results show that although reminders do not lead to new item discoveries, they can be valuable both for users and service providers.},

abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the best machine learning approaches for decision making in interactive environments. RL focuses on inducing effective decision making policies with the goal of maximizing the agent's cumulative reward. In this study, we investigated the impact of both immediate and delayed reward functions on RL-induced policies and empirically evaluated the effectiveness of induced policies within an Intelligent Tutoring System called Deep Thought. Moreover, we divided students into Fast and Slow learners based on their incoming competence as measured by their average response time on the initial tutorial level. Our results show that there was a significant interaction effect between the induced policies and the students' incoming competence. More specifically, Fast learners are less sensitive to learning environments in that they can learn equally well regardless of the pedagogical strategies employed by the tutor, but Slow learners benefit significantly more from effective pedagogical strategies than from ineffective ones. In fact, with effective pedagogical strategies the slow learners learned as much as their faster peers, but with ineffective pedagogical strategies the former learned significantly less than the latter.},

We collected a data set of teacher audio and human-coded instructional activities (e.g., lecture, question and answer, group work) in 76 middle school literature, language arts, and civics classes from eleven teachers across six schools. We automatically segment teacher audio to analyze speech vs. rest patterns, generate automatic transcripts of the teachers' speech to extract natural language features, and compute low-level acoustic features. We train supervised machine learning models to identify occurrences of five key instructional segments (Question &amp; Answer, Procedures and Directions, Supervised Seatwork, Small Group Work, and Lecture) that collectively comprise 76% of the data. Models are validated independently of teacher in order to increase generalizability to new teachers from the same sample. We were able to identify the five instructional segments above chance levels with F1 scores ranging from 0.64 to 0.78.

abstract = {This study examines how accurately individual student differences in learning can be predicted from prior student learning activities. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) predicts learner performance well and has often been employed to implement cognitive mastery. Standard BKT individualizes parameter estimates for knowledge components, but not for learners. Studies have shown that individualizing parameters for learners improves the quality of BKT fits and can lead to very different (and potentially better) practice recommendations. These studies typically derive best-fitting individualized learner parameters from learner performance in existing data logs, making the methods difficult to deploy in actual tutor use. In this work, we examine how well BKT parameters in a tutor lesson can be individualized based on learners' prior performance in reading instructional text, taking a pretest, and completing an earlier tutor lesson. We find that best-fitting individual difference estimates do not directly transfer well from one tutor lesson to another, but that predictive models incorporating variables extracted from prior reading, pretest and tutor activities perform well, when compared to a standard BKT model and a model with best-fitting individualized parameter estimates.},

abstract = {Affective support is crucial during learning, with recent evidence suggesting it is particularly important for female students. Facial expression is a rich channel for affect detection, but a key open question is how facial displays of affect differ by gender during learning. This paper presents an analysis suggesting that facial expressions for women and men differ systematically during learning. Using facial video automatically tagged with facial action units, we find that despite no differences between genders in incoming knowledge, self-efficacy, or personality profile, women displayed one lower facial action unit significantly more than men, while men displayed brow lowering and lip fidgeting more than women. However, numerous facial actions including brow raising and nose wrinkling were strongly correlated with learning in women, whereas only one facial action unit, eyelid raiser, was associated with learning for men. These results suggest that the entire affect adaptation pipeline, from detection to response, may benefit from gender-specific models in order to support students more effectively.},

abstract = {To persuade people to buy a product or service online, they must be visually convinced and attracted to use the sales website. Thus, there is need to understand how different user groups perceive various designs of websites for better adaptation. A lot of research has shown that users' judgment of the credibility of a website is critical to its success. However, in the mobile domain, little has been done empirically to 1) investigate users' credibility perception of a website; and 2) how it changes as the user interface (UI) design is systematically altered. This paper bridges this gap by carrying out sentiment and statistical analyses of users' perceptions of four systematically modified mobile websites among 285 subjects from North America, Africa and Asia. The results show that mobile website design affects the perception of its credibility, with 1) females being more critical and sensitive to UI changes than males; and 2) the grid-layout website design preferred to the list-layout website design by both genders. The study contributes to knowledge in three ways. First, it provides a concise model for understanding users' UI perceptions, expectations and gender differences. Second, it presents important findings that will enable a gender-based mobile website adaptation. Third, it provides a set of empirically backed guidelines for mobile web design.},

We asked patients to imagine they are in that situation and rate validated reminders based on Cialdini's 6 principles of persuasion for their suitability. Participants then chose their favourite reminder, and an alternative reminder to send if that one failed. We found that persuasive reminders that use `Authority' and 'Liking' are the most popular overall. We also found that personality had an effect when deciding on the type of persuasive reminder to use. In particular, we have found that those with high emotional stability are more responsive to any kind of persuasion, those with low agreeableness rated all types of reminder higher than those with high, and that conscientiousness matters when selecting an alternative reminder.},

The game is a simple, single-player matching game in which players attempt to match movies with their friends. It has been developed as a Facebook app and harnesses the social graph and likes of players as a source of game data.

In this paper, we show that affective features such as customer's and agent's personality traits and emotion expression improve prediction of customer satisfaction when added to more typical text based features. We only utilize information extracted from the first customer conversation turn and previous customer and agent social network activity. Thus, our customer satisfaction classifier outputs its prediction in an early stage of the conversation, before any interaction has taken place between the customer and an agent. Our model was trained and tested on a Twitter conversations dataset of two customer support services, and shows an improvement of 30% in F1-score for predicting dissatisfaction.},

They are, however, plagued by two issues that threaten their future: learner engagement and learner retention. MOOCs regularly attract tens of thousands of learners, though only a very small percentage complete them successfully. In the traditional classroom setting, it has been established that personality impacts different aspects of learning. It is an open question to what extent this finding translates to MOOCs: do learners' personalities impact their learning &amp; learning behaviour in the MOOC setting? In this paper, we explore this question and analyse the personality profiles and learning traces of hundreds of learners that have taken a EX101x Data Analysis MOOC on the edX platform. We find learners' personality traits to only weakly correlate with learning as captured through the data traces learners leave on edX.},

As part of an automatic gesture training system, we propose to model the co-evolution between a student and a training environment in order to provide personalized action selection. The proposed approach is based on three models representing the student, the environment, and the interactions between these two entities. The latter model sees the PAS as a multi-armed bandit problem, each arm representing a possible action. Thus, PAS personalization only relies on the interactions between the student and the learning environment, without any prior knowledge. Two experiments, one in a simulated environment and a second in a calligraphy training environment, highlight the model ability to personalize action selection, and the benefits of this ability on students skill acquisition.},

abstract = {Various e-learning systems that provide electronic textbooks are gathering data on large numbers of student reading interactions. This data can potentially be used to model student knowledge acquisition. However, reading activity is often overlooked in canonical student modeling. Prior studies modeling learning from reading either estimate student knowledge at the end of all reading activities, or use quiz performance data with expert-crafted knowledge components (KCs). In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamic modeling of student knowledge is feasible and that automatic text analysis can be applied to save expert effort. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic student modeling in textbook-based learning. We formulate the problem of modeling learning from reading as a reading-time prediction problem, reconstruct existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explore two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent semantic-based) to build the KC model. We evaluate the proposed framework using a dataset collected from a Human-Computer Interaction course. Results show that our approach for reading modeling is plausible; the proposed Knowledge Tracing-based student model reliably outperforms baselines and the latent semantic-based approach can be a promising way to construct a KC model. Serving as the first step to model dynamic knowledge in textbook-based learning, our framework can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personalized learning.},

abstract = {Many collaborative filtering recommender systems collect and use users' explicitly entered preferences in the form of ratings for items. However, in many real world scenarios, this form of feedback can be difficult to obtain or unavailable (e.g., news portals). In this case recommendations must be built by leveraging more abundant implicit feedback data, which only indirectly signal users' preferences or opinions. A record in such datasets is a result of an action performed by a user on an item (e.g., the item was clicked or viewed). State-of-the-art implicit feedback recommender systems predict whether the user will act on a target item and interpret this prediction as a discovered preference for the item. These models are trained by observations of user actions of one single type. For instance, they predict that a user will watch a video using a dataset of observed video watch actions. In this paper we conjecture that multiple types of user actions may be jointly exploited to predict one target type of actions. We present a general prediction model (MMF - Multiple action types Matrix Factorization) that implements this conjecture and we illustrate some practical examples. The empirical evaluation of MMF, which was conducted on a large real world dataset, shows that using multiple actions is beneficial and it can outperform a state-of-the-art implicit feedback model that uses only the target action data.},

It has been shown that such critiquing feedback can effectively improve users' decision quality, especially in complex decision environments such as e-commerce, tourism, and finance. However, because its explicit elicitation process unavoidably demands extra user efforts, the application in real situations is limited. In this paper, we report an eye-tracking experiment with the objective of studying the relationship between users' eye gazes as laid on recommended items and their critiquing feedback. The results indicate the feasibility of inferring users' feedback based on their eye movements. It hence points out a promising roadmap to developing unobtrusive eye-based feedback elicitation for recommender systems.},

Our approach enables users to manipulate their preference profile expressed implicitly in the (intransparent) factor space through explicitly presented tags. Furthermore, it seems helpful in cold-start situations since user preferences can be elicited via meaningful tags instead of ratings. We evaluate this approach and present a user study that to our knowledge is the most extensive empirical study of tag-enhanced recommending to date.

We investigated user- and item-based Collaborative Filters, and compared their performance with that of global and demographic RS baselines. We then developed a technique based on Principal Components Analysis to select a subset of the original survey questions that supports the prediction of users' ratings for device-task combinations. Our results show that the accuracy of an RS that asks only a small subset of the survey questions is similar to that of an RS that predicts users' answers to one survey question on the basis of their answers to all the other questions.},

abstract = {In exploratory search tasks, users usually start with considerable uncertainty about their search goals, and so the search intent of the user may be volatile as the user is constantly learning and reformulating her search hypothesis during the search. This may lead to a noticeable concept drift in the relevance feedback given by the user. We formulate a Bayesian regression model for predicting the accuracy of each individual user feedback and thus find outliers in the feedback data set. To accompany this model, we introduce a timeline interface that visualizes the feedback history to the user and gives her suggestions on which past feedback is likely in need of adjustment. This interface also allows the user to adjust the feedback accuracy inferences made by the model. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the performance of the new user model outperforms a simpler baseline and that the performance approaches that of an oracle, given a small amount of additional user interaction. A user study shows that the proposed modeling technique, combined with the timeline interface, made it easier for the users to notice and correct mistakes in their feedback, resulted in better and more diverse recommendations, allowed users to easier find items they liked, and was more understandable.},

Building on this, we carry out and report on an analysis of 1008 MovieLens users with identified personality profiles. We find that Introverts and low Agreeableness users are more likely to survive into the second and subsequent sessions compared to their respective counterparts; Introverts and low Conscientiousness users are a significantly more active population compared to their respective counterparts; High Openness and High Neuroticism users contribute (tag) significantly more compared to their counterparts, but their counterparts consume (browse and bookmark) more; and low Agreeableness users are more likely to rate whereas high Agreeableness users are more likely to tag. These results show how modeling newcomer behavior from user personality can be useful for recommender systems designers as they customize the system to guide people towards tasks that need to be done or tasks the users will find rewarding and also decide which users to invest retention efforts in.},

Further, we show that, using a set of 88 features, the gender of the cooks can be predicted with fairly good accuracy of 75%, with preference for particular dishes, the use of spices and the use of kitchen utensils being the strongest predictors.

However, all approaches in the domain of research paper recommendation have used explicit social relations that users have initiated which has the problem of low recommendation coverage. We argued that the available data in social bookmarking Web sites such as CiteULike or Mendeley could be exploited to connect similar users using implicit social connections based on their bookmarking behavior. In this paper, we proposed three different implicit social networks-readership, co-readership, and tag-based and we compared the recommendation accuracy of several recommendation algorithms using data from the proposed social networks as input to the recommendation algorithms. Then, we tested which implicit social network provides the best recommendation accuracy. We found that, for the most part, the social recommender is the best algorithm and that the readership network with reciprocal social relations provides the best information source for recommendations but with low coverage. However, the co-readership network provide good recommendation accuracy and better user coverage of recommendation.},

In order to exploit the natural graph-based structure of RDF data, we study the impact of the knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation algorithm. In more detail, we investigate whether the integration of LOD-based features improves the effectiveness of the algorithm and to what extent the choice of different feature selection techniques influences its performance in terms of accuracy and diversity. The experimental evaluation on two state of the art datasets shows a clear correlation between the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize a specific evaluation metric. Moreover, the graph-based algorithm leveraging LOD-based features is able to overcome several state of the art baselines, such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, thus confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We formulate two feasibility-tailored recommendation strategies that utilize the Rasch model. The engagement maximization strategy aims at maximizing the probability of engagement by proposing very feasible behaviors while the motivation maximization strategy aims to challenge users by matching the difficulty of the advice with the ability of the user, thereby maximizing motivation. In an online study (N=150) we assessed user preference for either strategies (embodied as virtual coaches) in comparison with a random control strategy. Our results show that coaches selecting feasible health advice resonate better with the patient than control. In general patients significantly preferred the engagement maximization strategy over random advice on most factors, while patients with a medium level of ability significantly preferred the motivation maximization strategy on all factors.},

Context-aware recommender systems go further, incorporating the variability of users' preferences across contexts, and suggesting items that are appropriate in different contexts. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation task, "Context Suggestion", whereby the system recommends contexts in which items may be selected. We introduce the motivations behind the notion of context suggestion and discuss several potential solutions. In particular, we focus specifically on user-oriented context suggestion which involves recommending appropriate contexts based on a user's profile. We propose extensions of well-known context-aware recommendation algorithms such as tensor factorization and deviation-based contextual modeling and adapt them as methods to recommend contexts instead of items. In our empirical evaluation, we compare the proposed solutions to several baseline algorithms using four real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Recommender systems provide personalized information based on a user's preferences. Differences in preferences among users are estimated from past records such as click logs or purchase logs. Recommender systems typically assume that users will respond to recommendations, provided that their favorite items are correctly selected. However, the responsiveness to recommendations depends on the type of users; while some users might be easily persuaded to take action, others might be more hesitant. In this paper, we propose a purchase prediction model that incorporates the differences in the responsiveness. We derived the individual users' responsiveness from a combination of purchase logs and recommendation logs. Improvement in the accuracy of purchase prediction was verified using a grocery shopping dataset. Another relatively unexplored yet important objective of recommender algorithms is to maximize recommendation impact, which is defined as the increase in purchase probability through recommendations. The impact of recommendations by our model exceeded that of a conventional model that ignores individual users' responsiveness. These results demonstrate the importance of modeling the responsiveness of individual users. In cases where recommendation logs are insufficient, the responsiveness needs to be estimated from other sources. Consequently, we investigated the correlation of the responsiveness with user attributes and item attributes. The estimates of the responsiveness from the correlated attributes outperformed the mean estimates. Furthermore, the recommendation impact of the model estimated from the correlated attributes was almost comparable to that of the model estimated from recommendation logs. These findings can help overcome the cold-start problem of inadequate recommendation logs. Our study presents a new direction in the field of personalization based on the responsiveness to recommendations.},

abstract = {A large body of research in recommender systems focuses on optimizing prediction and ranking. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of other aspects of the recommendations, including transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, we introduce MoodPlay, a hybrid recommender system music which integrates content and mood-based filtering in an interactive interface. We show how MoodPlay allows the user to explore a music collection by latent affective dimensions, and we explain how to integrate user input at recommendation time with predictions based on a pre-existing user profile. Results of a user study (N=240) are discussed, with four conditions being evaluated with varying degrees of visualization, interaction and control. Results show that visualization and interaction in a latent space improve acceptance and understanding of both metadata and item recommendations. However, too much of either can result in cognitive overload and a negative impact on user experience.},

abstract = {Playlist generation is a special form of music recommendation where the problem is to create a sequence of tracks to be played next, given a number of seed tracks. In academia, the evaluation of playlisting techniques is often done by assessing with the help of information retrieval measures if an algorithm is capable of selecting those tracks that also a human would pick next. Such approaches however cannot capture other factors, e.g., the homogeneity of the tracks that can determine the quality perception of playlists. In this work, we report the results of a multi-metric comparison of different academic approaches and a commercial playlisting service. Our results show that all tested techniques generate playlists with certain biases, e.g., towards very popular tracks, and often create playlists continuations that are quite different from those that are created by real users.},

However, it is often unknown how much diversity a recommendation set needs to consist of. In this work, we explored how music users of Last.fm apply diversity in their listening behavior. We analyzed a dataset with the music listening history of 53,309 Last.fm users capturing their total listening events until August 2014. We complemented this dataset with The Echo Nest features and Hofstede's cultural dimensions to explore how music diversity is applied across countries. Between 47 countries, we found distinct relationships between the cultural dimensions and music diversity variables. These results suggest that different country-based diversity measurements should be considered when applied to a recommendation set in order to maximize the user's subjective evaluations. The country-based relationships also provide opportunities for recommender systems to personalize experiences when user data is limited by being able to rely on the user's demographics.},

Specifically, a user (an item) can be influenced (characterized) by her preferred categories (the categories it belongs to) in the hierarchy. We incorporate how different categories in the hierarchy co-influence a user and an item. Empirical results show the superiority of our approach against other counterparts.},

abstract = {Digital games can be potent problem solving environments which afford discovery learning through thoughtful exploration [1, 2]. As such, game microworlds facilitate self-regulated learning through sandbox elements in which students have agency in individualizing their pathways of interaction [3]. These agency-driven environments can support learning via individual discovery of problem space constraints and solutions, particularly through boundary testing and productive failure [cf. 4]. Thus, modeling of user interaction in digital learning games can provide considerable insight into emergent trajectories of discovery-based progression, in which equally engaged players may interact differently with the system. To this end, this research leverages educational data mining (EDM) [5] to investigate organic player trajectories of thoughtful exploration (around boundary testing and productive failure) in a learning gamespace. We align behavioral coding with log file data to automatically detect sequences of thoughtful exploration (TE) in play. Results include a robust predictive model of event-stream TE, with multiple trajectories of emergent student behavior-offering insight into organic learning pathways through the game-based problem space, and informing iterative design in optimization of user experience and student engagement.},

Videos of students will be annotated by third-party observers as mind wandering (disengaged) or not mind wandering (engaged). Automatic detectors will also be trained to classify the same videos based on students' facial features, and compared to the machine predictions. These detectors will then be improved by engineering features to capture facial expressions noted by observers and more heavily weighting training instances that were exceptionally-well classified by observers. Finally, implications of previous results and proposed work are discussed.},

Student populations are at risk due to their sedentary lifestyles and the high demands of academic scholarship, leaving them with little or no time to exercise. Recently, persuasive technology, promoting physical activity, has been proposed. However, the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach has not been effective among the student population. This calls for a newer and more effective approach, which leverages the available recreational and technological resources in the university at personal, social and cultural levels. In an effort to address students' sedentary behaviors, I aim to combine user behavior models, persuasive technology design and cultural strategies from Health Sciences for a more personalized and effective intervention. This paper presents the approach and the preliminary results of two user studies among 218 and 292 subjects from a Canadian and a Nigerian university respectively.},

abstract = {Traditional Knowledge Tracing, which traces students' knowledge of each decomposed individual skill, has been a popular learner model for adaptive tutoring. Typically, a student is guided to the next skill when the student's knowledge on current skill is inferred as mastery. Unfortunately, this traditional approach no longer suffices to model complex skill practices where simple decompositions can not capture potential additional skills underlying the context as a whole. In such cases, mastery should only be granted when a student not only understands the basic of a skill but also can fluently apply a skill in varied application contexts. In this thesis, we aim to propose a data-driven approach to construct learner models considering different skill application contexts for tracing deeper knowledge, primarily based on Bayesian Networks. We aim to conduct novel, comprehensive, ``deep" evaluations, including internal data-drive evaluations, and external end-user evaluations examining the real world impact for students' personalized learning.},

abstract = {Open Learner Models (OLM) have demonstrated a multitude of benefits supporting metacognition and engaging learners. Although researchers have study different representations of OLM, a broader view that situates OLM in Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is missing. An important element in SRL that can bring a better understanding of these tools and their effects concerns to learning motivation theories. In this work I connect these aspects and propose to study the effects of OLM and motivational factors drawn from learning motivation theories. To account for a broader spectrum of OLM representations, I proposed to explore the addition of social information and different levels of granularity in the OLM. I propose to evaluate different designs and then to evaluate the resulting interface in field studies. With the proposed work I expect to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of OLM tools which can be used to guide the development of better tools, better personalization and adaptive mechanisms, better use of such tools in supporting Self-Regulated Learning, and ultimately impact positively in learning.},

abstract = {User modeling for individual users on the Social Web plays a significant role and is a fundamental step for personalization as well as recommendations. Previous studies have proposed various user modeling strategies in different dimensions such as (1) interest representation, (2) interest propagation, (3) content enrichment and (4) temporal dynamics of user interests. This research mainly focuses on the first two dimensions interest representation and propagation. In addition, we also investigate the combination of these four dimensions and their synergistic effect on the quality of user modeling. Different user modeling strategies will then be evaluated in the context of personalized link recommender systems using standard evaluation methodologies such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), recall (R@N) and success (S@N) at rank N.},

abstract = {This PhD research aims to integrate group decision making into a personality based recommender systems in a domain with complex and emotional products i.e., e-tourism domain. In this domain, decisions, especially in groups, are often non rational. Based on the ongoing research on picture-based recommender systems at the e-commerce group, TU Wien and the software of Pixtri OG, the research will develop new methods to model group recommendations and support emotion-aware group decision processes, based on and evaluated by a world-wide study.},

abstract = {The main goal of recommender systems is to help users to filter all the information available by suggesting items they may like without they had to find them by themselves. Although the rating prediction is a pretty well controlled topic, being able to make a recommendation at the right moment still remain a challenging task. To this end, most researches try to integrate contextual information (weather, mood, location of users, etc.) in the recommendation process. Even if this process increases users satisfaction, using personal information faces with users' privacy issues. In a different way, our approach is only giving credits to the evolution of diversity within the recent history of consultations, allowing us to automatically detect implicit contexts. In this paper, we will discuss the scientific challenges to be overcome to take maximum advantage of those implicit contexts in the recommendation process.},
