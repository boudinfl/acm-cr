abstract = {We present a method to form a co-located group with detection of relative position using camera image, for enabling a user to share digital content instantly. The method uses only incorporated components on a mobile device without using peripheral devices such as RGB-D camera and independent of work environment or arrangement of users. Location of each user is detected based on the value of the on-device accelerometer and gyroscope. This provides a user highly co-located interaction anywhere. We also implement a collaborative Web search tool to which method is applied for supporting collaborative work through Web search.},

abstract = {The use of handheld tablet computer devices by health care professionals is nowadays ubiquitous. However, when used by the physician in a patient consultation context, the experience perceived by the patient may be less than optimal because the technology and UIs have been designed for the physician's use, not for collaborative patient-physician situations. Typically, the device may create a barrier, reducing eye contact between the two parties, whilst providing no directly perceivable benefits to the patient. We present a functional implementation of a dual sided tablet where the back of the tablet presents constructive information to the patient during the consultation. We describe our initial exploration into the user interface and content that may be applied to such a device and context of use.},

In two studies crowd users reported their ability to express emotions with the Moodsource image browsers and with text. Cognitive styles theories suggest users can be visual or verbal thinkers; crowd users preferring images thought they could express emotions equally well with abstract images as with text. Designer users "reading" the visual feedback reported that it represented the perceived mood from their designs and were inspired to make improvements.},

Through the analytic results, we confirmed that direct emotional exchange is reduced by more than half when smartphones are used.

While there are many digital solutions for collaborative affinity diagram, they have not been widely adopted due to usability challenges, so may teams still revert back to traditional method of sticky notes for their affinity diagramming activities. We proposed Distributed Affinity Diagram System (DADS) to solve the existing usability problems and present a more usable solution compared with the traditional method. DADS proposes a dual-screen terminal that divides private input screen from common interactive screen in each user's setup. While private input encourages users to create and nurture ideas, common interactive spaces are designed to sync all users' actions across all terminals, allowing users to collaborate interactively through a distributed multi-touch system. The separation of input space and the distributed synchronized interactive space can improve usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction.},

Students are provided with numerous short tutorials which instruct them in choosing a topic and developing a manageable concept for their dissertation project. New tools have been created to facilitate the formulation process by integrating large discipline-specific corpora from which users can derive linguistic support through an integrated open source corpus analysis tool. The system also supports collaborative processes between writers, peers, tutors, and supervisors.

The quest for prominence and recognition on social media sites like Twitter can sometimes eclipse accuracy and lead to the spread of false information. As a way to study and react to this trend, we demo TWITTERTRAILS, an interactive, web-based tool (twittertrails.com) that allows users to investigate the origin and propagation characteristics of a rumor and its refutation, if any, on Twitter. Visualizations of burst activity, propagation timeline, retweet and co-retweeted networks help its users trace the spread of a story. Within minutes TWITTERTRAILS will collect relevant tweets and automatically answer several important questions regarding a rumor: its originator, burst characteristics, propagators and main actors according to the audience. In addition, it will compute and report the rumor's level of visibility and, as an example of the power of crowdsourcing, the audience's skepticism towards it which correlates with the rumor's credibility. We envision TWITTERTRAILS as valuable tool for individual use, and especially for amateur and professional journalists investigating recent and breaking stories.},

Using the lenses of gender, recovery, and performance, our proposed panel explores the tensions that emerge when the richness and complexity of individual personalities and subjectivities run up against design norms that imagine identity as simplistic or one-dimensional. These models of identity not only limit the ways individuals can express their own identities, but also establish norms for other users about what to expect, causing further issues when the inevitable dislocations do occur. We discuss the challenges in translating identity into these systems, and how this is further marred by technical requirements and normative logics that structure cultures and practices of databases, algorithms and computer programming.},

The relative positions are then used for identifying the recipient of transferred data by performing a swipe on the screen of the sending device towards the physical direction of the recipient. Shuriken is built upon the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) framework and only uses built-in sensors of typical smart devices. Users link their devices by pointing them towards each other to form a group and to create a BLE connection. The received radio signal strength and the digital compass readings are obtained and then distributed to estimate the relative positions of the devices. Additional devices can be included in an existing group by performing the same action with any device in the group. Devices in the group can perform data transfer and the data is passed through linked devices in a multi-hop approach. We envision practical uses of Shuriken in collaborative shopping in a caf\'{e}, data transfer in business meetings and localisation of multiple smart devices that are in close proximity. To the best of our knowledge, Shuriken is the first approach that performs user grouping and data transfer based on the inter-device relative positions calculated from sensor readings available in off-the-shelf smart devices.},

abstract = {Online communities have become a prevailing cyberspace for people to communicate, collaborate, share information and experiences. Their high reliance on user-generated content makes their success tied to the continuous flow of newcomers and their subsequent effort. Our previous study suggested that newcomers' introductions positively affect their subsequent effort. In the current work, we identified two different introduction strategies in terms of the presence of initial participation before introduction to the community. Our analysis of these two strategies shows that providing introduction after some initial participation in the community has significant positive associations with newcomers' commitment to the community.},

To have a better understanding of the economics in domestic settings, it is very important to study the ways money and financial issues are collaboratively handled within families. Using an ethnographic approach, we studied the everyday financial practices of fifteen middle-income families. Our preliminary results show that there is a strong tendency to live frugally; that, people apply various and creative mechanisms to minimize their expenses and save money seemingly irrespectively of their income. To this end we highlight some implications for designing technologies to support household financial practices.},

Specifically, we assess the extent to which users are incentivized by earned badges in their contributions to the answering activity. Our initial results present strong empirical evidence that confirms the value of the badges and the effectiveness of gamification in stimulating voluntary participation.},

In spite of the increasing research effort in recent years, the beneficial effects of CQA systems have not been fully discovered in organizational and educational environments yet. We present a novel concept of an organization-wide educational CQA system that fills the gap between open and too restricted class communities of learners. In order to evaluate its feasibility, we designed CQA system Askalot. Askalot was experimentally evaluated during a summer term at our university with more than 600 users. The results of the experiment provide an insight into employment of CQA systems as nontraditional learning environments that utilize a diversity of students' knowledge in a whole organization.},

Besides the well-recognized room features like price, minimum stay, and amenities, our result shows that social features such as responsiveness of host, count of Wish List, number of reviews, and membership seniority are significantly associated with room sales. On the other hand, some of the conventional social features such as overall rating and number of references turned out to be not so critical for room sales.},

This experimental study examines, whether computer-supported awareness about the preferences of all team members (i.e. Preference Awareness) can foster accurate joint priorities within a team. 150 participants were randomly assigned to teams of three members with different preferences in either a condition with or without Preference Awareness. The team members had to prepare jointly for an upcoming negotiation via audio conference and afterwards were asked for their priorities for the negotiation. The stated priorities in the condition with preference awareness covered the preferences of all team members significantly better than in the condition without awareness.},

abstract = {Sustaining remote communication across generations is a continuing problem, due to the increasing popularity of online communication. Participation in online platforms is advantageous for seniors wishing to connect with younger generations, yet reciprocity on these platforms is a challenge for older adults. Barriers include the cognitive overload of existing mainstream interfaces and a lack of engaging content. In this paper we propose Pinteresce, a tool leveraging family-generated reminiscence prompts to encourage seniors' participation in the online community, Pinterest. The system provides an intuitive interface for communicating across age groups to promote reciprocal engagement with online content.},

However, there is little agreement on a standard model for researching the performance of distributed teams. Initial pilot results suggest that the Multiple Errands Test (MET), when adapted to a team in a virtual environment, is a platform for evaluating the impact of feedback characteristics. To demonstrate the potential of the Team MET as a platform for future team research in the broader CSCW community, an example study is described in which team members are given feedback in one of four conditions: individual private, team private, individual public, and team public.},

abstract = {Wood represents a form of renewable energy that is widely available. In rural Mexico it represents the main source of energy. It is used not only for cooking, but also to heat houses, and to provide lighting. Most Mexican villagers use wood via stoves, however these appliances usually bring health hazards and are harmful for the environment. Due to these problems new technologies, such as efficient stoves, have been implemented to bring better combustion, reduce amount of smoke, and overall make the transfer of heat more efficient. However, the social adoption of efficient stoves is non-trivial. Our study shows how making efficient stoves follow the guidelines of appropriate technology, we can: 1) successfully understand the cultural and social aspects of how villagers use renewable energy; 2) design technology that by considering a region's traditions, is used long term.},

We aim to create a publicly accessible repository of infrastructuring tools and to facilitate the cross-pollination of ideas about technology in local contexts among the researchers, practitioners, and residents interested in this area. At the workshop, participants will collaborate with Vancouver's residents and technology practitioners in order to explore the past, present, and future of research in this space; co- construct an infrastructuring tools repository; discuss key information challenges of local communities; and brainstorm solutions and opportunities to address them. Discussion and ideas generated will be archived online to be available to the larger research community and to local community advocates and activists.},

For CSCW, these apps are interesting to study: they offer a context to explore issues of identity and self-presentation, geography and locality, privacy and security, as well as motivation and usage habits. In this one-day workshop, we invite researchers, students, and practitioners from a diverse range of backgrounds, including CSCW, computer science, sociology, and public health, to discuss these issues and more, as well as to explore the difficulties and challenges inherent in this research. In addition to exploring the issues around apps for sex and dating, participants will also help to bring some of these sensitive, yet important topics into the mainstream of CSCW research.},

As we get set for this event, it is paramount to enroll a broader number of CSCW researchers in Latin America (LA) in the broader CSCW community. CSCW research in LA has been active since the mid 1990's although largely disconnected from the broader international CSCW. It is critical to acknowledge this history and collectively understand how the CSCW community can learn from CSCW in LA and how LA researchers can be better represented in and integrated into international CSCW. The goal of this workshop is twofold. First, to provide a forum for researchers working in LA to present their work for the international CSCW community, and second, to allow the international CSCW community to understand the issues around doing CSCW research in LA. Senior discussants will be invited to discuss the work of LA researchers and introduce key issues from their regions, therefore facilitating the cross-region conversations among participants.},

abstract = {Co-located environments have long been considered ideal for many types of group work, such as planning, decision-making, and design, since they provide a rich communication environment (e.g. delay-free voice communication, face-to-face interaction, eye gaze, and non-verbal communication), as well as promote awareness and coordination through the use of shared artifacts. However, the recent move towards multi-device ecologies in co-located settings, such as the use of multiple personal devices (e.g., laptops, tablets) or multiple personal devices in conjunction with larger, shared displays, such as digital walls or tabletops, can interfere with these common co-located communication and collaboration strategies, as various group members mentally and/or physical shift their focus to their personal devices rather than to their collaborators or to any physically shared artifacts. Group communications and coordination can easily breakdown in these scenarios as the lack of a physically shared group focus of attention can limit awareness of other's activities and task progress. In this workshop, researchers and practitioners will explore design techniques that can be used to address this issue, and improve group awareness in these co-located multi-device ecologies. This will be accomplished through group presentations, brainstorming sessions, and small-group breakout sessions.},
