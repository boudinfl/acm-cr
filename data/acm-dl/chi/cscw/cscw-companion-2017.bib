abstract = {The success of crowdsourcing markets is dependent on a strong foundation of trust between workers and requesters. In current marketplaces, workers and requesters are often unable to trust each other's quality, and their mental models of tasks are misaligned due to ambiguous instructions or confusing edge cases. This breakdown of trust typically arises from (1) flawed reputation systems which do not accurately reflect worker and requester quality, and from (2) poorly designed tasks. In this demo, we present how Boomerang and Prototype Tasks, the fundamental building blocks of the Daemo crowdsourcing marketplace, help restore trust between workers and requesters. Daemo's Boomerang reputation system incentivizes alignment between opinion and ratings by determining the likelihood that workers and requesters will work together in the future based on how they rate each other. Daemo's Prototype tasks require that new tasks go through a feedback iteration phase with a small number of workers so that requesters can revise their instructions and task designs before launch.},

An evaluation with 87 participants shows that ConsensUs helps individuals identify points of disagreement within groups and leads people to align their scores more with the group opinion. We discuss the larger design space for supporting the group consensus process, and our future directions to extend this approach to large-scale decision making platforms.},

Promoting senior engagement in the workforce is essential to enhancing senior QOL and mitigating aging-related problems of society by maintaining and encouraging their health, strength, and skills. We argue that we need an innovative matching system of senior workers to jobs. However, effective and appropriate matching and retrieval methods have not been established. We will first introduce four user interfaces that extract user information and label jobs. Then, we will examine the algorithm used to match workers with jobs and to update work profiles. Based on our theory, we built an online consumer-to-consumer/provider matching platform, GBER, where senior workers can find local jobs. We analyzed the log data we collected through our pilot study in Kashiwa, Japan, over seven month with 92 senior users. Our results demonstrated a viable approach to increasing senior involvement in their communities.},

We conducted an online survey (n=101), to understand the effectors on developers' professional privacy attitudes and practices.

In addition, foster parents struggle with managing the high-risk online behavior of their foster teens. The purpose of this paper is to present our early findings to help unpack the challenges and the problem context for online safety for "at-risk" adolescents in the foster care system.},

Because patients' priorities often reflect their values-things important and meaningful in their lives-it is important to incorporate values into patient-provider conversations. However, patients often withhold values from providers when they do not perceive them to be pertinent. In a field study with 24 patients with multiple chronic conditions, we sought to understand how participants perceived relationships among their values and their health concerns. We found that participants felt overwhelmed by multiple concerns, but were able to surmount these feelings when they pursued values that were linked to self-care. We discuss implications for patient-provider communication to help patients link values with self-care practices.},

Using a combination of theory and iterative design thinking, we describe design strategies to address these needs. This study informs research beyond our specific context by providing an approach to technology design that supports development of community-driven nature projects.},

Remixing reduces learners' path dependence, enabling them to diverge from their work on early assignments. Remixing also gives learners an up-close look at other approaches to the same project. Finally, remixing provides the opportunity to practice the real-world skill of elaborating upon the work of others.

abstract = {Gravity Spy is a citizen science project that draws on the contributions of both humans and machines to achieve its scientific goals. The system supports the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) by classifying "glitches" that interfere with observations. The system makes three advances on the current state of the art: explicit training for new volunteers, synergy between machine and human classification and support for discovery of new classes of glitch. As well, it provides a platform for human-centred computing research on motivation, learning and collaboration. The system has been launched and is currently in operation.},

abstract = {People are collaborating remotely through an increasing number of digital channels with the aid of platforms such as video conferencing and VR/AR. Despite new ways of conducting interpersonal conversations, the method and technologies associated with note taking remain the same. Moreover, note taking can be seen as distracting to all of the participants involved and disrupt the flow of conversation. Nonetheless, note taking is a significant method for people to augment their own memory by selectively categorizing information as valuable and storing it through text or audio for future reference. We propose a system that integrates video teleconferencing interactions with notes as selected through unobtrusive eye tracking cues and foot-based gestures. Our system aids in the augmentation of human memory via note taking while increasing the quality of social interaction amongst all the interaction's participants.},

Through conducting an inductive research of 123 virtual employees and 428 office employees of one high-technology company, we eventually identified a few unique virtual-featured OCBs and compared the OCBs in globally distributed teams and on-site teams respectively. Surprisingly, we also found the behaviors of virtual members generally have larger impacts on the team, than on-site colleagues do. The ongoing research is currently developing a scale of OCBs in virtual context, which would serve for future explorations.},

The main elements of the training include computer-supported communication and coordination, more hands-on training, and shorter trainee-trainer meetings.

However, the type of information that effectively recommends a product is not clearly understood. To allow consumers to select an optimal product, it is necessary to understand the human purchasing model and discover an interface design that can effectively present information. It has been predicted that pages that include negative eWOM facilitate trust toward the system, although cognitive resources are required to process the information. The results of a controlled experiment show that participants who encountered negative eWOM and have less cognitive load could developed higher trust toward the product and were motivated to purchase it. This study implies that cognitive factors such as access to negative eWOM are important for developing trust and motivating product buying behavior. It contributes to determining when negative eWOM can be effective and provides new knowledge about developing consumer buying models on the web.},

This study investigates the influence of data that is presented by a robotic system on human judgment in a sentence estimation situation in court. The study includes an experiment in which participants played the role of a juror in a sentence estimation task. Participants were presented with scripts of the case, reference materials regarding similar cases, and sentences given by the expert robotic system and human, and then, determined an adequate sentence based on this information. Results show that participants interacting with the robotic system tend to agree with the presented material (in the same way as with human experts) when it is adequate. This result shows that robotic systems are treated the same way as humans, and that intelligent systems can be a reliable source of information for human decision-making in court. Moreover, the results show that robotic systems may, in some cases, be considered more trustworthy than humans.},

Scholars annotate on their research resources to reflect impressions, insights and facts, as well as reduce the cognitive load in their working memory as a prerequisite for carrying out such sensemaking processes. Given the data-intensive nature of research and the increased collaboration of often interdisciplinary working teams, a vast amount of annotations with a great extent of knowledge are produced daily. However, the annotation tools extant do not usually support sensemaking of those annotations. Using existing research as a foundation, we define a conceptual model for collaborative sensemaking that is based on human-machine collaboration. We introduce concepts to integrate machine intelligence into the collaborative sensemaking process by allowing users to interact with machine-recommended information in favor of exploring knowledge from collective intelligence through interactive visualizations of annotations.},

However most concerns of impact are about quality of career/work, knowledge/awareness of the world, and quality of social ties and less about basics such as food, water and electricity.

Especially, technology has changed the way that those distinct parts of a person's life intermingle. Previous work has largely focused on different styles of work-life balance, and most of the industry contributions to this problem focus on preventing work tasks from leaking into one's personal life. However, little work has been done to investigate the ways that personal tasks impact the work day. We present the results of a survey of 93 employed people, as they relate to personal tasks that people do at work. We consider the context, consequences, and persistency of these tasks, and propose some design implications that could better reinforce the individual boundaries that people have between their work and personal lives.},

With Puzzle Space, couples move puzzle pieces on a table surface where movements are shown on the remote partner's screen.

Pokemon Go provides a practical case to observe potential new connections between the affinity spaces and learning in place-based settings. In this study, we look at design considerations for connecting learning in online affinity spaces to physical places. We discuss learner usage of Pokemon Go, learner designs for similar technology and impacts on interaction between place, affinity space and self. Specifically, we show that learners desire connecting affinity space learning to place by using finely-detailed, context-sensitive connections so that they can reflect place back to their affinity space visibly and possibly tangibly. Interestingly, social interactions serve to strengthen the bonds between people and interest in the physical places and learners do not require an extensive technological social feature.},

ADEs have become a leading cause of outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and unplanned admissions to hospital. Many of these events are not strictly pharmacological, but rather are related to practical challenges in the coordination of care,prescribing, dispensing, and medication use, and may be preventable with new modes of documentation and communication for medication management. Action ADE is a CSCW intervention that aims to enable communication of patient ADE information across healthcare settings in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Implementing Action ADE requires negotiations of political agendas and policy change, evolving medical information system infrastructures, and the needs and practices of clinicians and patients. As the initial design phase for Action ADE comes to a close and we enter into our first phase of piloting and implementation, this poster provides a snapshot of five domains in which our project intervenes and highlights findings from our extensive qualitative work.},

Workers on virtual labor marketplaces accelerate this process by generating training data for AI systems. We propose a new model where workers earn ownership of trained AI systems, allowing them to draw a long-term royalty from a tool that replaces their labor. This concept offers benefits for workers and requesters alike, reducing the upfront costs of model training while increasing longer-term rewards to workers. We identify design and technical problems associated with this new concept, including finding market opportunities for trained models, financing model training, and compensating workers fairly for training contributions. A survey of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk about this idea finds that workers are willing to give up 25% of their earnings in exchange for an investment in the future performance of a machine learning system.},

This work points to an information framework for online personae for distance learners. We also discuss the design implications for helping distance learners to uncover meaningful but hidden connections within virtual learning communities.},

abstract = {Recently, a new type of social network called event-based social network(EBSN) is emerging to promote real-time online to offline social interactions. On the other hand, Danmaku (Danmu) is becoming increasingly popular on video sharing sites in Asia. Danmu creates a one to many social experiences suitable for EBSNs. It enables real-time commentary and serves as a valuable source for further analyzing social networks. In this poster, we use Danmu to create real-time online to offline event based social network. A method for analyzing user's activity via Danmu is proposed. Finally, we conclude that Danmu is effective in promoting EBSN by presenting the results of analyzing Danmu contents gathered by a social network App called "USee" on three social events.},

We apply theories from organizational population ecology to investigate whether similar petitions compete for signatures. We use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify topical niches. Using these niches, we test two theories from population ecology on 442,109 Change.org petitions. First, we find evidence for density dependence, an inverse-U-shaped relationship between the density of a petition's niche and the number of signatures the petition obtains. This suggests e-petitioning is competitive and that e-petitions draw on overlapping resource pools. Second, although resource partitioning theory predicts that topically specialized petitions will obtain more signatures in concentrated populations, we find no evidence of this. This suggests that specialists struggle to avoid competition with generalists.},

Numbers of people are willing to be physically active for long periods of time to catch the Pok\'{e}mons. Further, the medical and public health communities are also curious if this game has triggered more active levels of sustainable Physical Activity (PA) or behavior changes for health benefits. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a critical analysis of Pok\'{e}mon Go players' experience from an online survey filled in by 32 participants. The goal of this survey is to get a glimpse of Pok\'{e}mon Go players' motivation, their play patterns and experience, and an understanding of their self-reported behavior changes and concerns. The results revealed both negative and positive outcomes of the gamification approach Pok\'{e}mon Go adopted.},

InCircle was introduced in a language and culture class at university in Japan in order to boost up out-of-class interaction among students and to enhance learning opportunities out-of-class.

We propose that interactive playgrounds are vehicles for playful cooperation when robots are integrated into the system as cooperative co-players. We developed the Hatch 'em all game, wherein children are encouraged to hatch eggs cooperatively with a robot, and tested the effect of the robot's cooperative behavior on the children. We found that when the robot played cooperatively, children cooperated and helped the robot more than when the robot played selfishly. Our findings suggest that the social affordances of the playground, together with the social interactions between the children and the robot, enabled instances of team cooperation and prosocial behavior. Our work contributes to the CSCW community by opening a novel avenue for supporting children's cooperation, which could serve as a future testbed to investigate the role of robots in cooperative interaction},

In recent years, a number of initiatives across the world have applied crowdsourcing to contexts including constitutional reform, drafting federal bills, and generating local policies. However, crowd-civic systems also come with challenges and risks such as socio-technical barriers, marginalization of specific groups, silencing of interests, etc. Using a design-thinking approach, this workshop will address both opportunities and challenges of crowd-civic systems to develop best practices for increasing public engagement with law and policy. The workshop organizers will suggest an initial framework explicitly intended to be criticized by participants and reconfigured through a series of iterative cooperative small-group activities focusing on ``diagnosing'' the failures of past crowd-civic system efforts and the successes of online action around social issues. While the ultimate objective of the workshop is to develop a best practices guide, we see iterations on the guide as a mechanism for fostering community and collaboration among policymakers, technologists, and researchers around crowd-civic systems for law and policy.},

Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brings together researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events to consolidate research to-date, share practical experiences, and understand what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.},

Rather than strictly focusing on privacy as a state that is always desired--where more privacy is viewed unequivocally as "better"--we consider situations where privacy may not be optimal for researchers, end users, or society. We discuss the current research landscape, including the recent updates to the ACM's Code of Ethics, and how researchers and designers can make more informed decisions regarding ethics, privacy, and other competing values in privacy-related research and designs.

To date, research has documented examples of hugely successful citizen science projects, such as Zooniverse and eBird, but citizen science also includes hundreds of smaller citizen science and functionally similar digital humanities projects, operating from small-scale web platforms and in-person collaborative teams. Yet, it is unclear what the "science" of citizen science entails: What are the core research questions and methodologies for answering them? What theories and concepts have been associated with citizen science research to date? What are the technology needs for supporting successful research collaboration among diverse stakeholders and across distinctive types of citizen science projects? In this workshop, our goal is to (i) bring together researchers studying citizen science to form a coherent map summarizing the theories, methodologies and platforms that currently defines citizen science research, with a special focus on CHI and CSCW relevant topics (ii) brainstorm a list of fundamental open questions and ways to tackle them, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the idea that robots could become an integral part of groups and teams has developed from a promising vision into a reality. Robots are increasingly designed to interact with groups and teams of people, yet most human-robot interaction research still focuses on a single humans interacting with a single robot. The goal for the workshop is therefore to advance research in computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human robot interaction (HRI) by raising awareness for the social and technical challenges that surround the placement of robots within work-groups and teams. The workshop will be organized around three central questions: (1) How do robots shape the dynamics of groups and teams in existing settings? (2) How does a robot's behavior shape how humans interact with each other in dyads and in larger groups and teams? (3) How can robots improve the performance of work groups and teams by acting on social processes? These core issues will be covered across a set of presentations that initiate in- depth discussions around each question to improve the quality of and support the growth of research in the CSCW community that focuses on the intersection of robots, groups, and teams.},

abstract = {The goal of this workshop is to facilitate a discussion around the ways in which research and design methods can be better tailored to support and engage underserved communities. We aim to create a publicly accessible repository of tools to support research and design efforts with underserved communities and to facilitate critical conversations about appropriate methods and solutions in this space. At the workshop, participants will collaborate with one another to explore their own as well as past, present, and future research and design initiatives with underserved communities; discuss challenges and lessons learned from using methods to facilitate technological development and creation among such populations; and brainstorm methods and solutions to address these challenges. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be archived online and made available to the larger research community.},

abstract = {Collaborative research practices are a highly interesting domain for CSCW. So far, CSCW has mainly focused on computation- and/or data-intensive research endeavors. Here, resources are typically pooled via common e-infrastructures for data access and processing, a set-up requiring additional layers of coordination. Such a focus largely foregrounds the sciences and other fields that rely on highly structured (or structure-able) data and the routinized processes of analysis. In contrast, in this one-day workshop we discuss the conditions and challenges characteristic of research collaboration in the qualitative social sciences and humanities (SSH). In particular, we examine the sociotechnical infrastructures that enable and support research practices that--in comparison with the collaborative paradigm of the natural sciences--tend to be less structured, compartmentalized, and routinized, but more fluid, flexible, and open-ended. The workshop seeks to collect empirical insights and design experiences, preparing the grounds for a comprehensive understanding of the role of e-infrastructures for collaborative research practices in SSH.},

abstract = {Many social media platforms provide features for commenting, which often provide affordances for people to give feedback to others. Around the theme of advancing research about online comments, this workshop aims to bring together a diverse range of researchers for cross-discipline community building and especially dedicated time for productive, early mixed-methods research. The workshop is structured around a research "hackathon," where participants actively work on producing initial stages of research, theory, and design related to a central dataset (in the case of this workshop, public comments from a historical reddit.com corpus). Participants will form collaborative teams to tackle questions of interest that move forward current thinking around online comment behaviors, participants, quality, and design. The one-day workshop is led by 5 researchers, and it will accommodate up to 32 participants.},

abstract = {This one-day workshop intends to bring together both academics and industry practitioners to explore collaborative challenges in speech interaction. Recent improvements in speech recognition and computing power has led to conversational interfaces being introduced to many of the devices we use every day, such as smartphones, watches, and even televisions. These interfaces allow us to get things done, often by just speaking commands, relying on a reasonably well understood single-user model. While research on speech recognition is well established, the social implications of these interfaces remain underexplored, such as how we socialise, work, and play around such technologies, and how these might be better designed to support collaborative collocated talk-in-action. Moreover, the advent of new products such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home, which are positioned as supporting multi-user interaction in collocated environments such as the home, makes exploring the social and collaborative challenges around these products, a timely topic. In the workshop, we will review current practices and reflect upon prior work on studying talk-in-action and collocated interaction. We wish to begin a dialogue that takes on the renewed interest in research on spoken interaction with devices, grounded in the existing practices of the CSCW community.},
