It is designed for use in the Colab, an experimental laboratory created at Xerox PARC to study computer support of cooperative real-time group problem-solving. Cognoter provides a multi-user interface and a structured meeting process. An annotated graph of ideas is built up by the group in three stages: brainstorming for idea generation, ordering for idea organization, and evaluation for choosing what will be finally be presented. Interesting aspects of Cognoter include direct spatial manipulation of ideas and their order relationships, support of parallel activity, and incremental progress toward a total ordering of ideas.},

abstract = {The increasing reliance on group decision-making in today's complex business environments and advances in microcomputer, telecommunications and graphic presentation technology have combined to create a growing interest in the design of group decision support systems (GDSS). Planning is an important group decision-making activity within organizations. Effective planning depends on the generation and analysis of innovative ideas. For this reason, the idea generation and management process has been chosen as the domain for the study of the design and implementation of a GDSS to support complex, unstructured group decision processes within organizations.The MIS Planning and Decision Laboratory has been constructed to provide a research facility for the study of the planning and decision process while top executives from a variety of organizations use the laboratory to conduct actual planning sessions for their organization. This paper presents the design of a system to support the idea generation and analysis process in organization planning. Results of research conducted in the MIS Planning and Decision Laboratory on the use of the Electronic Brainstorming system with over 100 planners from a variety of organizations are presented and discussed.The findings of the research indicate that computer brainstorming stimulates task oriented behavior, decreases group interactions and equalizes participation. Information presentation, network speed and typing skills of the upper level managers were identified as possible inhibitors of the idea generation process that must be considered in the design of the system and the methodology for its use. Planners using the GDSS reported high levels of satisfaction with the process and outcome of the planning sessions. They rated the computer as an important tool for idea generation and the computer brainstorming process as "Much Better" than manual brainstorming.},

abstract = {Many researchers have investigated and speculated about the link between information technology and organizational structure with very mixed results. This paper suggests that part of the reason for these mixed results is the coarseness of previous analyses of both technology and structure. The paper describes a new and much more detailed perspective for investigating this link. Using concepts of object-oriented programming from artificial intelligence, the information processing that occurs in organizations is characterized in terms of the kinds of messages people exchange and the ways they process those messages. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through the analysis of a case in which a reduction in levels of management is coupled with the introduction of a computer conferencing system. The detailed model developed for this case helps explain both macro-level data about thd changes in the organizational structure, and micro-level data about individuals' use of the system.},

This follows from the fact that copiers are elaborate assemblages of relatively simple mechanisms, and the problem in diagnosis is not so much the testing of components as keeping track of the tests and making sense of their results. The anecdotal re-telling of this narrative to one's associates constitutes the mechanism for incorporating the diagnostic experience into the community expertise. These anecdotes are remembered and used or referred to during the diagnosis of other difficult problems or when seeking help. Individual expertise is in part the ability to interpret the anecdotes, to abstract the information about the machine from the context of the story. The participation of the community in remembering and using these anecdotes gives the community the flexibility to adapt to the unforeseen problems which are necessarily part of the service function.},

abstract = {How information flows through an organization is important to many organizational processes. The information people receive influences the perceptions they have of the organization they work for and the tasks they are assigned. Electronic mail constitutes a new medium in organizational communication. It may alter some of the information flow in the organizations in which it is used. My analysis suggests that some new communication occurs in large organizations that have electronic mail. I suggest that this new communication occurs because the way electronic mail is organized allows people to find other people with common interests at a low cost to either party. This new communication creates links between people who would otherwise not share information. Granovetter's work on the significance of weak ties suggests that such connections may have substantial influence on the way in which behavior is shaped and constrained by one's network and in the manipulation of networks to achieve specific goals (1973, 1974). These processes are important to organizational socialization and problem solving, respectively. Other functions of large formal organizations may also be affected.},

abstract = {This paper argues that using a set of semi-structured message templates is surprisingly helpful in designing a variety of computer-based communication and coordination systems. Semi-structured messages can help provide automatic aids for: (1) composing messages to be sent, (2) selecting, sorting, and prioritizing messages that are received, (3) responding automatically to some messages, and (4) suggesting likely responses to other messages. The use of these capabilities is illustrated in a range of applications including electronic mail, computer conferencing, calendar management, and task tracking. The applications show how ideas from artificial intelligence (such as inheritance and production rules) and ideas from user interface design (such as interactive graphical editors) can be combined in novel ways for dealing with semi-structured messages. The final part of the paper discusses how communities can evolve a useful set of message type definitions.},

The paper first describes the AI knowledge representation technology upon which the tools are founded. It then discusses a knowledge-based approach to interface construction and illustrates how that approach would apply to detecting design conflicts and inconsistencies stemming from two different kinds of team communication failure. Next, we discuss a knowledge acquisition aid utilized within the interface construction paradigm, which also illustrates the same approach to supporting co-operative work. We conclude by reviewing four sources of difficulty in team design efforts which this approach seeks to address.},

abstract = {In designing computer-based systems, we work within a perspective that shapes the design questions that will be asked and the kinds of solutions that are sought. This paper introduces a perspective based on language as action, and explores its consequences for practical system design. The language/action perspective is contrasted to a number of other currently prominent perspectives, and is illustrated with an extended example based on studies of nursing work in a hospital ward. We show how it leads to particular analyses of that work, which reveal potentials for creating new designs that can make the work (and the workers) more effective.},

abstract = {Most computer-based aids for researchers and other workers have had individuals rather than groups or teams as their beneficiaries. This is unfortunate, since much work in business, government, and academia is performed by groups of people. In this paper we examine research collaborations as a particularly informative example of group work and propose a model of research collaboration that should provide guidance to those developing technology to support collaborative work. The model is based on 50 semi-structured interviews with researchers in psychology, management science, and computer science. It focuses on the problems in forming and maintaining personal relationships and completing tasks that researchers must solve to have a successful collaboration. These problems occur when collaborators are initiating projects, executing them, and documenting results.},

abstract = {Writing and drawing together on a common display often assist a working group in a task. For example,face-to-face groups have long enjoyed the richness of graphic communication found on blackboards. The spontaneous image manipulations which take place over time on a blackboard can be viewed as a text-graphic performance. A human performer generates and manipulates text and graphics for the purpose of assisting the working group in their task.The phenomenon of performed text-graphics presents opportunities for research in the area of computer-supported cooperative work. 1] Spontaneous generation demands a performing medium where the focus is on live manipulation of text and graphics. Design of a computer-based medium with enough agility and generality to support blackboard-like activity is a challenge for interface design. 2] Agility and generality must not be achieved at the expense of specializability. After a group has initially sketched an idea in text and graphics, then that same medium should also support refining the sketch according to formal schema. 3] The performing medium can also be used as a recording medium for studying image manipulation as part of the working group process.This paper presents a stepwise approach to the design of a performing medium for working group graphics. First, examples of non-computer text-graphics for groups are examined to get a preliminary idea of the underlying phenomenon: the performing of text-graphic manipulation to assist working groups. Next key features of that kind of text-graphic manipulation are isolated. Then, third, the architecture and behavior of a graphics editor providing those features is described.},

In particular, users should be able to invoke any application from within the framework of a conference, and programmers should be able to develop new applications without having to deal explicitly with conferencing issues. We present the basic architectural approachs to this problem and discuss an early experiment with one of them.},

In its strictest interpretation, it means that everyone can see the same written information and also where anyone else is pointing. We present several examples of multi-user interfaces that start from the WYSIWIS abstraction. In our attempts to build software support for collaboration in meetings, we have discovered that WYSIWIS is at once crucial and too inflexible in its strictest sense. WYSIWIS must be relaxed for all our software tools to better accommodate important interactions in meetings. Relaxations to WYSIWIS are characterized in terms of constraints on its four key dimensions: display space, time of display, subgroup population, and congruence of view.},

abstract = {As part of a thrust to improve communication and collaboration among geographically separated groups of engineers, Hewlett-Packard in 1984 investigated computer teleconferencing. Most of that year was devoted to selection, acquisition, and limited pilot use of one such system (CONFER II), which has since been made widely available in the company. Today 1800 HP employees have registered to use the system. Hundreds of people from 15 countries on five continents sign on daily to participate in more than 50 active conferences; hundreds of others have tried to use the system once or a few times and then given up.This paper describes Hewlett-Packard's experience with the introduction and use of this system; its role in the corporate communications environment; some examples of prominent successes and failures; some heuristics for how to make the best of the technology available today; and some suggestions for future capabilities that would make such systems more widely useful.},

In this paper we describe a theoretical framework which sheds some light on these relationships, and describe a real-life experiment in using advanced information technology to support strategic business unit management within a large corporation.},

Within this conceptual context, a prototypal software package, CHAOS-1, is presented. CHAOS-1 aims both at supporting the conversations and at improving coordination of the office activities.This paper discusses CHAOS-1 with respect to similar proposals, presents its overall architecture, shows some examples of its use and sketches its new releases under development.},
