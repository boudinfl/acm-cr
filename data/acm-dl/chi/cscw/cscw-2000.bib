abstract = {Video-based media spaces are designed to support casual interaction between intimate collaborators. Yet transmitting video is fraught with privacy concerns. Some researchers suggest that the video stream be filtered to mask out potentially sensitive information. While a variety of filtering techniques exist, they have not been evaluated for how well they safeguard privacy.In this paper, we analyze how a blur and a pixelize video filter might impact both awareness and privacy in a media space. Each filter is considered at nine different levels of fidelity, ranging from heavily applied filter levels that mask almost all information, to lightly applied filters that reveal almost everything. We examined how well observers of several filtered video scenes extract particular  awareness cues: the number of actors; their posture (moving, standing, seated); their gender; the visible objects (basic to detailed); and how available people look (their busyness, seriousness and approachability). We also examined the privacy-preserving potential of each filter level in the context of common workplace activities. Our results suggest that the blur filter, and to a lesser extent the pixelize filter, have a level suitable for providing awareness information while safeguarding privacy.},

abstract = {There has been relatively little research on the impact of different levels of video quality on users of multimedia communication systems. This paper describes a study examining the impact of two levels of video frame rate on pairs and groups of four engaged on a design task, looking at one particular aspect of communication, namely reference. It was found that a low frame rate made speakers more communicatively cautious, using longer descriptions and more elaborations to refer to pictures used in the task, possibly as a result of being less certain that they had been understood. This only occurred in the two party groups despite a prediction that groups of four would be affected most by the frame rate manipulation. This study shows that video quality can have subtle effects on communication and that identical levels of quality may have different effects depending on the situation.},

Adversarial collaboration requires that people with opposing goals (adversaries) come to agreement, usually producing a shared product that reflects the interests of the adversarial parties. Adversarial collaboration is characterized by secrecy, advocacy and discovery. To support this activity, software should provide flexible, selective sharing of awareness and access. These requirements contrast with conventional shared resource and awareness systems, which tend to assume cooperative collaboration, characterized by open processes and static membership lists. We illustrate these ideas in a redesign of our PeopleFlow research prototype.},

Contact Point is a web-based application that helps a business manage its relationships with its customers. It can also be used within a business as a means for managing the relationship between parts of the business. In this paper we describe a study of the applicability of Contact Point to the technical services organization and field personnel of a medical device manufacturer. We found that there were opportunities to potentially reduce call volume through Contact Point. We discovered, however, that the technical service representatives sometimes filled roles other than providing information in their telephone  conversations with field personnel. These functions included reassuring callers that the callers' answers to questions were correct, providing a rationale for information, and redirecting calls to other departments. The ability to share a document and collaborate in real time was viewed as very valuable. We also discovered that the field personnel need information from a variety of other people in order to do their jobs. These observations were used to enhance the next iteration of Contact Point and to develop strategies for the introduction of Contact Point to users.},

abstract = {Providing information about other users and their activites is a central function of many collaborative applications. The data that provide this "presence awareness" are usually automatically generated and highly dynamic. For example, services such as AOL Instant Messenger allow users to observe the status of one another and to initiate and participate in chat sessions. As such services become more powerful, privacy and security issues regarding access to sensitive user data become critical. Two key software engineering challenges arise in this context:Policies regarding access to data in collaborative applications have subtle complexities, and must be easily modifiable during a collaboration.Users must be able to have a high degree of confidence that the implementations of these policies are correct.In this paper, we propose a framework that uses an automated  verification approach to ensure that such systems conform to complex policies. Our approach takes advantage of VeriSoft, a recent tool for systematically testing implementations of concurrent systems, and is applicable to a wide variety of specification and development platforms for collaborative applications. we illustrate the key features of our framework by applying it to the development of a presence awareness system.},

Thelive addressbookis an application that helps users make more informed telephone calls and teleconferences, from anywhere, via their wireless PDA or desktop browser. Unlike other network-based address books, which maintain static information, the live addressbook can display dynamic information about where the recipient currently is (i.e., reach number), and how available he/she currently is for calls. The system accomplishes this by applying to telephony the "Buddy List" concepts made popular in Instant Messaging applications.

However, basic issues with the interfaces and data structures of most forms of chat limit their utility for use in formal interactions (like group meetings) and decision-making tasks.  In this paper, we discuss Threaded Text Chat, a program designed to address some of the deficiencies of current chat programs. Standard forms of chat introduce ambiguity into interaction in a number of ways, most profoundly by rupturing connections between turns and replies.  Threaded Chat presents a solution to this problem by supporting the basic turn-taking structure of human conversation. While the solution introduces interface design challenges of its own, usability studies show that users' patterns of  interaction in Threaded Chat are equally effective, but different (and possibly more efficient) than standard chat programs.},

DACIA is also applicable to non-mobile environments. We show its applicability to building groupware applications that can be reconfigured at run-time to adapt to changing user demands and resource constraints, for example, by relocating  services or introducing new services.

How should video presentations be designed for web access? How is video accessed and used online? Does optimal design for live and on-demand audiences conflict? We examined detailed behavior patterns of more than 9000 on-demand users of a large corpus of professionally prepared presentations. We find that as many people access these talks on-demand as attend live. Online access patterns differ markedly from live attendance. People watch less overall and skip to different parts of a talk. Speakers designing presentations for viewing on-demand should emphasize key points early in the talk and early within each slide, use slide titles that reveal the talk structure and are meaningful outside the flow of the talk. In some cases the recommendations conflict with optimal design for live audiences. The results also provide guidance in developing tools for on-demand multimedia authoring and use.},

Using specialized, high-end videoconferencing systems, these improved results have been shown to apply even when the students are in different locations (Distributed TVI, or DTVI). In this paper, we explore two issues in making DTVI-like scenarios widely supported at low cost. First, we explore design of a system that allows distributed individuals to collectively watch video using shared VCR controls such as play, pause, seek, stop. We show how such a system can be built on top of existing commercial technologies. Second, we explore the impact of four alternative discussion channels on student learning and interaction behavior.   The four channels-text chat, audioconferencing, videoconferencing, and face-to-face-have differing infrastructure requirements and costs. Our lab studies show that while text chat does not work, there is no significant difference in discussion behavior and learning between audioconferencing and videoconferencing. While lab studies have their limitations and long-term field studies need to be done, the preliminary results point to a low-cost way for a DTVI-like model to be deployed widely in the very near future.},

GestureMan was developed to satisfy these four requirements by using a mobile robot that embodies a remote instructors actions. The mobile robot mounts a camera and a remote control laser pointer on it. Based on the experiments with the system we discuss the advantage and disadvantage of the current implementation.

The different sensations experienced during voluntary walking and enforced walking give us different feelings. Also, the number of individuals involved can create a different feeling when walking. Networked computer-assisted walking can support and enhance these different experiences. In this paper, we introduce another walking style, the shared power-assisted voluntary walk, which is realized by a prototype networked locomotion system. This system can be used in tele-rehabilitation, which allows remote patients to share the sensation of walking. Also, it can be used to teach a group of patients rehabilitative walking. We developed two locomotion interfaces and connected them via a network. We developed enforced and semi-voluntary walking training systems using the shared walk environment and evaluated them with a series of experiments. operation integration process. In the second algorithm, thanks to deferred broadcast of operations to other sites, this process becomes even more simplified.},

abstract = {In real-time collaborative systems, replicated objects, shared by users, are subject to concurrency constraints. In order to satisfy these, various algorithms, qualified as op?timistic, [3, 5, 13, 17, 14, 15, 18], have been proposed that exploit the semantic properties of operations to serialize concurrent operations and achieve copy con?vergence of replicated objects. Their drawback is that they either re?quire a condition on user's operations which is hard to verify when possible to ensure, or they need undo?ing then redoing operations in some situations. The main purpose of this paper is to present two new algorithms that over?come these drawbacks. They are based upon the imple?mentation of a continuous global order which enables that condition to be released, and simplifies the operation inte?gration process. In the second algorithm, thanks to de?ferred broadcast of operations to other sites, this process becomes even more simplified.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how consistency can be ensured for replicated continuous interactive media, i.e., replicated media which change their state in reaction to user initiated operations as well as because of the passing of time. Typical examples for this media class are networked computer games and distributed VR applications. Existing approaches to reach consistency for replicated discrete interactive media are briefly outlined and it is shown that these fail in the continuous domain. In order to allow a thorough discussion of the problem, a formal definition of the term consistency in the continuous domain is given. Based on this definition we show that an important tradeoff relationship exists between the responsiveness of the medium and the appearance of short-term inconsistencies. Until now this tradeoff was not taken into consideration for consistency in the continuous domain, thereby severely limiting the consistency related fidelity for a large number of applications. We show that for those applications the fidelity can be significantly raised by voluntarily decreasing the responsiveness of the medium. This concept is called local lag. It enables the distribution of continuous interactive media that are more vulnerable to short-term inconsistencies than, e.g., battlefield simulations. We prove that the concept of local lag is valid by describing how local lag was successfully used to ensure consistency in a 3D telecooperation application.},

None of the existing solutions for group undo is able to support undoing any operation at any time with guaranteed success. In this paper, we contribute a novel group undo solution with such a capability.  The basic idea is to interpret an undo command as a concurrent inverse operation by means of operational transformation, so that an operation is always undoable regardless of its undo context. By separating undo policy from undo mechanism, multiple undo modes, such as single-step undo, chronological undo, and selective undo, can be supported in the same collaborative editing session.  In addition, solutions to known undo
puzzles are also   provided. A web-based group text editor using the proposed undo solution has been implemented and is accessible at: http://reduce.qpsf.edu.au.},

abstract = {WebSplitter symbolizes the union of pervasive multi-device computing and collaborative multi-user computing.  WebSplitter provides a unified XML framework that enables multi-device and multi-user Web browsing.  WebSplitter splits a requested Web page and delivers the appropriate partial view of each page to each user, or more accurately to each user's set of devices.  Multiple users can participate in the same browsing session, as in traditional conferencing groupware.  Depending on the access privileges of the user to the different components of content on each page, WebSplitter generates a personalized partial view.  WebSplitter further splits the partial view among the devices available to each user,  e.g. laptop, wireless PDA, projection display, stereo speakers, orchestrating a  composite presentation across the devices.  A wireless PDA can browse while remotely controlling the multimedia capabilities of nearby devices.  The architecture consists of an XML metadata policy file defining access privileges to XML tags on a Web page, a middleware proxy that splits XML Web content to create partial views, and a client-side component, e.g. applet, enabling user login and reception of pushed browsing data.  Service discovery finds and registers proxies, browsing sessions, and device capabilities.  We demonstrate the feasibility of splitting the different tags in an XML Web page to different end users browsers, and of pushing updates from the browsing session to heterogeneous devices, including a laptop and a PDA.},

People who make referrals fill key organizational roles that have been identified by CSCW and affiliated research. Expertise locating systems are not designed to replace people who fill these key organizational roles. Instead, expertise locating systems attempt to decrease workload and support people who have no other options. Recommendation systems are collaborative software that can be applied to expertise locating. This work describes a general recommendation architecture that is grounded in a field study of expertise locating. Our expertise recommendation system details the work necessary to fit expertise recommendation to a work setting.

However, current recommender systems are black boxes, providing no transparency into the working of the recommendation. Explanations provide that transparency, exposing the reasoning and data behind a recommendation. In this paper, we address explanation interfaces for ACF systems - how they should be implemented and why they should be implemented. To explore how, we present a model for explanations based on the user's conceptual model of the recommendation process. We then present experimental results demonstrating what components of an  explanation are the most compelling. To address why, we present experimental evidence that shows that providing explanations can improve the acceptance of ACF systems. We also describe some initial explorations into measuring how explanations can improve the filtering performance of users.},

This activity is characterized byemergence, where the participants' shared understanding develops gradually as they interact with each other and the source material. Our goal is to support collaborative interpretation by small, distributed groups. To achieve this, we first observed how face-to-face groups perform collaborative interpretation in a particular work context. We then synthesized design principles from two relevant areas: the key behaviors of people engaged in activities where emergence occurs, and how distributed groups work together over visual surfaces. We built and evaluated a system that supports a specific collaborative interpretation task. This system provides a large workspace and several objects that encourages emergence in interpretation. People manipulatecardsthat contain the raw information fragments. They reduce complexity by placing duplicate cards intopiles. They suggest groupings as they manipulate the spatial layout of cards and piles. They enrich spatial layouts throughnotes, textandfreehand annotations. They record their understanding of their final groupings asreportscontaining coherent descriptions.},

We use both survey data and data from the change management system to measure the extent of delay in a multi-site software development organization. We also measure site interdependence, differences in same-site and cross-site communication patterns, and analyze the relationship of these variables to delay. Our results show a significant relationship between delay in cross-site work and the degree to which remote colleagues are perceived to help out when workloads are heavy. This result is particularly troubling in light of the finding that workers generally believed they were as helpful to their remote colleagues as to their local colleagues.
