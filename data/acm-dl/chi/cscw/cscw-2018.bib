abstract = {This talk considers three different forms of poker: 'live poker,' in which people play against each other; online poker, in which people play against each other via a highly mediated, software intensive interface; and video poker, in which there is no other person in the equation-just a machine. The main focus is on the case of online poker, which offers an opportunity to explore the nexus of social interaction and digital media. How do data-tracking, algorithmic strategy recommendations based on rapidfire computation of odds, and automated response features reconfigure the social experience of poker? How do players themselves reflect on the possibilities and limitations of a digital interface for the game? The talk will conclude with reflections on the broader trend toward the digitzation of traditional forms of gambling-not only online but within bricks-and-mortar settings (as in the turn from green-felt card games to screen-based "e-tables"). What are the economic and social stakes of this trend, both within the United States and in gambling markets abroad?},

Although searching could be helpful for solving arguments, building common ground, and reinforcing mutual assumptions, it can also cause interactional problems. Proactive search approaches can enrich conversations with additional information without neglecting the shared and established social norms of being attentive to ongoing interaction. This demo showcases SearchBot, a tool that minimizes the issues associated with the practice of searching during conversations. It accomplishes this by tracking conversational background speech and then providing continuous recommendations of related documents and entities in a non-intrusive way [3].},

Twitter users can take advantage of third-party websites to get more detailed metrics about the health of another users account, or they can make reports to Twitter after experiencing abuse, but neither option easily allows them to avoid abusive users. We present Tweety Holmes, which analyzes the word usage of Twitter profiles, detects potentially abusive behavior and then warns users visually. It follows principles of algorithmic transparency by visually indicating which words or tweets flagged the profile as abusive so users can better understand the context and also alerts users when they are mentioned or messages by a potentially abusive user with the hopes that this early warning can prevent unhealthy interactions from taking place in the future.},

Researchers often need to train themselves on the mapping of the control interface to the robots possible degrees-of-freedom, which can be confusing and time consuming. In this demo we present our remote puppeteering WoZ interface whereby a replica of the robot is able to remotely control a fully functional robot nearby. We are presenting this system using our robot Pingu, an open source social robot designed for Human-Robot Interaction labs.},

Most existing crowdsourcing platforms do not provide full-fledged process management, which affects the productivity of developing crowdsourcing applications and may also lead to low quality potentially. Although some tools have been designed for addressing the problem, most of them mainly target specific scenarios and are inflexible to be ex-tended. To overcome those limitations, we present Service4Crowd, a highly flexible and extensible process management platform for crowdsourcing that provides a one-stop solution for requesters based on service-oriented architecture. In Service4Crowd, a crowdsourcing process is implemented as a composite service, in which a component service represents an activity. We will demonstrate how these features facilitate the development, deployment and execution of a crowdsourcing application.},

abstract = {Throughout the 2010s interest in both organic user interfaces and various tangible haptics systems has grown steadily. Prior art has shown this through transmitting shape as a means of a novel interaction. Oobleck is a mixture of water and cornstarch that exhibits properties of both a solid and liquid depending on whether or not force is applied to it at the time. Prior art mainly employed the use of sound and vibration to activate the oobleck. The results were somewhat effective but really lacked any precise control over the oobleck. However, by embedding magnetic particles and some chemical additives in the oobleck, finer and more dynamic control over the oobleck could be attained. A magnetic matrix was concepted as a user interface to test the oobleck medium. As a proof of concept, 4 solenoid valves with small neodymium attached to them were used. Neodymium were used instead of electro-magnets due to their extremely dense and strong magnetic fields. The interface was designed to communicate fingertip touch between parties. 4 touch sensors were placed on a mouse shaped interface, when triggered, these would deactivate relays that controlled solenoids with small neodymium attached to them, springing upwards to be near a thin receptacle holding the oobleck. A user could then feel the shape of the oobleck change in specific locations to reflect the feeling of the person pressing their fingertips against the sensor area.},

abstract = {Data has become a core asset for organizations. However, the data infrastructures, which makes data accessible often require IT expertise, which consequently places high demands on organiza-tions' computational knowledge and skills. This paper reports on preliminary results of an action research intervention that questions how data can become an accessible enabler for service innovation in small and medium-sized organiza-tions (SMEs). On this basis, I highlight three in-frastructuring challenges for data infrastructures that are relevant from a Participatory Design (PD) perspective. The paper concludes by suggesting future work and advice sought.},

To test their theories, end users design structurally-sound experiments, improve them via community reviews, and run them with other participants. Controlled experiments show that participants create better hypotheses and experimental designs when they have access to procedural training.

Guiding questions include: What is lost when we rely exclusively on click-based data? How can researchers better measure and account for "invisible" interactions such as exchanges that are triggered by social media, but occur in other channels? What principles are important to bear in mind as we attempt to capture, document, and understand contemporary social media practices?},

Drawing on activity theory, we develop an understanding of current SAR sensemaking and planning activities, which help explore unforeseen factors that are relevant to the design of training systems.

We report an exploratory qualitative analysis of 20 participants' reactions to these mechanisms when applied to the context of political speeches. Our analysis suggests that Danmaku is more engaging but forces splitting of attention between comments and content of the speeches. In addition, Danmaku may encourage users to leave more playful comments whereas appended comments may foster more serious reflection on the political content of a video.},

abstract = {Prison officials often experience challenges with coordinating prisoner welfare and support because it demands not only time but several responsibilities. From field study conducted we discovered that there is the need for efficient communication amongst the record officers, welfare officers and higher prison authorities that require information for both short/long term decision making. The large network of prison authorities makes it difficult to stay informed and organized. Consequently, errors in sentence computation and award of remission as well as the breakdown communication may result to reduced quality of support to prisoners. Therefore, we explored the possibilities of aiding the coordination of prisoner welfare and support through mobile collaborative technologies i.e. an online platform accessible from any smart device. In the light of identified design opportunities, we suggest SentCompute - a prison sentence/bail computation platform consisting of interactive tools for supporting activities of prison officials and prisoner's loved ones.},

This paper investigates the effect of cognitive styles on performance of dyads engaged in collaborative gaming activities. 24 individuals took part in a mixed methods user-study; they were classified as field dependent (FD) or independent (FI) based on a cognitive style elicitation instrument. Three groups of teams were formed, based on the cognitive style of each team member: FD-FD, FD-FI, FI-FI. We examined performance in terms of game completion time, cognitive load, and player experience. The analysis revealed that FD-FI cognitive style had an effect on the performance and the mental load. We expect the findings to provide useful insight for practitioners and researchers on improving team collaboration in different contexts, such as learning, eSports, and disaster response.},

Preliminary results suggest that gig workers working in the high quality of platforms are more likely to have greater job autonomy and satisfaction.

Hence, finding out the factors that lead to successful fundraising and predicting the probability of success for a project has been one of the most important challenges in the crowdfunding. This work is the first attempt to use in-band project content - text - data only, contained in all the Campaign, Updates, and Comments sections of a crowdfunding project (not in combination with any other out-of-band project metadata or statistically-derived numeric features), for success prediction. By adopting (i) the sequence to sequence (seq2seq) deep neural network model with sentence-level attention and (ii) Hierarchical Attention-based Network (HAN) model, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in predicting success of campaigns, as much as 89-91%. We also show that our method achieves 76% accuracy on average on the very first day of project launch, using campaign main text data only.},

First, it adopts a Collective Action perspective to analyze how hate groups identify problems in the social groups they target, suggest solutions to the problems, and motivate their supporters. Then, the codebook highlights strategies of influence through the lens of Propaganda Devices. We validate our codebook by applying it to a sample of 250 publicly available tweets sent by 15 Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate groups. The codebook fosters future research by outlining the dimensions of framing in hate group communications, thus laying theoretical grounds for curating datasets and building computational models of hateful language.},

This is particularly critical in social media where the flood of information makes it difficult for people to assess the veracity of the false stories from such deceitful sources. Therefore, people oftentimes fail to look skeptically at these stories. We explore a way to circumvent this problem by nudging users into making conscious assessments of what online contents are credible. For this purpose, we developed FeedReflect, a browser extension. The extension nudges users to pay more attention and uses reflective questions to engage in news credibility assessment on Twitter. We recruited a small number of university students to use this tool on Twitter. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the study suggests the extension helped people accurately assess the credibility of news. This implies FeedReflect can be used for the broader audience to improve online news literacy.},

We focus on qualitative data collected during the print shop's first year of operation. We provide insight into some of the challenges faced by youth employees while configuring Slack on their devices, and some of the ways that youth needed to adapt into being proactive and responsive in the workspace. These early findings suggest that despite being digital natives with prior experience communicating online, transitioning to Slack was not an entirely natural process. These findings will be used to inform a deeper investigation into the usage of Slack by youth working in technical jobs.},

abstract = {Surveys show that teleworkers tend to feel isolated due to the lack of informal communication. To solve this problem, we propose a telepresence robot system that triggers informal communication. Drawing on Kendon's finding of greeting structure prior to interaction, we propose a system that presents two salutations, distance salutation and close salutation. Our experiment with a prototype system suggests that the proposed method is effective in inducing informal communication over the distance.},

abstract = {Online social activism ('slacktivism') carries low barriers to entry and is generally considered to be low risk and low impact for participants. However, recent social and political activism shows 'hashtag activism' is effective in mobilizing offline action, but also in raising awareness and ensuring social movements remain within the public discourse through the use of viral Twitter hashtags. In an examination of three recent viral hashtags associated with ongoing social movements: #metoo, #takeaknee, and #blacklivesmatter, I find that users not only use hashtags to aggregate discussion, but also use them in tweets alone to express solidarity and victimhood. Users participating in activist spaces actively work to integrate social movement hashtags into their tweets, enabling the hashtag to function on multiple levels, both to their personal followers as well as to the initial tweet. With social media research pushing toward large-scale data sets, this level of nuance is easily lost. I find hashtags are being used alone serves as a means of communicating user solidarity and personal stories, and suggest criticism of how they are used by scholars and journalists falls short of the mark.},

Mechanisms of control have been widely studied in traditional organizations; however, work in the gig economy differs from traditional organizations in that the role of a human supervisor or manager is replaced with digital systems. Thus, there is reason to suspect that our traditional theories of control may not hold for new forms of work in the gig economy. To address these concerns, this study examines how gig economy workers', specifically Uber drivers, perceive behavioral control and its effect on their job satisfaction. Our results suggest that emotional labor mediates the relationship between behavioral control and job satisfaction.},

In this way, Airbnb intensifies and extends the working day by enrolling local Cubans into the work of emotional labor.},

We believe that a tool-based approach to SGLAs can minimize instructor burden while still facilitating SGLA and associated student benefits. We designed the SmartGroup system, an instructional intervention which aims at being minimally burdensome to instructors. The system relies upon generalized, modular components and two novel features, group reshuffling and a grade appeals process conducted by student appeal graders. We believe this tool-based approach can effectively lead to the management of scale-free SGLAs, as it reduces reliance on instructors and increases self and peer learning opportunities. We plan to conduct empirical studies of the SmartGroup system, further research the theoretical space surrounding SGLAs, and further develop paradigm cases for various categories of SGLAs.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 international students and found that the information seeking behaviors involved deliberate processes of decision making depending on participants' purposes, correspondent information sources, and attributes the sources hold, such as experience, relational closeness, etc. The results shed light on the future design of CSCW systems for supporting information seeking among sojourners.},

We coded these responses to examine how agent type influenced the nature of the stressor disclosed, and the intimacy and amount of disclosure. Participants discussed fewer homelife related stressors, but more finance-related stressors and more chronic stressors overall with the personified chatbot than the other two agents. The personified chatbot was also twice as likely as the other agents to receive disclosures that contained very little detail. We discuss the role played by personification and interactivity in interactions with conversational agents, and implications for design.},

The project was dependent on community ties and the social capital contained in them. However, in large modern cities, neighborhoods are no longer home to densely connected people, and most neighborhoods have a large floating population (eg., people who are there only for work.) While working on this project, we observed that seniors tend to create their own routines and their own personal networks, which could be leveraged for support.

GitHub's direct push method was used to coordinate both loosely- and tightly-coupled work, with the latter requiring collaborators to follow socially-accepted conventions. The pull-based method was adopted once the project was released to the public. While face-to-face and online meetings were prominent in the early phases, GitHub's issues became instrumental for communication and project management in later phases. Our findings have implications for the design of collaborative writing tools.},

abstract = {Increasingly, citizen scientists do work beyond the primary goal of the project (i.e., advanced work) such as writing articles. These activities often take place in discussion boards and have a set of linguistic norms for contributing. For newcomers, learning this language presents a challenge since there are no formal opportunities for them to learn the language and volunteers who join later need to learn more than volunteers who join earlier in a project life-cycle. In this poster, we examine how newcomers language use shifts over the course of two citizen science projects. We find that, although, newcomers joining later might face obstacles, newcomer language associated with advanced work increase over the project's life-cycle. The analysis can help the science team assess whether newcomers on the talk page have either adopted advanced terminologies or they need to have a more formal resource such as tutorial or blog posts.},

Our study used the text from Kiva which enables prosocial lending to small business and community groups located in emerging markets. Given that funders do exhibit prosocial motivations, we draw on the identifiable victim effect theory which postulates identifiability of a victim leads to greater charitable giving. We then develop nuanced linguistic features to operationalize the identifiable victim effect and test if operationalization has an impact on funding.},

Women and LGBTQIA people are vulnerable targets if their privacy is violated, leading to situations that can compromise their safety both online and off. In an initial exploration of privacy and safety concerns of participants in online fan communities, we find that they avoid engaging online to preserve their privacy and safety, thus limiting the involvement of already marginalized voices in public discourse. LGBTQIA people in particular practice non-use for fear of being outed in personal spaces if recognized. In response to challenges users face, we recommend that developers consider finer controls over user content in addition to thoughtful practices among researchers and journalists when it comes to sharing "public" data.},

We found polarizing responses with individuals either calling for the end of the law or those opposing its end on religious or moral grounds. This analysis provides a basis for building a model to automatically code tweets to increase the accuracy of Arabic text prediction.

In this work we investigate the relationship between media type and student collaboration and attribution patterns during collaborative content creation. We run similarity analyses on text and video artifacts submitted by students as part of collaborative exercises in an undergraduate module. Our main finding is that the same cohort of students was significantly more likely to attribute non-original content to its sources when authoring text compared to video content and when this content is not produced by a peer student. Our preliminary results based on only two media suggest that media type has a considerable impact on student collaborative behavior. We conclude that media type must be taken into consideration when designing collaborative learning exercises and addressing issues of academic integrity and copyright infringements.},

abstract = {Digital products and services are commonplace in our personal lives where software and its algorithms provide assistance and amenities. However, interactive systems within industrial settings have yet to catch up with consumer products, especially with regard to the quality of interaction and user experience. With the rise of automation and data exchange on massive scales, the role of human work is challenged and the importance of cooperation emphasized. New concepts of smart factories in which machines and software are doing parts of the work tasks emerge, drastically altering the nature of work in industrial settings from manual labor to increasingly complex tasks. HCI and especially CSCW offer concepts, technical tools and methods to cope with this disruptive shift towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Networked assistive systems, for instance, are capable of individually addressing and satisfying the diverse needs of a heterogeneous workforce. We propose this workshop to discuss new perspectives on HCI and CSCW in industrial contexts with regard to the emerging IIoT. The goal of the workshop is to explore the design space of IIoT applications, its implications on cooperative work and to formulate new research opportunities to current challenges.},

abstract = {Our full day-workshop focuses on challenges encountered by researchers attempting to design and conduct studies that span 2 or more social computing platforms, such as parallel sites for different language populations, different platforms, or different user experience designs. Social computing researchers are increasingly interested in these studies that examine user behavior across different sites. For example, researchers have conducted multi-sited studies to understand user behavior across culture, language, and media. In such studies, researchers are challenged to develop and execute methodologies that allow them to navigate frameworks that enable comparisons among multiple sites. Researchers face challenges adapting their methodologies to handle diverse populations, regulations, large datasets and more. The goal of this workshop is to come to a common understanding of what multi-site research is and how we can continue to expand and incentivize this form of research within the CSCW community.},

abstract = {With the wide adoption of information infrastructures in healthcare (IIH), citizens and healthcare professionals now carry out intensive "data work' as part of their healthcare and self-management practices. For example, citizens use mobile apps to track personal health data for both formal and informal usages, clinicians rely on electronic health records (EHR) to document patient information, and hospital administrators use EHRs to generate data to monitor quality and efficiency of healthcare services. The creation, accumulation, management, and communication of data is increasingly central to patient work, clinical work, and management and governance of healthcare providers. To better understand data work in healthcare, this workshop aims to convene researchers from different disciplines to discuss data work performed among the entire ecosystem of clinical care delivery from patients to clinicians to administrators. Critical topics include but are not limited to: patient data work (both voluntary and compelled by clinicians as part of treatment); algorithmic authority of information infrastructure and effects on the exercise of expertise and discretion of healthcare professions; clinician demands for documentation (and balancing these demands with patient-centered care); new forms of healthcare data work, including new occupations and tasks; and data-driven accountability and management in healthcare.},

abstract = {Voice interfaces such as in-home and mobile digital assistants, mobile screen readers, and chatbots are tools that can support communication, collaboration, and information seeking, and are becoming increasingly commonplace. Because they don't require the motor skills needed for text input through a keyboard, the barriers of entry and use for older adults and people with disabilities are lowered. Yet, accessibility of speech interaction can still be a challenge. Using and designing voice interfaces is radically different from graphical interfaces, redefining how we must think about accessibility and what it means for a conversation to be accessible. This workshop invites submissions from researchers whose work advances the study of, design, and use of voice-based interfaces by older adults and people with disabilities. At the workshop, we will 1) explore recent advances in accessibility and voice interface research, 2) situate voice-based accessibility in prior work and existing theoretical frameworks, 3) discuss open challenges in the design of voice-based systems, and 4) identify opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration to continue research in this field.},

Recent advances in technology open a range of opportunities for designing new and innovative collaborative mixed reality games, but also raise questions around design, technical requirements, immersion, safety, and player experience. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers, designers, practitioners, and players to identify the most pressing challenges that need to be addressed in the next decade, discuss opportunities to overcome these challenges, and highlight lessons learned from past designs of such games. Participants will present their ideas, assemble and discuss a collection of related papers, outline a unifying research agenda, and engage in an outdoor game ideation and prototyping session. We anticipate that the CSCW community can contribute to designing the next generation of collaborative mixed reality games and technologies and to support the growth of research and development in this exciting and emerging area.},

abstract = {An abundance of digital tools exist for tracking various aspects of one's life, body, health, and activities. These personal informatics (PI) and quantified self (QS) technologies are designed to help users capture, reflect on, and get actionable feedback about personal information. In the past (and still in many cases), the design of such systems emphasized an individual-centric vantage point that focused on supporting an individual's self-tracking, self-knowledge, and self-management activities. Over time, however, a growing number of researchers are recognizing that such practices are socially motivated, collaboratively conducted, and embedded in interpersonal contexts, in ways that extend well beyond single-user use cases and requirements. This is resulting in the appearance of a host of new theories, methods, and frameworks for considering social contexts and practices within PI literature and design spaces. This one-day workshop will bring together researchers interested in better understanding and designing for PI at its intersection with social computing. Activities will provide participants with opportunities to share insights, exchange approaches, foster collaborations, and strengthen our connections.},

With researchers focused on global development, social justice, accessibility, and more, we contend that there are issues of equity and inclusion impacting the research subjects located on the "margins" of digital existence, the research that examines these issues, and the researchers engaged in this research. The goal of our workshop is to brainstorm and discuss how we might demarginalize those researched, this research, and these researchers within CSCW scholarship. For this, we build on the concepts of intersectionality and solidarity from feminist scholarship, aiming to recognize the differences and similarities across disparate contexts and to uncover synergistic research trajectories and objectives. Our workshop will be led by academic and industry researchers pursuing CSCW, Social Computing, and Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD) research focused on intersectionality, equity, and inclusion. We invite a broad range of participants from research and practice interested in learning about or deepening their understanding of these topics.
