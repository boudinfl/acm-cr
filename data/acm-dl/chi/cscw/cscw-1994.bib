abstract = {This field experiment investigates individual, structural and social influences on the use of two video telephone systems. One system flourished, while an equivalent system died. We use a time series design and multiple data sources to test media richness theory, critical mass theory, and social influence theories about new media use. Results show that the fit between tasks and features of the communications medium influences use to a degree, but cannot explain why only one system survived. Critical mass—the numbers of people one can reach on a system—and social influence—the norms that grow up around a new medium—can explain this phenomenon.},

abstract = {The Montage prototype provides lightweight audio-video glances among distributed collaborators and integrates other applications for coordinating future contact. We studied a distributed group across three conditions: before installing Montage, with Montage, and after removing Montage. We collected quantitative measures of usage as well as video-tape and user perception data. We found that the group used Montage glances for short, lightweight interactions that were like face-to-face conversations in many respects. Yet like the phone, Montage offered convenient access to other people without leaving the office. Most glances revealed that the person was not available, so it was important to integrate other tools for coordinating future interaction. Montage did not appear to displace  the use of e-mail, voice-mail, or scheduled meetings.},

Based on experimental results, the following were determined to be the system requirements to support spatial workspace collaboration: independency of a field of view, predictability, confidence in transmission and sympathy toward the system. Additionally, a newly developed camera system, the GestureCam System, is introduced. A camera is mounted on an actuator with three degrees of freedom. It is controlled by master-slave method or by a touch-sensitive CRT. Also, a laser pointer is mounted to assist with remote pointing. Preliminary experiments were conducted and the results are described herein.},

Starting with standard off-the-shelf software, the tailors adapt that software to the particular workplace in which they are embedded, at the same time that they modify and extend the practices of that workplace. Over time, their adaptations and the tailoring processes themselves become structured and systematized within the organization. This tendency toward systematization is in part a response to the requirement that the results of tailoring be sharable across groups of users. Our study focuses on several dimensions of the work of tailoring: construction, organizational change, learning, and politics. We draw two kinds of lessons for system development: how  better to support the work of tailors, and how system developers can learn from and cooperate with tailors.},

We argue that well-managed mediation may be a useful mechanism for shaping technologies to evolving contexts of use, and that it extends our understanding of the powerful role that intervenors can play in helping CSCW applications succeed.},

The design of CSCW systems for real-world application must move beyond the bounds of organizational forms conceived of in terms of “common ownership.”},

abstract = {Workflow management is a technology that is considered strategically important by many businesses, and its market growth shows no signs of abating. It is, however, often viewed with skepticism by the research community, conjuring up visions of oppressed workers performing rigidly-defined tasks on an assembly line. Although the potential for abuse no doubt exists, workflow management can instead be used to help individuals manage their work and to provide a clear context for performing that work. A key challenge in the realization of this ideal is the reconciliation of workflow process models and software with the rich variety of activities and behaviors that comprise “real” work. Our experiences with the InConcert workflow management system are used as a basis for  outlining several issues that will need to be addressed in meeting this challenge. This is intended as an invitation to CSCW researchers to influence this important technology in a constructive manner by drawing on research and experience.},

abstract = {The correct and timely creation of systems for coordination of group work depends on the ability to express, analyze, and experiment with protocols for managing multiple work threads. We present an evolution of the Trellis model that provides a formal basis for prototyping the coordination structure of a collaboration system. In Trellis, group interaction protocols are represented separately from the interface processes that use them for coordination. Protocols are interpreted (rather than compiled into applications) so group interactions can be changed as a collaborative task progresses. Changes can be made either by a person editing the protocol specification “on the fly” or by a silent “observation” process that participates in an application solely to  perform behavioral adaptations.Trellis uniquely mixes hypermedia browsing with collaboration support. We term this combination a hyperprogram, and we say that a hyperprogram integrates the description of a collaborative task with the information required for that task. As illustration, we describe a protocol for a moderated meeting and show a Trellis prototype conference tool controlled by this protocol.},

This paper suggests a simple synchronous collaboration paradigm in which the sharing of the views of user/application interactions occurs at the window level within a multi-user, multi-window application. The paradigm is incorporated in a toolkit, DistView, that allows some of the application windows to be shared at a fine-level of granularity, while still allowing other application windows to be private. The toolkit is intended for supporting synchronous collaboration over wide-area networks. To keep bandwidth requirements and interactive response time low in such networks, DistView uses an object-level replication scheme, in which the  applicaton and interface objects that need to be shared among users are replicated. We discuss the design of DistView and present our preliminary experience with a prototype version of the system.},

abstract = {The need to merge different versions of an object to a common state arises in collaborative computing due to several reasons including optimistic concurrency control, asynchronous coupling, and absence of access control. We have developed a flexible object merging framework that allows definition of the merge policy based on the particular application and the context of the collaborative activity. It performs automatic, semi-automatic, and interactive merges, supports semantics-determined merges, operates on objects with arbitrary structure and semantics, and allows fine-grained specification of merge policies. It is based on an existing collaborative applications framework and consists of a merge matrix, which defines merge functions and their parameters and allows definition of  multiple merge policies, and a merge algorithm, which performs the merge based on the results computed by the merge functions. In conjunction with our framework we introduce a set of merge policies for several useful kinds of merges we have identified. This paper motivates the need for a general approach to merging, identifies some important merging issues, surveys previous research in merging, identifies a list of merge requirements, describes our merging framework and illustrates it with examples, and evaluates the framework with respect to the requirements and other research efforts in merging objects.},

Despite high user satisfaction with the system and interface, and extensive user feedback and analysis, many users experienced difficulties in signing on and use, ranging from simple lack of resources to complex organizational and intellectual trade-offs. Using Bateson's levels of learning, we characterize these as levels of infrastructural complexity which challenge both users and developers. Usage problems may result from different perceptions of this complexity in different organizational contexts.},

abstract = {The pattern of CSCW system users helping other using to resolve problems and make more effective use of such tools has been observed in a variety of settings, but little is known about how help patterns develop or their effects. Results from a pre-post study of the implementation of CSCW tools among university faculty, staff and administration indicate that the network of helping relationships is largely disaggregated and generally follows work group alignments rather than technical specialization. A relatively small group of “high providers” is responsible for most help to users, and tends to act as a liaison between central support staff and work group members. These providers are not systematically different from other personnel except in terms of their expertise.  Implications of these findings for the development and cultivation of help relationships in support of CSCW are developed.},

abstract = {Ethnographic studies of CSCW have often seemed to involve the investigation of relatively large-scale and highly specific systems, consequently ignoring the small office within which many people spend much of their working lives and which is a major site for the introduction and implementation of IT. This paper is concerned with a “quick and dirty” ethnographic study of a small office that was considering the introduction of greater levels of IT. Generic features of office work are outlined: the process of work in a small office and its recurrent features, notably the massive volume of paperwork; the importance of local knowledge in the accomplishment of work; and the phenomenon of “constant interruption.” This paper suggests that despite the obvious  contrasts with work settings analysed in other ethnographic studies, similar features of cooperative work can be observed in the small office. It further suggests that the issues of cooperation and the sociality of work cannot be ignored even in small-scale system design.},

In this particular case, the network ran into a number of difficulties, was resisted by its potential users for a variety of reasons, was faced with being withdrawn from service on a number of occasions and (at the time of writing) remains only partly used. The study points to the kinds of problems that a project to introduce computer support for cooperative work to an actual organization is likely to face and a series of concepts are offered to help manage the complexity of these problems. In so doing, this paper adds to and extends previous studies of CSCW tools in action but also  argues that experience from the field should be used to re-organise the research agenda of CSCW.},

abstract = {Computer-mediated small group research has focused efforts on the medium of electronically networked text-based messages. An experiment which instead combines a synchronous text-based messaging medium with two-dimensional interactive computer graphics is detailed. Three-person groups participated in a risk-taking choice-dilemma task involving a discussion of the dilemma and consensus attainment. The groups' prediscussion and postdiscussion opinions were collected. Two conditions, one where groups received graphics-based feedback of their individual prediscussion opinions, and a second, which included a graphical representation of the prediscussion average, were coupled with a text-based communication medium. The text-based medium, without interactive graphics, served as control. In  the condition involving the graphical prediscussion opinions and average, groups sent proportionately more messages containing persuasive-style arguments and proportionately fewer messages containing normative-style arguments. In the graphical condition without the average, roughly the inverse was found to occur. In the control, the discussion parameters fell proportionately between the two graphics conditions. In both graphics conditions, the first discussant to advocate a decision proposal had a stronger influence on the group decision than in the control. The data suggests that the inclusion of two-dimensional graphics can either augment or inhibit normative and informational forms of social influence during the group decision-making process.},

In order to accurately model CSCW communication patterns, an ADP-group is a related set of cooperating processes whose communication is supported by allowing a spectrum of quality-of-service, message delivery reliability, atomicity and causal ordering options to co-exist within the same group. ADP-group communication provides appropriate connection management support and network control within distributed CSCW environments characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of equipment types, network performance and user activity levels. This efficiency is achieved by defining a small set of canonical group communication operations, by automatically making  appropriate connections between data sources and sinks, and by using a receiver-based method of connection specification, monitoring and modification.},

Use of 1) reliable (multicast) transport of absolute, rather than relative, information sets, 2) time stamps, and 3) a last-in-wins policy provide coherency often lacking in replicated architectures.

Forum was most successful in enabling effective presentations in cases when the topic sparked a great deal of audience participation or when the purpose of the talk was  mostly informational and did not require a great deal of interaction.
