abstract = {Urbanization has created transient, ethnically-varied, and densely-populated communities where meaningful human contact is difficult. Urban social norms such as "civil inattention" --- a deliberate display of unwillingness to become more familiar with strangers --- discourage social interactions among strangers. While these norms help reduce anxiety or fear in overcrowded urban centers they hinder meaningful social interactions in public spaces (coffee shops, museums, and malls, etc.) and events (conferences, galas, etc.) where such interactions should occur. This paper describes CommonTies, a simple technological nudge that managers of interaction spaces and organizers of social events can use to leverage contextual information to encourage social interactions among strangers.},

Being played in a real-world scenario as well as augmented reality scenario, the game can be used to study the different perception of presence.},

Our motivation, therefore, is to develop a process which assists groups of academics and other stakeholders to collaboratively generate research strategy in an open, engaging, and democratic way. To this end, we will discuss a simple process involving two tools (both free for use by academics) which are designed to avoid, or at least alleviate, what we term as Academic Animal Farm.},

abstract = {Industries are increasingly encouraging human-robot collaboration to complete tasks. As robots become more ubiquitous in these environments, robots will need an appropriate understanding of the social behaviors necessary to work alongside humans. The goal of my dissertation is to inspect how key behaviors for effective collaboration--particularly communication strategies, gestures, and object management--affect task outcomes. An understanding of these behaviors will inform designs of collaborative robot behavior and reveal a deeper understanding of human behavior. My work first understands a set of human behaviors, translates those behaviors to a robot, and tests the impact of each behavior on collaborative outcomes.},

Local-scale volunteer monitoring programs face a particular tension: the need to demonstrate the quality of the data they collect, while having limited resources available to provision and sustain ICT for data management and provenance tracking. As both a practitioner and an ethnographer, I am exploring ways to resolve this tension by documenting the challenges I observe and by proposing design recommendations where appropriate. My research to date is exemplified in "wq", which is both a set of design principles and a modular software framework I have built to address these challenges.},

We predict the success rate of 2,344 ideas for 12 different design challenges in a collaborative Web-based innovation platform based on their cited sources' conceptual distance from the target domain (measured using probabilistic topic modeling of the ideas). Surprisingly, we find that innovators who cite conceptually near sources of inspiration achieve a higher success rate than those who prefer far sources.

October Sky is a voluntary lecture series for youth in the segregated situation in Korea. It stemmed from three lines of Twitter messages, and became an annual event by hundreds of volunteers. In parallel with October Sky, two art exhibitions reflect new ways of community making as well as boost the spirit of open participation. The artworks illustrates how the loosely-networked community who shared the social faith could organize themselves and co-work together relied on ad-hoc social media communication.},

We present a qualitative study on the experiences of people who offer to rent out their homes, or parts of them, via the online peer-to-peer renting service Airbnb. Our study suggests that the frame monetary transactions set to exchange relationships contributes to the hosts' sense of control and ease in the exchange. We identified two behavioral patterns that highlight the importance of reputation and trust: (1) hosts divert their accumulated reputational capital into the rental price and (2) they may price their property below "the market price", so that they can choose their exchange partners form a wider pool of candidates.},

To design CORPUS, we conducted contextual inquiries with 10 scholars in philosophy to collect user requirements and generate design ideas. An interactive prototype was developed based on the user requirements. Finally, we conducted a formal evaluation study with the same 10 scholars to test the usability of CORPUS.},

abstract = {Values Levers are defined as design "practices that open new conversations about social values and encourage consensus around those values as design criteria [5]." One values lever that is often unnoticed is that of white nationalist appropriation. White Nationalists are often "othered" as extremists which obfuscates rhetoric around racism. In return, levers about race are only pulled during the design process if it is overt in its racial sensitivity. We often refer to this as political correctness or more appropriately "racism without racists [1]." This research represents one case study of the unintended white nationalist appropriation of content within The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. By building on a discussion originated by white nationalists, we hope to pull a values lever that approaches multi-cultural and multi-national content that doesn't focus on racism as an extremist activity but an unintended consequence of well-intended design.},

In this research, we classify distance settings into four categories. Then, we perform semi-structured interviews with 20 couples in various distance settings. The analysis allows us to develop design guidelines for mitigating conflicts associated with the four distance categories.},

In this proposal, we motivate the problem of grammatical error correction and outline the challenges of ensuring quality in a setting where traditional methods of aggregation (e.g. majority vote) fail to produce the desired results. We then propose a design for quality control and present preliminary results indicating the potential of crowd workers to provide a scalable solution.},

For practical reasons, researchers have to rely mainly on self-reporting techniques with all their shortcomings. We propose combining qualitative interviews and a privacy-friendly tracking software to capture users' actions in OSN. We provide first results on how collected tracking data in combination with individualized interviews allow deeper insights into user practices, can prevent problems of self-reporting, and may eventually support software design.},

However, surprisingly, social feedback has no significant advantage over progress logging. Further, participants who gave and received social feedback had a higher level of annoyance toward the study.

We propose here a system to find the stress network around an individual that contributes to her stress status. Furthermore, we also present a strategy for coping by exploiting this stress network. We argue that our proposed design can benefit individuals by making them more stress-resilient over time by exploiting their social bonds.},

We can then utilize these ideas to find solutions to emerging problems involving the massive use of social media. For example, Twitter can be used as a positive tool for the prevention of bad habits among teens.},

abstract = {Often when people search the web from their phones, they do so collaboratively. We present a mobile application that supports in-person collaborative search by allowing users to physically signal a willingness to share. While the core application provides standard mobile search functionality, users rotate their devices to landscape orientation to indicate (to the device and others) they are entering a collaborative mode. We study two uses of collaborative mode, one where users rate results to create a group list, and another where screens and actions are shared across devices.},

The field experiment is designed as a between-subject experiment with four conditions of the apps' default settings, in the context of installing a third-party application that creates a birthday calendar on Facebook. Our preliminary findings suggest that default privacy settings that are context-relevant may help users make better informed privacy decisions, increase their likelihood of engaging with an app, and improve their privacy perceptions of the app.},

However, little is known about SBE scientists' distributed collaboration, a vital practice that CI must support for the doing of science. To provide insight into this question we interviewed 12 scientists regarding their work practices as they pursue joint research projects with colleagues from other universities. We identify the most frequently used physical and digital tools for SBE science and collaboration and characterize commonplace scientific practices in this domain with a paradigmatic example.},

People's perceptions of reality will develop through their social networks and everyone will perceive that the information their social network produces reflects reality, but at the macro level, we will see an ever-diverging cacophony of socially constructed realities.},

Those features are important for developers to coordinate their work (Dabbish et al., 2012; Marlow et al., 2013). We hypothesized that the social system of GitHub users was bound by system interactions such that contributing to similar code repositories would lead to users following one another on GitHub or vice versa. Using a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) correlation, however, only a weak correlation among followship and production activities (code, issue, and wiki contributions) was found. Survey with GitHub users revealed an ecosystem on the Internet for software developers, which includes many platforms, such as Forrst, Twitter, and Hacker News, among others. Developers make social introductions and other interactions on these platforms and engage with one anther on GitHub. Due to these preliminary findings, we describe GitHub as a part of a larger ecosystem of developer interactions.},

Inspired by concepts such as collective intelligence, citizen science, citizen journalism and crowdsourcing, diverse types of organisations are aiming to increase engagement with the public, collect localised knowledge, or leverage human cognition and creativity. In supporting these approaches, organisations are often provoked to make their data and processes more open, and to be inclusive of differing motivations and perspectives from inside and outside the organisation. In doing so, they raise new questions for both designers and organisations. For example how are "official" and "unofficial" information sources combined or hosted, mediated, or considered reliable? Does the role of the professional change through greater involvement of amateurs? How are the motivations of members of the public harnessed for mutual benefit? This workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to address those questions from different perspectives.},

abstract = {Understanding how collaborative systems are used across countries and cultures is increasingly important to the success of these systems and to the CSCW research community. Studies aiming to examine cross-cultural phenomena, however, must overcome a number of methodological issues that are unique to research in this context. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers with an active interest in cross-cultural studies in CSCW, discuss methodological challenges, and arrive at a common understanding of methodological approaches that can be the basis of best practice in our research community. Through presentations on specific methodological problems, such as access to diverse populations, study design, and data analysis, we expect in depth discussions around each of these challenges and, ultimately, to improve the quality of and support the growth of cross-cultural research in the CSCW community.},

abstract = {Open, online learning environments, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and open learning communities have been promoted as a way to expand equitable access to quality education. Such learning experiences are potentially enriched via extensive networks of peer learners. Even though challenges exist to realize these aspirations, open, online learning environments can serve as a mechanism for how we provide transformative learning experiences. This workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to explore how the body of CSCW knowledge can better support the vision of sustaining peer-to-peer learning in online environments. Integrating contributions from designers, researchers, and practitioners at the intersection of CSCW &amp; education, participants will co-create future visions and proposed implementations for open, online learning environments.},

abstract = {Interest in collaborative editing (CE) has seen a dramatic rise in recent years. The ubiquity of cloud services, crowdsourcing, and mobile devices means that today's Internet citizens are increasingly accustomed to producing and editing data in a shared network environment. While systems such as Google Drive, Microsoft Web Apps, Apache Wave and Codoxware allow users to collaboratively edit shared information, they have just begun to scratch the surface of CE's full potential. In the coming years, users will expect to be able to collaboratively create, share, and edit documents and data in a dynamic, real-time, and intuitive manor. This workshop aims to connect researchers, developers, and users to help explore the future of CE in tomorrow's information landscape. This year's workshop focuses on how researchers and industry practitioners can work together to accelerate delivery of CE capabilities to meet the needs of the typical information-age user.},

abstract = {When developing new ICT systems and applications for domestic environments, rich qualitative approaches improve the understanding of the user's integral usage of technology in their daily routines and thereby inform design. This knowledge will often be reached through in-home studies, strong relationships with the users and their involvement in the design and evaluation process. However, whilst this kind of research offers valuable context insights and brings out unexpected findings, it also presents methodological, technical and organizational challenges for the study design and its underlying cooperation processes. In particular, due to heterogeneous users in households in terms of technology affinity, individual needs, age distribution, gender, social constellations, personal role assignment, project expectations, etc. it produces particular demands to collaborate with users in the design process and thereby exposes a range of practical challenges. The full-day workshop wishes to identify these practical challenges, discuss best practice and develop a roadmap for sustainable relationships for design with users.},

abstract = {Past and current research studies recurrently acknowledge the relevance of technological developments to support informal caregivers with their activities and responsibilities. These studies highlight the demands associated with caregiving and suggest that further research in the area is needed to better understand such demands and to figure out more effective ways for technologies to support people who deal with them. In Europe, especial attention has been dedicated to informal caregivers for the past few years, due to indicators showing that more than 80% of the care for frail and old people, one of the major groups of care receivers in the region, is informally provided by family members and friends. The same scenario can be found across different continents, corroborating the relevance of the subject. Therefore, this workshop seeks contributions exploring issues of collaboration and coordination in the context of informal care. Early stage research studies in the area as well as contributions exploring the design and evaluation of computer technologies for it are most welcome.},

abstract = {There seems to be a need for more rapid, lower cost, exploratory, lightweight, responsive and revisable methods that can help with discovery based research in CSCW. A growing number of researchers are expressing frustration with the challenge of selecting or developing an appropriate research method, applying it in a CSCW context and then having to justify the legitimacy of that method in publications, and particularly through the peer review process. In this workshop we will share experiences in the design adaptation and use of lightweight research methods. We will explore ways to assess the validity, strengths, and weaknesses of these methods - and how to explain these and justify them to others.},

abstract = {This one-day workshop aims to stimulate research on the sharing and reuse of scientific resources in cooperative scientific work. As science trends toward increasing geographic and temporal scales, larger collaborations, and greater interdisciplinarity, scientific resources increasingly need to be more mobile and integrated with computer supported information and communication environments. Sharing, reuse and circulation of resources become a central challenge and critical component of cooperative scientific work. We interpret sharing broadly to include circulating scientific materials in any way that makes them available to other scientists. We include a variety of resources such as data, software, materials and specimens, workflows, technical know-how, clinical and laboratory protocols, and algorithms. We explore a range of sharing and reuse practices past and present, what motivates and limits them, how sharing can be done more effectively, what tools and techniques facilitate or constrain it, and how this relates to systems and science policy.},
