abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the concept of dynamically changing between centralized, replicated, and hybrid collaboration architectures. It is implemented by providing users a function that dynamically changes the mapping between user-interface and program components. We decompose the function into more primitive commands that are executed autonomously by individual users. These commands require a mechanism to dynamically replicate user-interface and program components on a user's site. We present a logging approach for implementing the mechanism that records input (output) messages sent to one incarnation of a program (user-interface) component, and replays the recorded messages to a different incarnation of the component. Preliminary experiments with an implementation of the mechanism show that response and completion times can improve by dynamically changing the architecture to adapt to changes to the set of users in a collaboration session involving a mix of mobile and stationary devices.},

abstract = {Consistency control is critical for the correct functioning of distributed collaboration support systems. A large number of consistency control methods have appeared in the literature with different design tradeoffs and usability implications. However, there has been relatively little work on how to accommodate different protocols and variations in one framework to address the dynamic needs of collaboration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for supporting adaptable consistency protocols in collaborative systems. Our approach cleanly separates data and control, allowing consistency protocols to be dynamically attached to shared data at the object level. Protocols can be switched at run time without modifying source code.},

abstract = {Academic conferences provide a social space for people to present their work, learn about others' work, and interact informally with one another. However, opportunities for interaction are unevenly distributed among the attendees. We seek to extend these opportunities by allowing attendees to easily reveal something about their background and interests in different settings through the use of <i>proactive displays</i>: computer displays coupled with sensors that can sense and respond to the people nearby. We designed, implemented and deployed a suite of proactive display applications at a recent academic conference: <i>AutoSpeakerID</i> augmented formal conference paper sessions; <i>Ticket2Talk</i> augmented informal coffee breaks. A mixture of qualitative observation and survey response data are used to frame the impacts of these applications from both individual and group perspectives, highlighting the creation of new opportunities for both interaction and distraction. We end with a discussion of how these social space augmentations relate to the concepts of focus and nimbus as well as the problem of shared interaction models.},

Findings show that the system was used extensively by the students in a variety of ways, including sharing of photos, video clips, and websites, and for facilitating social interaction. We discuss how the interactive shared surface was appropriated by the students and introduced into their everyday lives in ways that both mirrored and extended their existing practices within the communal space.},

What role do each of these new tools bring to the campaign/election process? How effective have they proven in this election cycle? What is their utility outside the scope of the presidential election cycle? Are they merely "teaser" tools to get people in the door or do they have the potential to facilitate lasting political change in all political arenas large and small? In addition, electronic voting is a current open research area. What do systems need to take into account to assure voters' confidence that their votes are being collected and tallied correctly and securely? What information needs to be presented to the voter at the time of polling to ensure the most effective voting systems available? What do we know at this point and where are the future research areas that need scrutiny? Each panelist will present their current research related to this area and comment on the ways in which their findings add to the current body of knowledge. Particular attention will be paid to articulating research streams that currently need to be addressed and positing methods to address these open research questions.},

abstract = {Information hiding is one of the most important and influential principles in software engineering. It prescribes that software modules hide implementation details from other modules in order to decrease the dependency between them. This separation also decreases the dependency among software developers implementing modules, thus simplifying some aspects of collaboration. A common instantiation of this principle is in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs). We performed a field study of the use of APIs and observed that they served many roles. We observed that APIs were successful indeed in supporting collaboration by serving as contracts among stakeholders as well as by reifying organizational boundaries. However, the separation that they accomplished also hindered other forms of collaboration, particularly among members of different teams. Therefore, we think argue that API's do not only have beneficial purposes. Based on our results, we discuss implications for collaborative software development tools.},

abstract = {Open-source software development projects are almost always collaborative and distributed. Despite the difficulties imposed by distance, these projects have managed to produce large, complex, and successful systems. However, there is still little known about how open-source teams manage their collaboration. In this paper we look at one aspect of this issue: how distributed developers maintain group awareness. We interviewed developers, read project communication, and looked at project artifacts from three successful open source projects. We found that distributed developers do need to maintain awareness of one another, and that they maintain both a general awareness of the entire team and more detailed knowledge of people that they plan to work with. Although there are several sources of information, this awareness is maintained primarily through text-based communication (mailing lists and chat systems). These textual channels have several characteristics that help to support the maintenance of awareness, as long as developers are committed to reading the lists and to making their project communication public.},

To address this situation, we have developed a tool, named Hipikat, that provides developers with efficient and effective access to the group memory for a software development project that is implicitly formed by all of the artifacts produced during the development. This <i>project memory</i> is built automatically with little or no change to existing work practices. We report an exploratory case study evaluating whether software developers who are new to a project can benefit from the artifacts that Hipikat recommends from the project memory. To assess the appropriateness of the recommendations, we investigated when and how developers queried the project memory, how the evaluated the recommended artifacts, and the process by which they utilized the artifacts. We found that newcomers did use the recommendations and their final solutions exploited the recommended artifacts, although most of the Hipikat queries came in the early stages of a change task. We describe the case study, present qualitative observations, and suggest implications of using project memory as a learning aid for project newcomers.},

abstract = {This paper reports from a study of Norwegian medical emergency call (AMK) centres, in which advanced radio and telephone communication technologies are handled by a team of nurses and ambulance personnel to coordinate medical emergency resources (ambulances, doctors, helicopters, and so on). The AMK centres have made use of a range of technologies since they were established 15-20 years ago. During the last 5 years, several of the centres have implemented an information system, AMIS to integrate several functions that before were handled by using separate specialised systems. By observation in seven medical emergency call centres and a survey covering 38 of 43 such centres in Norway in the period 1996-2002, this study focuses on collaboration and use of communication technologies in a teamwork setting. It is found that important aspects of the AMK centre teamwork include <i>redundancy of communication, competence and technologies</i>, as well as a well-developed <i>overall attention</i> from the operators. These aspects support a transparent <i>social integration</i> of technologies in use. The use of integrated systems, such as the AMIS, may challenge this transparency, by which one operator may follow the other operator's actions. It is concluded that serious care must be taken to introduce larger information systems, so that basic principles, which have emerged during the teamwork practice to secure high service reliability, are maintained.},

abstract = {Electronic mail has become the most widely-used application for business productivity and communication, yet many people are frustrated with their email. Though email usage has changed, our email clients largely have not. In this paper, we describe a prototype email client developed out of a multi-year iterative design process aimed at providing those who "live in their email" with an improved, integrated email experience. We highlight innovative features and describe the user trials for each version of the prototype with resulting modifications. Finally, we discuss how these studies have recast our understanding of the email "habitat" and user needs.},

abstract = {Single-user interactive computer applications are pervasive in our daily lives and work. Leveraging single-user applications for multi-user collaboration has the potential to significantly increase the availability and improve the usability of collaborative applications. In this paper, we report an innovative <i>transparent adaptation</i> approach for this purpose. The basic idea is to adapt the single-user application programming interface to the data and operational models of the underlying collaboration supporting technique, namely Operational Transformation. Distinctive features of this approach include: (1) <i>Application transparency</i>: it does not require access to the source code of the single-user application; (2) <i>Unconstrained collaboration</i>: it supports concurrent and free interaction and collaboration among multiple users; and (3) <i>Reusable collaborative software components</i>: collaborative software components developed with this approach can be reused in adapting a wide range of single-user applications. This approach has been applied to transparently convert MS Word into a real-time collaborative word processor, called CoWord, which supports multiple users to view and edit any objects in the same Word document at the same time over the Internet. The generality of this approach has been tested by re-applying it to convert MS PowerPoint into CoPowerPoint.},

abstract = {Although telepointers are valuable for supporting real-time collaboration, they are rarely seen in commercial groupware applications that run on the Internet. One reason for their absence is that current telepointer implementations perform poorly on real-world networks with varying traffic, congestion, and loss. In this paper, we report on a new implementation of telepointers (HPT) that is designed to provide smooth, timely, and accurate telepointers in real-world groupware: on busy networks, on cable and dialup connections, and on wireless channels. HPT maintains performance at usable levels with a combination of techniques from multimedia and distributed systems research, including UDP transport, message compression, motion prediction, adaptive rate control, and adaptive forward error correction. Although these techniques have been seen before, they have never been combined and tailored to the specific requirements of telepointers. Tests of the new implementation show that HPT provides good performance in a number of network situations where other implementations do not work at all - we can provide usable telepointers even over a lossy 28K modem connection. HPT sets a new standard for telepointers, and allows designers to greatly improve the support that groupware provides for real-time interaction over distance.},

Previous research has indicated that awareness displays showing the workload of a target can reduce the harm interruptions inflict, but can increase the cognitive load on interrupters. This paper describes an experiment testing whether team membership influences interrupters' motivation to use awareness displays and whether the informational-intensity of a display influences its utility and cost. Results indicate interrupters use awareness displays to time communication only when they and their partners are rewarded as a team and that this timing improves the target's performance on a continuous attention task. Eye-tracking data shows that monitoring an information-rich display imposes a substantial attentional cost on the interrupters, and that an abstract display provides similar benefit with less distraction.},

To help orient users and guide them to areas of interest within flash forums, we designed ForumReader, a tool combining data visualization with automatic topic extraction. We describe lessons learned from deployment to thousands of users in a real world setting. We also report a laboratory experiment to investigate how interface components affect behavior, comprehension, and information retrieval. The ForumReader interface is well-liked by users, and our results suggest it can lead to new navigation patterns. We also find that, while both visualization and text analytics are helpful individually, combining them may be counterproductive.},

abstract = {Single Display Groupware (SDG) lets multiple co-located people, each with their own input device, interact simultaneously over a single communal display. While SDG is beneficial, there is risk of <i>interference</i>: when two people are interacting in close proximity, one person can raise an interface component (such as a menu, dialog box, or movable palette) over another person's working area, thus obscuring and hindering the other's actions. Consequently, researchers have developed special purpose interaction components to mitigate interference techniques. Yet is interference common in practice? If not, then SDG versions of conventional interface components could prove more suitable. We hypothesize that collaborators spatially separate their activities to the extent that they partition their workspace into distinct areas when working on particular tasks, thus reducing the potential for interference. We tested this hypothesis by observing co-located people performing a set of collaborative drawing exercises in an SDG workspace, where we paid particular attention to the locations of their simultaneous interactions. We saw that spatial separation and partitioning occurred consistently and naturally across all participants, rarely requiring any verbal negotiation. Particular divisions of the space varied, influenced by seating position and task semantics. These results suggest that people naturally avoid interfering with one another by spatially separating their actions. This has design implications for SDG interaction techniques, especially in how conventional widgets can be adapted to an SDG setting.},

Our findings shed light on (1) how work strategies are affected by group size, (2) how social interaction varies with respect to table size, and (3) how the speed of task performance is influenced by group size but not by table size. In addition, our experiments revealed that for larger groups, designers might need to add additional vertical displays for shared information. This finding opens the door for extending single-display groupware to shared-display groupware settings that involve multiple, shared displays.},

abstract = {Researchers seeking alternatives to traditional desktop computers have begun exploring the potential collaborative benefits of digital tabletop displays. However, there are still many open issues related to the design of collaborative tabletop interfaces, such as whether these systems should automatically orient workspace items or enforce ownership of workspace content. Understanding the natural interaction practices that people use during tabletop collaboration with traditional media (e.g., pen and paper) can help to address these issues. Interfaces that are modeled on these practices will have the additional advantage of supporting the interaction skills people have developed over years of collaborating at traditional tables. To gain a deeper understanding of these interaction practices we conducted two observational studies of traditional tabletop collaboration in both casual and formal settings. Our results reveal that collaborators use three types of tabletop territories to help coordinate their interactions within the shared tabletop workspace: <i>personal, group</i>, and <i>storage</i> territories. Findings from a spatial analysis of collaborators' tabletop interactions reveal important properties of these tabletop territories. In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the role of tabletop territoriality in collaboration, we conclude with a synthesis of our findings and previous research findings and with several relevant design implications.},

Significant progress has been made in understanding the diffusion of collaborative tools in the workplace. We read stories about the extraordinary success of some communities, and about the harsh failure of others. This paper argues that lessons learnt from these stories should be analyzed using the theoretical foundations of Diffusion of Innovations theories, and systematized to create a set of guidelines for community creators to make their efforts more efficient. We begin by presenting a theoretical background for analyzing technology diffusion. We then analyze the stories of diffusion of ReachOut - a tool for peer support and community building developed in our Research Lab - in two different communities, using this theory. Finally, we propose a framework for planning for successful diffusion of collaborative tools, using our experiences with ReachOut.},

abstract = {This paper considers the complexity of measuring the return on investment for technology adoption. A brief case study of technology adoption in a large design and construction firm provides a clear view of factors that came into play. The technology considered is simple; the apparent costs and benefits are relatively clear. Four parties are involved: diverse employees interested in using dual monitors, the information technology support group in the organization, an executive who had worked his way up from drafting, and employees of a software company that is considering expanding their support for dual monitor use. In the construction company, a seemingly logical and inexpensive hardware upgrade was subject to a wide range of technical and social pressures, some obstructing and others promoting adoption. Decisions are made in a manner that did not fit the model held by the product planners and designers in the software company.},

In particular, many recent online games feature persistent collaborative virtual environments (CVEs), with complex social organisation and strong social bonds between players. This paper presents a study of <i>'There'</i>, one such game, focusing on how <i>There</i> has been appropriated by its players. In particular we describe how its flexibility has allowed players to develop their own forms of play within the game. Three aspects of <i>There</i> are discussed: first, how the environment supports a range of social activities around objects. Second, how the chat environment is used to produce overlapping chat and how the game itself provides topics for conversation. Lastly, how the 'place' of <i>There</i> is a fluid interaction space that supports safe interactions between strangers. The paper concludes by drawing design lessons concerning the importance of supporting shared online activity, interaction between strangers, and the difficulties of designing for play.},

In this paper, we analyze player-to-player interactions in two locations in the game Star Wars Galaxies.

To move beyond this, a fundamental challenge for photoware consists of developing support for the practical achievement of sharing 'at a distance'. Specifically, this entails augmenting the natural production of accounts or 'photo-talk' to support the distributed achievement of sharing.},

abstract = {Scientific collaboration is largely focused on the sharing and joint analysis of scientific data and results. Today, a movement is afoot within the scientific computing community to shift "collaboratory" development from traditional tool-centric approaches to more data-centric ones. Yet, to effectively support data sharing means more than providing a common repository for storing and retrieving shared data sets. In order to reasonably comprehend and apply another researcher's data set, the scientist must grasp the various contexts of the data as it relates to the overall data space, applications, experiments, projects, and the scientific community. Under development at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the Biological Sciences Collaboratory (BSC) enables the sharing of biological data and analyses through diverse capabilities such as metadata capture, electronic laboratory notebooks, data organization views, data provenance tracking, analysis notes, task management, and scientific workflow management. Overall, BSC strives to identify and capture the various social and scientific contexts in which data sharing collaborations in biology take place and to provide collaboration tools and capabilities that can effectively support and facilitate these important data sharing contexts.},

Word processors have much richer data types and more comprehensive operations than plain text editors. Among others, the capability of updating attributes of any types of object is an essential feature of all word processors. In this paper, we report an extension of OT for supporting a generic <i>Update</i> operation, in addition to <i>Insert</i> and <i>Delete</i> operations, for collaborative word processing. We focus on technical issues and solutions involved in transforming <i>Updates</i> for both consistency maintenance and group undo. A novel technique, called Multi-Version Single-Display (MVSD), has been devised to resolve conflict between concurrent <i>Updates</i>, and integrated into the framework of OT. This work has been motivated by and conducted in the CoWord project, which aims to convert MS Word into a real-time collaborative word processor without changing its source code. This OT extension is relevant not only to word processors but also to a range of interactive applications that can be modelled as editors.},

In this paper we present a novel algorithm based on operation serialisation for consistency maintenance in collaborative graphical editing dealing not only with simple operations such as create, delete, move, change colour or position, but also with group/ungroup operations. Based on the classification of conflicts into real and resolvable, an undo/redo mechanism is used in order to re-execute the operations in an imposed serialisation order.},

While the former has been partly solved, the latter has never been addressed in any published work. We propose a novel approach to solving both problems in the same framework. Particularly it preserves the effects relation of concurrent operations so that convergence is achieved automatically. Our work provides a new perspective into group editors and operational transformation algorithms.},

abstract = {"Shadow Communication" system has been developed allowing others to communicate by means of their "shadows" in remote space. This is designed so that each participant's shadow enters into a space through a semi-transparent screen and interacts with another subject's shadow. This interaction occurs at a common 'stage' (a co-existing space) that can be self-organized. The interaction takes place in a spatial relationship (<i>"ma"</i>- perceptive distance or <i>"Maai"</i> in Japanese) and generates a situation where, seemingly, the participants are actually talking to each other in a face-to-face manner. Experiments on collaborative drawings or remote lecturing conducted with various subjects resulted in the different groups being properly positioned in their co-existing space, thus suggesting that the co-creative activities between the groups were successfully established.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigated systems for supporting remote collaboration using mobile robots as communication media. It is argued that the use of a remote-controlled robot as a device to support communication involves two distinct ecologies: an ecology at the remote (instructor's) site and an ecology at the operator's (robot) site. In designing a robot as a viable communication medium, it is essential to consider how these ecologies can be mediated and supported. In this paper, we propose design guidelines to overcome the problems inherent in dual ecologies, and describe the development of a robot named GestureMan-3 based on these guidelines. Our experiments with GestureMan-3 showed that the system supports sequential aspects of the organization of communication.},

Pairs performed a referential communication task with and without a shared visual space. A detailed sequential analysis of the communicative content reveals that pairs with a shared workspace were less likely to explicitly verify their actions with speech. Rather, they relied on visual information to provide the necessary communicative and coordinative cues.},

In this paper, we begin to explore factors in the home that might be useful for signaling availability to close friends and family. In particular, we use the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to measure subjects' current activities and self-reported availability to interruption. Based on follow-up interviews, we develop a number of hypotheses that we test through a hierarchical linear regression analysis. Results indicate that individual differences, certain home locations, and leisure activities play an important role in determining patterns of availability. This study has implications for the development of CSCW systems with automatic sensing of activity to deal with interruption and activity recognition both inside and out of the home.},

The technology and its design draws from a broad range of field studies, including research in classrooms and museums. These delineate the requirements and considerations that inform solutions to enhancing paper whilst preserving its integrity. The paper also discusses a naturalistic experiment, an evaluation in a museum, where we assessed the technology and the solution. We also chart the progressive development of this solution and the ways in which seemingly simple actions and issues became reconstituted as highly complex technical and analytic problems.},

From these insights and from other sources in the literature, we describe and illustrate a number of concepts for integrated technologies and environments that can support collocated collaborative work specifically in the context of design work. These concepts are intended as an exercise in divergent design thinking that owes to carefully constructed insights based on observations.},

We conducted a qualitative study in a setting where participants are loosely connected, physically separated, and work together over a period of 4-9 months to author a complex technical document-a clinical trial protocol. Our study differs from most prior work in that the collaboration is longer-lived, and that the collaborators do not share equivalent status, background, nor domains of expertise. Our data demonstrates that the participants do <b>not</b> share the same view or representation of the authoring process, even though it has a long organizational history. Nonetheless, the participants can still coordinate their activity while maintaining only partially consistent representations of what they are doing. We contend that partial consistency in the participants' concept of the collaborative process is a feature for their asynchronous collaboration at a distance. Based on our findings we suggest a number of improvements for both tools and tool usage that have direct impact on support for collaborative authoring.},

Examination of these changes shows high volatility in the composition of the CSCW research community over decade-long time spans.

An emergent communication network of engineering students that took place in a distributed distance learning environment was examined. Three measures of an actor's social network, density, brokerage, and reach, and participants' locus of control, internal vs. external, were assessed. The data suggest that, relative to participants with external locus of control, participants with internal locus of control decreased their network density over time but increased their brokerage and reach. The results are discussed in the context of instrumental action, through which participants are assumed to develop personal networks in pursuit of maximizing potential social capital.},

abstract = {Most research applying Social Network Analysis (SNA) to online learning has been focused on understanding the social network of the class as an entity. This work, on the other hand, explores student specific analysis (i.e. analyzing each student individually). This student-centered analysis uses a graphical metaphor to provide the instructor an intuitive understanding of the student's interactions within the class. The paper presents a prototype of the visual metaphor and reports on a pilot study of the application of the prototype to students within a web-based course.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an evaluation method that provides the capability of comparing results of like-structured evaluations that occur over time and with changing toolsets or environmental conditions. This makes use of the framework ideal for comparison of collaboration tools. The framework helps to structure evaluations by mapping system goals to evaluation objectives, metrics, and measures. The upper-most levels of the framework are conceptual in nature, while the bottom level is implementation-specific, i.e., evaluation-specific. Careful attention during construction of the conceptual elements for an evaluation template allows for its reuse in a series of like-structured evaluations and comparison of those results.},

abstract = {As new communications media foster international collaborations, we would be remiss in overlooking cultural differences when assessing them. In this study, 24 pairs in three cultural groupings--American-American (AA), Chinese-Chinese (CC) and American-Chinese (AC) --worked on two decision-making tasks, one face-to-face and the other via IM. Drawing upon prior research, we predicted differences in conversational efficiency, conversational content, interaction quality, persuasion, and performance. The quantitative results combined with conversation analysis suggest that the groups viewed the task differently--AA pairs as an exercise in situation-specific compromise; CC as consensus-reaching. Cultural differences were reduced but not eliminated in the IM condition.},

abstract = {During face-to-face interactions, groups frequently overly rely on the dominant viewpoint to lead the group in its decision-making process. We begin with a discussion of this phenomenon and the possibility for technology to assist in addressing it. We then present findings from a behavioral study that examines how a shared display of individual speaker-participation rates can impact the behavior of the group during a collaboration task. The results from the study indicate that the presence of such a display influences the behavior of group participants in the extremes of over and under participation. While influencing the quantity of time someone speaks is not directly equivalent to influencing the topics discussed, we suggest that this approach of providing peripheral displays of social information is promising for improving certain types of group interactions.},
