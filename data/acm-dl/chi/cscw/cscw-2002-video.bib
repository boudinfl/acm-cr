abstract = {Recent advances have made it easy to amass large collections of digital recordings of our daily lives. The Personal Digital Historian Project (PDH) is an ongoing effort to help people organize and navigate digital collections in order to reflect on and share their experiences. The PDH interface employs a table-top display containing a circular interface, which allows people to interact with each other as well as their data. We have developed a group history of our own research lab as the first application of PDH. This case study motivated several new extensions to PDH, including methods for branching off from and returning to various conversational threads, discovering relevant information, and incorporating background contexts to enable flexible story sharing. A primary finding of our user evaluation was that people were able to focus on and enjoy their conversation and the data, rather than concentrate on operating the PDH system.},

abstract = {Instant messengers have become a popular medium for providing awareness of others and supporting casual interaction. To smoothly move into and out of interaction, it is necessary to afford an awareness of who is around and if they are available. We have developed a peripheral visualization for an instant messenger designed to utilize people's natural cognitive abilities. Each contact is represented by pictures for each availability state (e.g. online, offline) or video snapshots embedded within a 3D environment using a space metaphor. Contacts that are more available--determined as a function of availability state and a viewer-settable interest level--are placed in the foreground and contacts less available are placed closer to a single vanishing point in distant space. The viewer is able to move contacts throughout the space to create a spatial mapping. Contacts that are of interest display conversation bubbles containing incoming messages.},
