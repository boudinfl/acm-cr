abstract = {Over the last years there has been a growing consensus that new generation interfaces turn their focus on the human element by enriching an Affective dimension. Affective generation of autonomous agent behaviour aspires to give computer interfaces emotional states that relate and take into account user as well as system environment considerations. Internally, through computational models of artificial hearts (emotion and personality), and externally through believable multi-modal expression augmented with quasi-human characteristics. Computational models of affect are addressing problems of how agents arrive at a given affective state. Much of this work is targeting the entertainment environment and generally does not address the requirements of multi-agent systems, where behaviour is dynamically changing based on agent goals as well as the shared data and knowledge. This paper discusses one of the requirements for real-time realisation of Personal Service Assistant interface characters.We describe an approach to enabling the computational perception required for the automated generation of affective behaviour in multi-agent real-time environments. This uses a current agent communication language so as they not only convey the semantic content of knowledge exchange but also they can communicate affective attitudes about the shared knowledge.},

The concise descriptions that occur in citations are similar to the short queries people typically form when searching; therefore, citations make a better basis for indexing than do the words used within a research article itself. Using this indexing technique we are able to provide a user interface that presents users with an automatically generated directory of the information space surrounding a query. Our objective with this interface is to present people with the information for which they have asked as well as the information for which they may have intended to ask.},

In this paper, we argue that embodiment can serve an even stronger function if system designers use actual human conversational protocols in the design of the interface. Communicative behaviors such as salutations and farewells, conversational turn-taking with interruptions, and referring to objects using pointing gestures are examples of protocols that all native speakers of a language already know how to perform and that can thus be leveraged in an intelligent interface. We discuss how these protocols are integrated into Rea, an embodied, multi-modal conversational interface agent who acts as a real-estate salesperson, and we show why embodiment is required for their successful implementation.},

The visualization also allows browsing the history and selectively undoing/redoing events within a scenario or across scenarios. It uses the AI formalism of contexts to maintain multiple, possibly mutually inconsistent, knowledge base states.

abstract = {Computers can be very helpful to us by performing tasks on our behalf. For example, they are very good at performing calculations, storing information and producing visualisations of objects that do not yet exist as a made artifact. Increasingly, however, a different role is being found for the computer. It is the role of a catalyst, or a stimulant, to our own creative thinking. In such cases the computer is not primarily performing a task for us and generating an answer within itself, rather it is helping us to generate answers within ourselves. The computer helps us think creatively. This role for the computer can be illustrated in the context of computer support to creative design. In order to design computer systems that support the creative process, it is important to understand that process well enough to predict what might help, rather than hinder. Given such research, we may begin to define the characteristics of what the computer must do in order to augment creative thinking. The paper explores a particular application of intelligent user interfaces:- the augmentation of creative thought in artists.},

In particular, CACTUS uses declarative hierarchical task-models to derive guidance instructions. Additionally, CACTUS releases tutorial course designers from part of the intensive workload of developing tutor programs as these guidance components are currently developed.

abstract = {For intelligent interfaces attempting to learn a user's interests, the cost of obtaining labeled training instances is prohibitive because the user must directly label each training instance, and few users are willing to do so. We present an approach that circumvents the need for human-labeled pages. Instead, we learn “surrogate” tasks where the desired output is easily measured, such as the number of hyperlinks clicked on a page or the amount of scrolling performed. Our assumption is that these outputs will highly correlate with the user's interests. In other words, by unobtrusively “observing” the user's behavior we are able to learn functions of value. For example, an intelligent browser could silently observe the user's browsing behavior during the day, then use these training examples to learn such functions and gather, during the middle of the night, pages that are likely to be of interest to the user. Previous work has focused on learning a user profile by passively observing the hyperlinks clicked on and those passed over. We extend this approach by measuring user mouse and scrolling activity in addition to user browsing activity. We present empirical results that demonstrate our agent can accurately predict some easily measured aspects of one's use of his or her browser.},

abstract = {The ability to deliver appropriate information to learners at the most appropriate time is an essential component of good instruction. In the best learning environments, this information is received in the context of the performance of the skills that are being acquired. This paper explores a technological approach to situated information retrieval by linking materials to segments of a video recording a skill performance. An interface is described where users navigate through a video performance and are presented with information relevant to the current video location. An approach to algorithmically generating interfaces of this type is then presented. The system takes as input annotations that describe a video recording of a performance, translates these annotations into subject terms used to catalog information resources, and then retrieves materials from online database servers using the Z39.50 information retrieval protocol. As an example application, the system was used to generate online teacher professional development materials by linking annotated video of classroom teaching with resources cataloged in the ERIC database.},

abstract = {Information processed by computers is frequently stored and organized for the computer's, rather than for the user's, convenience. For example, information stored in a database is normalized and indexed so computers can efficiently access, process, and retrieve it. However, it is not natural for people to manipulate such formal/prescriptive representations. Instead, people frequently sort items by rough notions of association or categorization. One natural organizational process has been found to center around manipulations of objects in spatial arrangements. Examples of this range from the organization of documents and other items on a regular office desktop to the use of 3″\texttimes{}5″ cards to organize a conference program. Using visual cues and spatial proximity, people change the categorizations of and relationships between objects. Without the help of indices or perfect memory people can still interpret, locate, and manipulate the information represented by the items and the higher-level visual structures they form. The VITE system presented here is an intuitive interface for people to manipulate information in their own way and at their own pace. VITE provides for configurable visualizations of structured data sets so users can design their own “perspectives” and a direct manipulation interface allowing editing of and manipulation on the structured data.},

This is commonly done by a sound engineer in a recording studio, live concert setting, or in setting up audio systems. The system uses inductive learning to acquire expert skill using nearest neighbor pattern recognition. This skill is then used in a sound equalization expert system, which learns to proficiently adjust the timbres (tonal qualities) of brightness, darkness, and smoothness in a context-dependent fashion. The computer is used as a tool to sense, process, and act in helping the user perform a perceptual task. Adjusting timbres of sound is complicated by the fact that there are non-linear relationships between equalization adjustments and perceived sound quality changes. The developed system shows that the nearest-neighbor context-dependent equalization is rated 68% higher than the set linear average equalization and that it is preferred 81% of the time.},

However, present speech recognizers and natural language interpreters cannot yet process spontaneous speech accurately. These limitations make it necessary to impose constraints on users' speech inputs. Thus, ergonomic studies are needed to provide user interface designers with efficient guidelines for the definition of usable speech constraints.We evolved a method for designing oral and multimodal (speech + 2D gestures) command languages, which could be interpreted reliably by present systems, and easy to learn through human-computer interaction (HCI). The empirical study presented here contributes to assessing the usability of such artificial languages in a realistic software environment. Analyses of the multimodal protocols collected indicate that all subjects were able to assimilate rapidly the given expression constraints, mainly while executing simple interactive tasks; in addition, these constraints, which had no noticeable effect on the subjects' activities, had a limited influence on their use of modalities.These results contribute to the validation of the method we propose for the design of tractable and usable multimodal command languages.},

The system incorporates a series of novel text analysis procedures that automatically computes (1) a set of social networks detailing who is responding to and/or citing whom in the newsgroup; (2) a set of “discussion themes” that are frequently used in the newsgroup archive; and, (3) a set of semantic networks that represent the main terms under discussion and some of their relationships to one another. The text analysis procedures are written in the Perl programming language. Their results are recorded as HTML, and the HTML is displayed with a Java applet. With the Java-based graphical interface one can browse a set of Usenet newsgroup articles according to who is “talking” to whom, what they are “talking” about, and the central terms and possible emergent metaphors of the conversation. In this paper it is argued that the Conversation Map system is just one example of a new kind of content-based browser that will combine the analysis powers of computational linguistics with a graphical interface to allow network documents and messages to be viewed in ways not possible with today's, existing, format-based browsers which do not analyze the contents of the documents or messages.},

abstract = {In recent years, many systems and approaches for recommending information, products or other objects have been developed. In these systems, often machine learning methods that need training input to acquire a user interest profile are used. Such methods typically need positive and negative evidence of the user's interests. To obtain both kinds of evidence, many systems make users rate relevant objects explicitly. Others merely observe the user's behavior, which fairly obviously yields positive evidence; in order to be able to apply the standard learning methods, these systems mostly use heuristics that attempt to find also negative evidence in observed behavior.In this paper, we present several approaches to learning interest profiles from positive evidence only, as it is contained in observed user behavior. Thus, both the problem of interrupting the user for ratings and the problem of somewhat artificially determining negative evidence are avoided.The learning approaches were developed and tested in the context of the Web-based ELFI information system. It is in real use by more than 1000 people. We give a brief sketch of ELFI and describe the experiments we made based on ELFI usage logs to evaluate the different proposed methods.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for learning user's interests in the Web-based personalized information filtering system called WAIR. The proposed method analyzes user's reactions to the presented documents and learns from them the profiles for the individual users. Reinforcement learning is used to adapt the term weights in the user profile so that user's preferences are best represented. In contrast to conventional relevance feedback methods which require explicit user feedbacks, our approach learns user preferences implicitly from direct observations of user behaviors during interaction. Field tests have been made which involved 7 users reading a total of 7,700 HTML documents during 4 weeks. The proposed method showed superior performance in personalized information filtering compared to the existing relevance feedback methods.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet has resulted in enormous amounts of information that has become more difficult to access efficiently. Internet users require tools to help manage this vast quantity of information. The primary goal of this research is to create an efficient and effective tool that is able to summarize large documents quickly. This research presents a linear time algorithm for calculating lexical chains which is a method of capturing the “aboutness” of a document. This method is compared to previous, less efficient methods of lexical chain extraction. We also provide alternative methods for extracting and scoring lexical chains. We show that our method provides similar results to previous research, but is substantially more efficient. This efficiency is necessary in Internet search applications where many large documents may need to be summarized at once, and where the response time to the end user is extremely important.},

abstract = {Computer gaming offers a unique test-bed and market for advanced concepts in computer science, such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), intelligent agents, graphics, and sensing technology. In addition, computer gaming is especially well-suited for explorations in the relatively young fields of wearable computing and augmented reality (AR). This paper presents a developing multi-player augmented reality game, patterned as a cross between a martial arts fighting game and an agent controller, as implemented using the Wearable Augmented Reality for Personal, Intelligent, and Networked Gaming (WARPING) system. Through interactions based on gesture, voice, and head movement input and audio and graphical output, the WARPING system demonstrates how computer vision techniques can be exploited for advanced, intelligent interfaces.},

abstract = {Recent research in the area of information retrieval hypothesizes that people benefit from social clues, so called social navigation, when they try to navigate information spaces [7]. We have designed an on-line grocery store building upon those ideas manifested in several different ways. The most central feature is that the system uses a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering as the basis for recipe recommendations. This filtering process can in turn be controlled by editors, whose role is to control the content of the “recipe clubs”. Other types of social clues are also present, such as displaying how many users that have chosen a recipe. Finally, the system shows information about other users currently present in the system, and allows users to get in direct contact through chat.},

Primary functions of this system are to easily generate help desk contents about software usage (They will be called as “procedure data”.). Then the system classifies procedure data and constructs procedure database. Also the system provides useful functions to refer accumulated procedure data.},

abstract = {We describe the capabilities of a knowledge-based system to automatically generate a collection of electronic notebooks containing various forms of online documentation and reports. This system is a subsystem of a larger knowledge-based system called SciNapse. SciNapse's raison d'etre is to transform high-level simulation problem specifications into executable numerical programs. The electronic notebooks are generated from the same domain knowledge bases that the system uses to perform its primary tasks. These online notebooks are of two different kinds: reference materials and reports. Reference materials are generated from the latest version of the knowledge base, which includes the classes that drive the system, and a network of objects representing meta-information about the system. The reference materials document the system's capabilities and help users understand what the system can do. Reports are generated from the instances created by a run of the system. They document the transformations the input specification underwent in becoming code, and are intended to help a user understand what the system has done.We have found that our approach to producing documents has both advantages and disadvantages when compared with more traditional approaches to documentation. The advantages are that we can minimize the manual effort that is involved in writing documentation about the system, while at the same time maximizing the accuracy of the documentation that is produced.The main disadvantage has been the lack of truly appropriate authoring tools built to work in our environment. When we began, we expected the task of creating such authoring tools to be much easier than it has turned out to be. Later in this paper, we explore some of the factors that have caused this to be the case.},
