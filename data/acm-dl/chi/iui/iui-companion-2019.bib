abstract = {In this work, we illustrate the design of an explainable recommendation framework that seeks to maximize exploration while maintaining recommendation relevance. We use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model the temporal evolution of users' preference for items. We define an objective metric for exploration and frame the overall optimization loss function to incorporate exploration as a regularizer. We report evaluations on state of the art Netflix and IMDb datasets, and highlight future research agenda for developing an interactive framework based on the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Advances in mobile computing power have opened possibilities for processing intensive optical recognition and machine learning applications. Despite the widespread availability of mobiles phones and digital resources, the education industry has made few updates to time-consuming grading techniques: many teachers continue to grade tests by hand or use outdated technology. Our goal is to produce a seamless, efficient, and accessible mobile experience to automate grading across multiple formats. We present a solution that allows teachers to take a photo and receive a visualized result after our deep learning application recognizes handwriting patterns, grades test answers, and identifies names and IDs. As a result, we contribute an improved computational tool for teachers to quickly create and grade exams across various formats.},

This study investigated how the coupling of emotional states detected from facial expressions can be used as indices. Forty participants engaged in a simple explanation task that required coordination; their facial expressions were recorded. We analyzed the learners' emotional recurrence and investigated its validity through comparisons with randomized variables of emotion. Furthermore, we investigated the extent to which variables can be used as indices to determine learning performance. Based on these results, we discuss how to further investigate the use of emotional recurrence to predict collaborative learning for future work.},

Changes to the appearances of learners (facial expression or posture such as closing eyes, looking away) obtained by a Web camera are often used to estimate engagement due to the ease of installing the camera. In this work, firstly we collected data in an actual e-learning scenario at a Japanese cram school and found that the appearances of each learner hardly changed. Secondly, we propose an engagement estimation method based on synchrony of head movements, which occur frequently when students take notes. An analysis of our method using collected data revealed an F-score of 0.79, which is higher than the methods based on changes of appearance. This result indicates that our method has possibility to be more effective for engagement estimation in actual learning scenarios.},

The paper proposes a spoken educational game, exploiting Machine Learning techniques, to help children with ASD to understand how to correctly identify and express emotions. The game focuses on four emotional states (happiness, sadness, anger and neutrality) and is divided in two levels with increasingly difficulty: the first step is to learn how to recognize and express feelings and in the second phase emotional skills by the user are examined and evaluated. The application integrates a multilingual emotion recognizer from the pitch of the voice.},

Applications with various kinds of physical interactions have been deployed to enhance the learning experiences in many engineering domains. However, even though computer science education (CSE) is one of zestful topics in the recent years, there are few studies focusing on the embodiment of CSE materials, by which the abstract and intangible concepts could be transformed into an intuitive affordance that utilizes sensorimotor experiences during the learning process. We propose an augmented embodiment mobile app designed for computational thinking (CT), specifically the debugging practices and abstraction concept, that makes use of gestures and augmented reality for learners to interact with the content. We examine the logic by the design framework for embodied learning and discuss potential extensions of multimodal analytics in such an application. Our preliminary user study in a middle school shows students' engagement in the application, however, it also reflected several design issues that need to be solved in the next iteration. The future plan of data analysis and experiments is also discussed.},

Point-of-interest (POI) plays an important role in these applications for its rich semantic behavior information. However, most studies only use user's proactive POI check-ins which are extremely sparse and just a part of user's semantic offline behavior.In this paper, we use POI category check-ins which are obtained by matching user's GPS data, and propose a framework based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model group mobility and recommend the POI category of user at the next step. The category level of POI can reflect the semantic meaning of user mobility, and also reduce the recommendation space. Experiment results show that the recommendation accuracy is 11.9% higher with the group semantic offline behavior.},

abstract = {Clicking selfies using mobile phones has become a trend in the past few years. It is documented that the thrill of clicking selfies at adventurous places has resulted in serious injuries and even death in some cases. To overcome this, we propose a system which can alert the user by detecting the level of danger in the background while capturing selfies. Our app is based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The prediction is performed as a 5 class classification problem with classes representing a different level of danger. Face detection and device orientation information are also used for robustness and lesser battery consumption.},

Then, we proposed features of working logs such as editing behavior after viewing a target document, which were used as an input to machine learning algorithms for the estimation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the features of working logs can be used to improve estimation of feed-back from users.},

abstract = {Musical relaxation is a common method to relieve personal stress. Particularly, nature sounds, instrumental music, voice (chanting), "easy listening" songs, etc. can be played for relaxation. Nevertheless, effectiveness of the sounds used for the relaxation is idiosyncratic, depending on personal taste. In our approach, computer-guided audition for spatial soundscapes is investigated, automatically exploring a polyphonic area while using biosignals as indicators of satisfaction. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) method to discover the sound relaxation "sweet spot" in a polyphonic soundscape. An avatar roams within a pantophonic space, surrounded by six independent audio channels, while a human subject, listening through the avatar's ears, is connected to an electroencephalographic (EEG) headset. Besides the position of the avatar, pitch, reverberation, and filters can also be changed to find the most relaxing virtual standpoint and parameters for the listener. Instead of changing position manually, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) in reinforcement learning is used. An RL agent adjusts parameters according to reward values calculated by change of relative theta band (4--8 Hz) power.},

Our system is composed of sensor nodes for localization, which sense and transmit the magnitude of the magnetic field to a host computer, and anchor nodes, which intermittently generate DC magnetic field with the functionality as sensor nodes. An advantage of our system is that the cover range and estimation accuracy can be enhanced instantly by adding anchor nodes since the added anchor node is also automatically localized. Also, the sensor node can be implemented in a mm-scale form factor with small power consumption thanks to the geomagnetic sensor, which enables us to attach the sensor nodes to various things. Object tracking could serve as a primary application of this system, such as virtual reality (VR), interactive educational experience and rehabilitation which can benefit the human computer interaction.},

We approximate the dancer's hand trajectories by quartic B-spline curves and extract the S-shaped curves using its inflection points.

abstract = {The paper describes a demonstration of a database tool that automates the construction of database applications. The Automated Relational Technology (ART) Studio generates an end-user database application to information managed by a relational database. The ART Studio has a "configure, not code" interface that does not require any programming whatsoever. It generates an interactive decision tree interface that enables endusers to pinpoint information managed by the database and to display this information in a window. The newly discovered Branching Data Model (BDM) enables the Studio to generate both of these components, the decision tree and its window, automatically. Program logic in the Studio generates models of relational data between two table attributes. Other program logic attaches one BDM to another to construct tree structures as a decision tree interface and to connect window fields to table attributes throughout the database. The Studio and the end-user systems that it generates represents a paradigm shift away from today's "Visual Query" database interface. The new approach introduces a "Visual Predicate Calculus" model that treats SQL expressions as templates consisting of reusable logical parts. The BDM led to the consideration of SQL expressions as templates and their components as reusable parts.},

abstract = {Countless voice-enabled user interfaces rely on keyword spotting (KWS) systems for wake word detection and simple command recognition. As a practical matter, these applications run on "edge" devices, where dozens of different platforms exist; typically, platform-dependent implementation are required whenever keyword spotting capabilities are needed. This impedes the rapid deployment of voice-enabled interfaces. Fortunately, with the development of several recent frameworks, JavaScript enables us to deploy neural networks for keyword spotting to support a wide range of speech-based user interfaces. We present three voice-enabled applications that use a unified, JavaScript-based KWS system: an in-browser game, a desktop virtual assistant, and a smart lightbulb controller. We are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the feasibility of JavaScript-based keyword spotting for universal voice-enabled user interfaces.},

In this paper, we present preliminary results on the cognitive load due to a gaze typing task of varying complexities. A pilot study was conducted to observe if a task on gaze typing sentences, of varying complexities, could generate different cognitive load in the participants. The data obtained was from pupils, blink data, pupil oscillation measured in form of Index of Pupillary Activity and subjective scores. Logistic regression was performed to observe the difference between easy and difficult tasks and they were successfully differentiated, with 75% accuracy, using the measures of absolute pupil size, relative pupil size and subjective scores given by the participants.},

abstract = {The Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) is commonly used to predict a user's task completion times with graphical user interfaces. With KLM, the user's behavior is modeled with a linear function of independent, elementary operators. Each task can be completed with a sequence of operators. The policy, or the assumed sequence that the user executes, is typically pre-specified by the analyst. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL), RL-KLM [4] proposes an algorithmic method to obtain this policy automatically. This approach yields user-like policies in simple but realistic interaction tasks, and offers a quick way to obtain an upper bound for user performance.In this demonstration, we show how a policy is automatically learned by RL-KLM in form-filling tasks. A user can interact with the system by placing form fields onto a UI canvas. The system learns the fastest filling order for the form template according to Fitts' Law operators, and computes estimates the time required to complete the form. Attendees are able to iterate over their designs to see how the changes in designs affect user's policy and the task completion time.},

In comparable tools, usually a predefined collection of drum patterns serves as the source for suggestions. In order to yield a greater variety of patterns and to create original patterns, we suggest the use of stochastic generative models. Therefore, in this work, drum patterns are generated using a generative adversarial network, trained on a large-scale drum pattern library. As a method to enter, edit, visualize, and generate patterns, a touch-based step sequencer interface is augmented with controls of the semantic dimensions of genre, complexity, and loudness.},

abstract = {A landscape site plan is a graphic representation to show the arrangement of landscape items(like trees, buildings, and paths) from a top view. Restyling a site plan includes adjusting the colors, textures and other artistic customization, which is the task that landscape architects spend more time to work on nowadays. Landscape-freestyle shows the potential of using machine learning for automatically restyling landscape site plans. Landscape-freestyle recognizes the features (locations and sizes) of each item (trees, buildings, and paths) by an object-recognition algorithm on a styled site plan or by reading data directly on an AutoCAD file site plan. The user can choose to upload a template image offered by themselves or a preset style template offered by Landscape-freestyle for restyling. If they upload templates themselves, a style-recognition algorithm is used to identify the items and their artistic customization from the template image and use it for styling. This work presents our first approach to restyle site plans: recognize tree images on site plans, extract tree features and redraw them with other style templates. This research aims to expose the importance of machine learning to benefit a traditional working flow in the design field in a friendly and fast way.},

Sleep tracking software also struggle with a lack of user transparency and interactivity leading individuals to mistrust the results these applications generate or otherwise not feel like the insights are actionable. To explore these issues, we designed an interventional chat bot to mediate information collection and interaction between end user and sleep monitoring technology. The SleepBot prompts users with simple questions that attempt to elicit insight into larger problems that contribute to poor sleep and help craft successful sleep hygiene behaviors. Text messaging based interaction eases the process as it is similar to talking with a friend, making for a unique environment in which the user is able to share personal data comfortably.},

abstract = {The digitization of museum exhibits has raised the question of how to make these data accessible, particularly in light of the ever growing collections being available. In this demo, we present the VIRTUE system which allows curators to easily set up virtual museum exhibitions of static and dynamic 2D (paintings, photographs, videos, etc.) and 3D artifacts. Visitors may navigate through the virtual rooms, inspect the artifacts and interact with them in novel ways. Participants will be able to use the system by creating their own exhibitions, which they tour as a visitor.},

abstract = {Effective personalization of web experiences constitutes matching user intent to content, while optimizing a set of engagement metrics and catering to diverse consumption mediums. The diversity of user interests necessitates automation in the process of constructing personalized content experiences. We propose a genetic algorithm based framework that chooses a set of content items relevant to a target user, and decides their respective sizes and relative positions to construct a layout. This layout is designed to simultaneously optimize a chosen engagement metric subject to diversity of the information presented. Comparisons against existing frameworks based on human annotations show improved prominence of key content and increased diversity of the content presented.},

These systems present an extremely rich and challenging research space for addressing many aspects of user awareness and adaptation, such as user profiles, contexts, personalities, emotions, social dynamics, conversational styles, etc. Adaptive interfaces are of long-standing interest for the HCI community. Meanwhile, new machine learning approaches are introduced in the current generation of conversational agents, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and active learning. It is imperative to consider how various aspects of user-awareness should be handled by these new techniques. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers in HCI, user modeling, and the AI and NLP communities from both industry and academia, who are interested in advancing the state-of-the-art on the topic of user-aware conversational agents. Through a focused and open exchange of ideas and discussions, we will work to identify central research topics in user-aware conversational agents and develop a strong interdisciplinary foundation to address them.},

Along with this groundbreaking change in mobility pedestrians are forced to interact with such technology. In mixed traffic situations (i.e., manual, semi-automated and autonomous vehicles share a road) it might be crucial for non-motorized traffic participants to know which entity is in control. For example, when considering to cross a road, the degree of automation and the presence of human drivers could influence the decision. Moreover, it is not clear whether conventional communication channels such as turn signals and brake / reversing lights meet the challenges of autonomous traffic. I expect that interaction between automated vehicles and pedestrians includes safety critical challenges which are directly related to acceptance and success of the emerging technology. I want to contribute to the future of autonomous mobility by providing design guidelines on how to support pedestrians in their decision making process in mixed traffic. Furthermore, I want to explore new designs for human-vehicle communication.},

Based on observations in my previous research, these adaptive suggestions adapt to the detected user proficiency and predicted user goal to customize feedback to support user needs. The objectives of this technique are to guide users to 1) learn what verbal commands execute VUI actions and 2) learn the actions supported to accomplish desired tasks with the system.},

abstract = {There is a lack of diversity in the simulations or training, that nursing students get to experience before making their way to a real hospital bedside. There is existing evidence and practical concern for nurses' ability to communicate therapeutically, such as calming and de-escalation techniques, when interacting with a diverse clientele, specifically in the way that they interact with patients. We look at leveraging augmented reality and natural language processing to build on existing simulation labs, giving what is now only a static and uniform simulation mannequin, a face, colors, and most importantly ears and a voice. All for the sake of improved communication and patient satisfaction once this learning is transferred into practice.},

abstract = {Laryngectomy is a surgical treatment that leads to voice loss. Novel approach to regaining communicative function after the operation is presented. In contrast to most technologies using artificial intelligence to restore the voice, it focuses on balancing the use of technology with human compensatory capabilities. A design process that consists of first person participatory design and user interviews is presented. In the current phase proposed device integrates wearable vibrating effector with voice pitch controller and voice amplifying set and dynamical voice conversion system, adding personal traits to the speech signal.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, including machine learning, computer vision, and natural language, requires large amounts of annotated datasets. The current research and development (R&amp;D) pipeline involves each group collecting their own datasets using an annotation tool tailored specifically to their needs, followed by a series of engineering efforts in loading other external datasets and developing their own interfaces, often mimicking some components of existing annotation tools. In departure from the current paradigm, my research focuses on reducing inefficiencies by developing a unified web-based, fully configurable framework that enables researchers to set up an end-to-end R&amp;D experience from dataset annotations to deployment with an application-specific AI backend. Extensible and customizable as required by individual projects, the framework has been successfully featured in a number of research efforts, including conversational AI, explainable AI, and commonsense grounding of language and vision. This submission outlines the various milestones-to-date and planned future work.},
