abstract = {In most interactive systems, the handling of text and images are still quite separate matters. Rendering pipelines handle 2D and 3D graphics, while text tends to be an after-thought which is hardly integrated at the system level, let alone at the level of user interaction.This talk will survey recent developments in the area of image-text interaction from both the system architecture point of view and with respect to user interfaces. The talk will emphasize interactive labelling of 2D and 3D graphics and outline new real-time algorithms for label placement. Labelled images will be discussed as an interface to methods and tools for data mining. Finally, challenges for future developments in the area of image-text interaction will be outlined.},

Based on a technological assessment of the main technological areas involved (miniaturization, communication and network structures, advanced display and speech technologies, as well as sensor integration and deployment) this tutorial will discuss the main approaches in context and user modeling, as well as present new interaction paradigms for ubiquitous computing environments. Examples of past and current research projects of the field will be used to explain and discuss the intersection of UbiComp and IUIs. Having discussed the technical foundations, the tutorial aims to explore the design and development of new pervasive applications for mobile devices and other distributed interfaces. It will explore how handhelds can interact with other surrounding devices, intelligent environments and with the social context. The tutorial will also look at how Participatory Design approaches and advanced in-situ evaluation techniques and ethno-methodologies such as living labs, on-the-field data collection, enactments, and 'Cultural Probes', can lead to the representation of significant communication systems.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, a few malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in recent work [5, 7]. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of spam profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work, we provide a simple unsupervised algorithm, which exploits statistical properties of effective spam profiles to provide a highly accurate and fast algorithm for detecting spam.},

In addition, users expressed higher subjective opinions of the hybrid critiquing interface than the interface simply providing system-proposed critiques, and they would more likely return to it for future use.},

Said communities don't help members find work to do, or do so without regard to individual preferences, such as Slashdot assigning meta-moderation randomly. Yet social science theory suggests that reducing the cost and increasing the personal value of contribution would motivate members to participate more.We present SuggestBot, software that performs intelligent task routing (matching people with tasks) in Wikipedia. SuggestBot uses broadly applicable strategies of text analysis, collaborative filtering, and hyperlink following to recommend tasks. SuggestBot's intelligent task routing increases the number of edits by roughly four times compared to suggesting random articles. Our contributions are: 1) demonstrating the value of intelligent task routing in a real deployment; 2) showing how to do intelligent task routing; and 3) sharing our experience of deploying a tool in Wikipedia, which offered both challenges and opportunities for research.},

Firstly, both technologies harvest and harness "community wisdom" and in an integrated system each of the search and navigation components can benefit from the additional community wisdom gathered by the other when assisting users to locate relevant information. Secondly, by integrating search and browsing we facilitate the development of a unique interface that effectively blends search and browsing functionality as part of a seamless social information access service. This service allows users to effectively combine their search and browsing behaviors. In this paper we will argue that this integration provides significantly more than the simple sum of the parts.},

Others struggle to achieve the critical mass necessary for diverse and engaging conversation. But what tools are available to these communities to increase participation? Our goal in this research was to spark contributions to the movielens.org discussion forum, where only 2% of the members write posts. We developed personalized invitations, messages designed to entice users to visit or contribute to the forum. In two field experiments, we ask (1) if personalized invitations increase activity in a discussion forum, (2) how the choice of algorithm for intelligently choosing content to emphasize in the invitation affects participation, and (3) how the suggestion made to the user affects their willingness to act. We find that invitations lead to increased participation, as measured by levels of reading and posting. More surprisingly, we find that invitations emphasizing the social nature of the discussion forum increase user activity, while invitations emphasizing other details of the discussion are less successful.},

We conducted a think-aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give. Users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions. We found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback. The kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features, feature combinations, relational features, and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm. The results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems, but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback.},

First, our system works with users cooperatively to build an investigative context, which is otherwise very difficult to capture by machine or human alone. Second, we develop a context-aware method that can adaptively retrieve and evaluate information relevant to an ongoing investigation. Experiments show that our approach can improve the relevance of retrieved information significantly. As a result, users can fulfill their investigative tasks more efficiently and effectively.},

abstract = {Intelligent desktop environments allow the desktop user to define a set of projects or activities that characterize the user's desktop work. These environments then attempt to identify the current activity of the user in order to provide various kinds of assistance. These systems take a hybrid approach in which they allow the user to declare their current activity but they also employ learned classifiers to predict the current activity to cover those cases where the user forgets to declare the current activity. The classifiers must be trained on the very noisy data obtained from the user's activity declarations. Instead of asking the user to review and relabel the data manually, we employ an active EM algorithm that combines the EM algorithm and active learning. EM can be viewed as retraining on its own predictions. To make it more robust, we only retrain on those predictions that are made with high confidence. For active learning, we make a small number of queries to the user based on the most uncertain instances. Experimental results on real users show this active EM algorithm can significantly improve the prediction precision, and that it performs better than either EM or active learning alone.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for active learning embedded within an interactive calendar management system that learns its users' scheduling preferences. When the system receives a meeting request, the active learner selects a set of alternative solutions to present to the user; learning is then achieved by noting the user's preferences for the selected schedule over the others presented. To achieve the goals of presenting solutions that meet the user's needs while enhancing the preference-learning process, we introduce a new approach to active learning that makes online decisions about the technique to use in selecting the schedules to present in response to each meeting request. The decision is based on the entropy of the available options: a highly diverse set of possible solutions calls for a selection technique that chooses instances that are different from one another, maximizing coarse-grained learning, whereas a set of possible solutions containing little diversity is met with a selection strategy that promotes fine-grained learning. We present experimental results that indicate that our entropy-driven approach provides a better balance between learning efficiency and user satisfaction than static selection techniques.},

However, accurate topic segmentation of meetings is a difficult task. In this paper, we investigate the idea of acquiring implicit supervision from human meeting participants to solve the segmentation problem. Specifically we have implemented and tested a note taking interface that gives value to users by helping them organize and retrieve their notes easily, but that also extracts a segmentation of the meeting based on note taking behavior. We show that the segmentation so obtained achieves a Pk value of 0.212 which improves upon an unsupervised baseline by 45% relative, and compares favorably with a current state-of-the-art algorithm. Most importantly, we achieve this performance without any features or algorithms in the classic sense.},

Neither category is entirely suitable for capturing know-how from demonstrations in a distributed, collaborative environment, where multiple experts can independently provide examples to improve the model.In this paper we describe Distributed Augmentation-Based Learning (DABL), the first real-time PBD learning algorithm suited for distributed know-how acquisition. DABL is an incremental learning algorithm that uses a version-control-like paradigm to combine independently constructed procedure models. An expert can check out a procedure model from a repository and modify it by means of new demonstrations or by manually editing it. The expert then reconciles the changes with those concurrently made by other experts and checked into the repository.DABL automatically merges the two procedures, learns new decision points based on reconcilable differences, and identifies conflicts where there are multiple valid ways of combining the changes or where the combination produces an invalid model, that is, one that does not lie in the search space of the learning algorithm.},

We introduce a novel approach that exploits the structure of the relational data source(s) to formulate a set of constraints. These constraints are used in conjunction with partial plans to produce an intelligent query interface that (a) does not require the user to know details about data sources or existing values (b) suggests valid inputs to the user (c) creates consistent queries that always return values.},

abstract = {The development of natural multimodal dialogue systems remains a very difficult task. The flexibility and naturalness they offer result in an increased complexity that current software tools do not address appropriately. One challenging issue we address here is the generation of cooperative responses in an appropriate multimodal form, highlighting the intertwined relation of content and presentation. We identify a key component, the dialogic strategy component, as a mediator between the natural dialogue management and the multimodal presentation. This component selects the semantic information content to be presented according to various presentation constraints. Constraints include inherent characteristics of modalities, the availability of a modality as well as preferences of the user. Thus the cooperative behaviour of the system could be adapted as could its multimodal behaviour. In this paper, we present the dialogic strategy component and an associated platform to quickly develop output multimodal cooperative responses in order to explore different dialogic strategies.},

abstract = {The consideration of human feelings in automated music generation by intelligent music systems, albeit a compelling theme, has received very little attention. This work aims to computationally specify a system's music compositional intelligence that tightly couples with the listener's affective perceptions. First, the system induces a model that describes the relationship between feelings and musical structures. The model is learned by applying the inductive logic programming paradigm of FOIL coupled with the Diverse Density weighting metric over a dataset that was constructed using musical score fragments that were hand-labeled by the listener according to a semantic differential scale that uses bipolar affective descriptor pairs. A genetic algorithm, whose fitness function is based on the acquired model and follows basic music theory, is then used to generate variants of the original musical structures. Lastly, the system creates chordal and non-chordal tones out of the GA-obtained variants. Empirical results show that the system is 80.6% accurate at the average in classifying the affective labels of the musical structures and that it is able to automatically generate musical pieces that stimulate four kinds of impressions, namely, favorable-unfavorable, bright-dark, happy-sad, and heartrending-not heartrending.},

abstract = {Inputting mathematical expressions with a mouse and a keyboard is a troublesome task. Thus, a number of mathematical expression recognition systems capable of recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions to input them into computers have been proposed. Even with these systems, however, structure recognition of mathematical expressions is still difficult. This paper presents MathBox, a new pen-based interface for inputting mathematical expressions into computers. MathBox interactively shows "boxes" in which the user can write one symbol. The boxes are shown along with the user's writing. For example, when the user writes 'x,' the boxes for a power and an index of 'x' and for the next symbol are shown. When the user inputs a fraction line, boxes for the numerator, denominator, and the next symbol are shown. MathBox skips recognizing the structures of expressions, which enables users to write mathematical expressions with practical accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on affect recognition from text in order to facilitate sensitive and expressive communication in computer-mediated environments. Our model for analyzing affect conveyed by text is tailored to handle the style and specifics of informal online conversations. The motivation behind our approach is to improve social interactivity and emotional expressiveness of real-time messaging.In order to estimate affect in text, our model processes symbolic cues, such as emoticons, detects and transforms abbreviations, and employs natural language processing techniques for word/phrase/sentence-level analysis, e.g. by considering relations among words in a sentence. As a result of the analysis, text can be categorized into emotional states and communicative functions. A designed graphical representation of a user (avatar) displays emotions and social behaviour driven by text and performs natural idle movements. The proposed system shows promising results on affect recognition in real examples of online conversation.},

abstract = {Preference-based search (PBS) is a popular approach for helping consumers find their desired items from online catalogs. Currently most PBS tools generate search results by a certain set of criteria based on preferences elicited from the current user during the interaction session. Due to the incompleteness and uncertainty of the user's preferences, the search results are often inaccurate and may contain items that the user has no desire to select. In this paper we develop an efficient Bayesian filter based on a group of users' past choice behavior and use it to refine the search results by filtering out items which are unlikely to be selected by the user. Our preliminary experiment shows that our approach is highly promising in generating more accurate search results and saving user's interaction effort.},

The original Find-Me Systems (e.g., Car Navigator) showed static compound critiques; they didn't change irrespective of user preferences or the product availability. Recently, a number of techniques for dynamically generating compound critiques have been proposed. While these techniques have been evaluated in isolation, to date no direct comparison of these (in terms of their interfacing characteristics and recommendation performance) has been reported. Motivated by this, our research groups have come together to carry out this comparison for the approaches we each take. The user study platform that we have developed facilitates the comparison of various critiquing based recommenders. In this paper we report the first set of results from a comprehensive real-user evaluation of two dynamic compound critique systems using this evaluation platform.},

In contrast, visually-disabled individuals have to use screen readers to browse the Web. Screen readers process pages sequentially and read through everything, making Web browsing time-consuming and strenuous. The use of shortcut keys and searching offers some improvements, but the problem still remains. In this paper, we address this problem using the notion of context. When a user follows a link, we capture the context of the link, and use it to identify relevant information on the next page. The content of this page is rearranged, so that the relevant information is read out first. We conducted a series experiments to compare the performance of our prototype system with the state-of-the-art JAWS screen reader. Our results show that the use of context can potentially save browsing time as well as improve browsing experience of visually disabled individuals.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose the use of a social robot as mediator between the user and a smart environment. Since the speech is considered one of the more natural and immediate input channel in human-robot interaction we discuss the importance of recognizing both the linguistic content of the spoken sentence and the valence of the user tone of voice in order to infer properly the user's intent in communication during the interaction.},

abstract = {A model of user-search-engine interaction is developed using the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We test, using an empirical evaluation, the model across different result orderings and relevance distributions, demonstrating that across a number of trials, the model approximates the characteristics of large numbers of users interacting with search-engines. These results are discussed in terms of their practical implications for search interfaces and ranking algorithms.},

abstract = {Interactive Visual Clustering (IVC) is a novel method that allows a user to explore relational data sets interactively, in order to produce a clustering that satisfies their objectives. IVC combines spring-embedded graph layout with user interaction and constrained clustering. Experimental results on several synthetic and real-world data sets show that IVC yields better clustering performance than alternative methods.},

abstract = {Electronic Commerce on the Web is thriving, but consumers still have trouble finding products that will meet their needs and desires. AI has offered many kinds of Recommender Systems [11], but they are all oriented toward searching based on concrete attributes of the product (e.g. price, color) or the user (as in Collaborative Filtering). Based on commonsense reasoning technology, we introduce a novel recommendation technique, Scenario-Oriented Recommendation, which helps users by mapping their daily scenarios to product attributes, and works even when users don't know exactly what products they are looking for.},

abstract = {We address the problem of users creating visualizations to debug and understand multi-agent systems. The key challenges are that (1) needs arise dynamically, i.e., it is difficult to know a priori what visualizations one wants, (2) extensive expertise on the system, the algorithms and visualization tools are often needed for implementation, and (3) agents can be running in a distributed environment. We have developed VizScript, a collection of tools to expedite the process of creating visualizations. VizScript combines a generic application instrumentation, a knowledge base, and simple scene definition primitives with a reasoning system, to produce an easy to use visualization system. Using VizScript we were able to recreate the visualizations for a complex multi-agent system with an order-of-magnitude less effort than was required in a Java implementation.},
