abstract = {With the rapid development of genome sequencing techniques, the traditional research methods of microorganisms based on the isolation and cultivation are gradually replaced by metagenomics, also known as environmental genomics. The first step, which is still a major bottleneck, of metagenomic is the taxonomic characterization of the DNA fragments (reads) resulting from sequencing a sample of mixed species. This step is usually referred as "binning". Existing binning methods belong to supervised or semi-supervised approaches which rely heavily on the reference genomes of known microorganisms and phylogenetic marker genes. Due to the limited availability of reference genomes and the bias and unstable of marker genes, these methods may not be applicable in all cases. In this paper, we present an unsupervised binning method based on the distribution of a careful selected set of l-mers (substrings of length l in reads). From our experiments, we show that our approach can accurately bin DNA fragments with various length and relative species abundance ratio without any reference and training datasets. Another highlight of our approach is error robustness. The binning accuracy only decreases less than 1% while the sequencing error rate increases from 0% to 5% which is much lower than the typical sequencing error rate of entire existing commercial sequencing platform which is less than 2%.The source code of our software tool, the reference genomes of the species for generating the test datasets and the corresponding test datasets are available at http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/.},

abstract = {Diagnosis techniques using urine are non-invasive, inexpensive, and easy to perform in clinical settings. The metabolites in urine, as the end products of cellular processes, are closely linked to phenotypes. Although research using urine metabolome has many advantages, there can also be problems, such as multiple characteristic signals mixing or averaging into undistinguishable signals. As a result, it seems that univariate methods cannot identify precise boundaries between two groups, such as cancerous and normal samples. Moreover, due to individual differences in genetic makeup and heterogeneity in cancer progression, the analysis of combinatorial information from many variables seems to be more suitable than univariate analysis. In this study, we therefore propose classification models using multivariate classification techniques and develop an analysis procedure for classification studies using metabolome data. Through this strategy, we identified five potential urinary biomarkers for breast cancer with high accuracy and also proposed potential diagnosis rules to help in clinical decision making. After further validation with independent cohorts and experimental confirmation, these marker candidates will likely lead to clinically applicable assays for earlier diagnoses of breast cancer. This multivariate classification research is the second trial in metabolome analysis after Denkert et al. and the first for urine metabolome studies.},

abstract = {Although both conservation and correlated mutation (CM) are important information reflecting the different sorts of context in multiple sequence alignment, most of alignment methods use sequence profiles that only represent conservation. There is no general way to represent correlated mutation and incorporate it with sequence alignment yet. We develop a novel method, CM profile, to represent correlated mutation as the spectral feature derived by using linear predictive coding where correlated mutations among different positions are represented by a fixed number of values. We combine CM profile with conventional sequence profile to improve alignment quality. For distantly related protein pairs, using CM profile improves the profile-profile alignment with or without predicted secondary structure. Especially, at superfamily level, combining CM profile with sequence profile improves profile-profile alignment by 9.5% while predicted secondary structure does by 6.0%. More significantly, using both of them improves profile-profile alignment by 13.9%. We also exemplify the effectiveness of CM profile by demonstrating that the resulting alignment preserves share coevolution and contacts. Because of the generality of CM profile, it can be used for other bioinformatics applications in the same way of using sequence profile.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new method to detect candidate cancer genes for developing molecular biomarkers or therapeutic targets from cancer microarray datasets. To resolve problems resulted in the molecular heterogeneity of cancers on gene prioritizing, our proposed method is intended to identify genes that are over- or down- expressed not in the whole cancer samples but also in a subgroup of cancer samples. To this end, we propose the RS score for gene ranking calculated with a weighted running sum statistic on the ordered list of expression values of each gene. We apply the proposed method to publically available prostate cancer microarray datasets, showing that it can identify previously well known prostate cancer associated genes such as ERG, HPN, and AMACR at the top of the list of candidate genes. Embedding samples, represented as vectors of the expression values of the top 20 genes, into a two dimensional space using the commute time embedding shows the distinction between normal samples and cancer samples in the independent test datasets as well as in the training datasets. We further evaluate the proposed method by estimating classification performance on the independent test datasets, and it shows the better classification performance compared to the other cancer outlier profile approaches.},

abstract = {Background: Finding relevant articles from PubMed is challenging because it is hard to express the user's specific intention in the given query interface, and a keyword query typically retrieves a large number of results. Researchers have applied machine learning techniques to find relevant articles by ranking the articles according to the learned relevance function. However, the process of learning and ranking is usually done offline without integrated with the keyword queries, and the users have to provide a large amount of training documents to get a reasonable learning accuracy. This paper proposes a novel multi-level relevance feedback system for PubMed, called RefMed, which supports both ad-hoc keyword queries and a multi-level relevance feedback in real time on PubMed.Results: RefMed supports a multi-level relevance feedback by using the RankSVM as the learning method, and thus it achieves higher accuracy with less feedback. RefMed ``tightly`` integrates the RankSVM into RDBMS to support both keyword queries and the multi-level relevance feedback in real time; the tight coupling of the RankSVM and DBMS substantially improves the processing time. An efficient parameter selection method for the RankSVM is also proposed, which tunes the RankSVM parameter without performing validation. Thereby, RefMed achieves a high learning accuracy in real time without performing a validation process. RefMed is accessible at {sf http://dm.postech.ac.kr/refmed}.Conclusions: RefMed is the first multi-level relevance feedback system for PubMed, which achieves a high accuracy with less feedback. It effectively learns an accurate relevance function from the user's feedback and efficiently processes the function to return relevant articles in real time.},

abstract = {Since Swanson proposed the Undiscovered Public Knowledge (UPK) model, there have been many approaches to uncover UPK by mining the biomedical literature. These earlier works, however, required substantial manual intervention to reduce the number of possible connections and are mainly applied to disease-effect relation. With the advancement in biomedical science, it has become imperative to extract and combine information from multiple disjoint researches, studies and articles to infer new hypothesesand expand knowledge. In this paper, we propose MKEM, a Multi-level Knowledge Emergence Model, to discover implicit relationships using Natural Language Processing techniques such as Link Grammar and Ontologies such as Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) MetaMap. The contribution of MKEM is as follows: First, we propose a flexible knowledge emergence model to extract implicit relationships across different levels such as molecular level for gene and protein and Phenomic level for disease and treatment. Second, we employ MetaMap for tagging biological concepts. Third, we provide an empirical and systematic approach to discover novel relationships. Our experiments show that MKEM is a powerful tool to discover hidden relationships residing in extracted entities that were represented by our Substance-Effect-Process-Disease-Body Part (SEPDB) model.},

abstract = {Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a crucial issue in bio-medical text mining since the performance of diverse biomedical text mining techniques strongly depends on the senses of lexicons. Thus, it is natural to consider lexicons as the most crucial features in WSD. However, due to the diversity of lexical space, WSD methods based on machine learning techniques with lexical features suffer from the difference between distributions of training and test documents. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes support vector machines with example-wise weights. In this method, the training distribution is made coincide with the test distribution by weighting training examples according to their similarity to all test data. The experimental results show that the distribution change between training and test data is actually recognized and the proposed method which considers this change in its training phase outperforms ordinary support vector machines.},

So it is crucial to examine the physical layout relationship between HERVs and genes in the whole genome scale. In this paper we present RetroScope, a new Web-based comparative visualization system for HERV over 4 whole primate genomes including Human, Chimpanzee, Orangutan and Rhesus monkey. So RetroScope enables us to find the retro element which is very close to a specified gene in the form of exonoverlapping or promotor, primer overlapping. Thus our system enables biologist to provide global understanding by comparing the linear configuration of several HERVs in the whole chromosome scales by using a fast HERV alignment algorithm. Also by alignment of HERVs, we can find the most similar pair of chromosomes with respect to the configuration of HERV elements, which would be another clues to construct phylogenetics based on HERV.

abstract = {The microarray is gaining popularity in biomedical research due to its ability to analyze hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously in one experiment. However, the unique nature of microarray data, with a large number of features but relative small number of samples, poses challenges to process the microarray data effectively. The curse of dimensionality introduces the importance of feature extraction in analyzing microarray data. Therefore, we propose a novel incremental method to discover the non-Gaussian weight from the microarray gene expression data with high efficiency. Our proposed method can discover a small number of compact features from a huge number of genes and can still achieve good predictive performance. It integrates non-gaussianity and an adaptive incremental model in an unsupervised way to extract informative features. It is also plausible to analyze microarray data with the number of features much larger than number of observations with promising results.},

abstract = {Biomedical literature is an important source of information in any researcher's investigation of genes, risk factors, diseases and drugs. Often the information searched by public health researchers is distributed across multiple disparate sources that may include publications from PubMed, genomic, proteomic and pathway databases, gene expression and clinical resources and biomedical ontologies. The unstructured nature of this information makes it difficult to find relevant parts from it manually and comprehensive knowledge is further difficult to synthesize automatically. In this paper we report on LITSEEK (LITerature Search by metadata Enhancement with External Knowledgebases), a system we have developed for the benefit of researchers at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to enable them to search the HuGE (Human Genome for Epidemiology) database of PubMed articles, from a pharmacogenomic perspective. Besides analyzing text using TFIDF ranking and indexing of the important terms, the proposed system incorporates an automatic consultation with PharmGKB - a human-curated knowledge base about drugs, related diseases and genes, as well as with the Gene Ontology, a human-curated, well accepted ontology. We highlight the main components of our approach and illustrate how the search is enhanced by incorporating additional concepts in terms of genes/drugs/diseases (called metadata for ease of reference) from PharmGKB. Various measurements are reported with respect to the addition of these metadata terms. Preliminary results in terms of precision based on expert user feedback from CDC are encouraging. Further evaluation of the search procedure by actual researchers is under way.},

abstract = {Clinical systematic reviews are based on expert, laborious search of well-annotated literature. Boolean search on bibliographic databases, such as MEDLINE, continues to be the preferred discovery method, but the size of these databases, now approaching 20 million records, makes it impossible to fully trust these searching methods. We are investigating the trade-offs between Boolean and ranked retrieval. Our findings show that although Boolean search has limitations, it is not obvious that ranking is superior, and illustrate that a single query cannot be used to resolve an information need. Our experiments show that a combination of less complicated Boolean queries and ranked retrieval outperforms either of them individually, leading to possible time savings over the current process.},

abstract = {Motivation: Although gene expression data has been continuously accumulated and meta-analysis approaches have been developed to integrate independent expression profiles into larger datasets, the amount of information is still insufficient to infer large scale genetic networks. In addition, global optimization such as Bayesian network inference, one of the most representative techniques for genetic network inference, requires tremendous computational load far beyond the capacity of moderate workstations.Results: MONET is a Cytoscape plugin to infer genome-scale networks from gene expression profiles. It alleviates the shortage of information by incorporating pre-existing annotations. The current version of MONET utilizes thousands of parallel computational cores in the supercomputing center in KISTI, Korea, to cope with the computational requirement for large scale genetic network inference.Availability: A cytoscape plugin is available at http://cytoscape.org and a web service is at http://delsol.kaist.ac.kr/~monet/home},

abstract = {This project assembles a virtual team consisting of personnel from the New Jersey Institute of Technology with expertise in the data mining domain and the Saint Barnabas Health Care System with expertise in the medical domain. We apply proven techniques in data and text mining to the problem of hospital mortality. Methodology in outcomes research using data/text mining has typically included Bayesian Networks to include decision trees and rules, regression analysis or Neural Networks/Support Vector Machines to analyze a single disease or condition. We propose to instead analyze the entire spectrum of reasons patients are admitted to a hospital in an effort to discern what chronologies result in good outcomes and which in the worst outcome so as to identify the characteristics to be avoided throughout the spectrum of reasons for admission.},
