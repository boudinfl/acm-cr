abstract = {One of the most essential parts of any recommender system is personalization– how acceptable the recommendations are from the user’s perspective. However, in many real-world applications, there are other stakeholders whose needs and interests should be taken into account. In this work, we define the problem of multistakeholder recommendation and we focus on finding algorithms for a special case where the recommender system itself is also a stakeholder. In addition, we will explore the idea of incremental incorporation of system-level objectives into recommender systems over time to tackle the existing problems in the optimization techniques which only look for optimizing the individual users’ lists.},

abstract = {With billions of users, social networks have become the go to platform for information diffusion for news media outlets. Lately, certain entities (users and/or organizations) have been active in generating misinformation in order to attract users to their respective websites, to generate online advertisement revenues, to increase followers, to create political instability, etc. With the increasing presence of misinformation on social networks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to not only distinguish between information and misinformation, but also, to identify the source(s) of misinformation propagation. This effort reviews my doctoral research on identifying the source(s) of misinformation propagation. Particularly, I utilize the mathematical concept of Identifying Codes to uniquely identify users who become active in propagating misinformation. In this paper, I formally present the computation of the Minimum Identifying Code Set (MICS) as a novel variation of the traditional Graph Coloring problem. Furthermore, I present an Integer Linear Program for the computation of the MICS. I apply the technique on various anonymous Facebook network datasets and show the effectiveness of the approach.},

abstract = {The scientific literature is a large information network linking various actors (laboratories, companies, institutions, etc.). The vast amount of data generated by this network constitutes a dynamic heterogeneous attributed network (HAN), in which new information is constantly produced and from which it is increasingly difficult to extract content of interest. In this article, I present my first thesis works in partnership with an industrial company, Digital Scientific Research Technology. This later offers a scientific watch tool, Peerus, addressing various issues, such as the real time recommendation of newly published papers or the search for active experts to start new collaborations. To tackle this diversity of applications, a common approach consists in learning representations of the nodes and attributes of this HAN and use them as features for a variety of recommendation tasks. However, most works on attributed network embedding pay too little attention to textual attributes and do not fully take advantage of recent natural language processing techniques. Moreover, proposed methods that jointly learn node and document representations do not provide a way to effectively infer representations for new documents for which network information is missing, which happens to be crucial in real time recommender systems. Finally, the interplay between textual and graph data in text-attributed heterogeneous networks remains an open research direction.},

abstract = {Complex networks are a powerful paradigm to model complex systems. Specific network models, e.g., multilayer networks, temporal networks, and signed networks, enrich the standard network representation with additional information to better capture real-world phenomena. Despite the keen interest in a variety of problems, algorithms, and analysis methods for these types of network, the problem of extracting cores and dense structures still has unexplored facets.In this work, we present advancements to the state of the art by the introduction of novel definitions and algorithms for the extraction of dense structures from complex networks, mainly cores. At first, we define core decomposition in multilayer networks together with a series of applications built on top of it, i.e., the extraction of maximal multilayer cores only, densest subgraph in multilayer networks, the speed-up of the extraction of frequent cross-graph quasi-cliques, and the generalization of community search to the multilayer setting. Then, we introduce the concept of core decomposition in temporal networks; also in this case, we are interested in the extraction of maximal temporal cores only. Finally, in the context of discovering polarization in large-scale online data, we study the problem of identifying polarized communities in signed networks.The proposed methodologies are evaluated on a large variety of real-world networks against na\"{\i}ve approaches, non-trivial baselines, and competing methods. In all cases, they show effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. Moreover, we showcase the usefulness of our definitions in concrete applications and case studies, i.e., the temporal analysis of contact networks, and the identification of polarization in debate networks.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is to systematically extract information from hacker forums, whose information would be in general described as unstructured: the text of a post is not necessarily following any writing rules. By contrast, many security initiatives and commercial entities are harnessing the readily public information, but they seem to focus on structured sources of information. Here, we focus on the problem of analyzing text content in security forums. A key novelty is that we use user profiles and contextual features along with transfer learning approach and also embedding space to help us identify and refine information that we could not get from security forum with trivial analysis. We collect a wealth of data from 5 different security forums. The contribution of our work is twofold; (a) we develop a method to automatically identify through the forums malicious IP addresses (b) we also propose a systematic method to identify and classify user-specified threads of interest into four categories. We further showcase how this information can inform knowledge extraction from the forums. As the cyber-wars are becoming more intense, having early accesses to useful information becomes more imperative to remove the hackers first-move advantage, and our work is a solid step towards this direction.},

abstract = {The study of information-sharing cascades has been a constant endeavor since the emergence of social networks. Internet memes which mostly consist of catchphrases, viral images, or small videos shared over the social network are notorious for attracting the users’ attention and spreading through the web in a fast fashion. Misinformation propagators latch their message to a meme to maximize the influence and spreading of the false news. As a result, the diffusion of misleading content has become a force to be reckoned with in the field of information warfare, as foreign actors seek to change opinions, manipulate ideologies, and create conflicts. In this study, we analyze the rapid dissemination of misinformation, aka, misinformation cascades, focusing on cascade temporal behavior and multi-cascade influence relationships. Twitter data used in this study contains only information associated with the Russian Internet Agency (IRA) and the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). Our study focuses on analyzing temporal patterns of information dynamics created by these foreign actors for the sole purpose of spreading misinformation. We explore dividing temporal cascades into phases, where each phase differs from the previous regarding the number and characteristics of the information bursts. For this preliminary study, we are focusing on the #Trump and #USA hashtags used by the ICA. By studying the dynamics behind each phase, the forces behind the transition from one phase to another, and the influence relationships between cascades and their phases, we expect to shed some light on the timely subject of how to identify and protect society from information manipulation campaigns.},

abstract = {The rise of big data frameworks has given website administrators the ability to track user clickstream data with more detail than ever before. These clickstreams can represent the user’s intent and purpose in visiting the site. While existing work has explored methods for predicting future user actions, these methods are limited focus solely on one task at a time, ignore graph structure inherent in clickstreams, or model the conversion of the entire clickstream session, ignoring complexities such as multiple conversions in a single session. In this work, we formulate the novel problem of simultaneously predicting future user actions given a user’s clickstream history. We argue that clickstream data contains important signal for predicting future user action. To tackle this new problem, we propose a novel method called ClickGraph, a recurrent neural network that encodes the graph structure of user click trajectories in the learned representations of web pages. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset and demonstrate that this multitask learning approach is effective at improving the prediction of form fill conversions over strong baselines. In particular, we demonstrate that the ClickGraph model is effective at reducing false positive rates, increasing F1 scores, and improving recall.},

abstract = {Advancements in technology have enabled society to become increasingly globalised, both with regard to physical migration, as well as through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enable the maintenance of transnational ties. In particular, transient migration in the area of higher education has seen an increasing number of students migrate overseas for the purpose of their studies. However, research has shown that these international students are often disconnected from their host culture and society, with local-international friendships proving to be uncommon (Baldassar &amp; McKenzie, 2016). Based on interviews with over 200 international students in Australia, Sawir et al. (2008) revealed that two-third of them had suffered or were suffering from loneliness, of which Sawir et al. identified three kinds -personal loneliness from loss of contact with families, social loneliness from the loss of networks, and cultural loneliness from the change in environment. This raises the question of how these students may be better supported, and the international student experience improved upon.Social media has often been positioned as a tool through which users become connected and communities are formed. One of the most popular platforms of social media, Facebook, has become an established part of many lives in modern society. Media and culture have always been interconnected, however, the dominance of the Web in everyday lives means that the role that media plays in cross-cultural communication is more significant than ever and must be researched for a better understanding of this phenomenon. While current research has examined the issues relating to construction of online identities for communication within established social networks, new issues have emerged in relation to collapsed contexts and imagined audiences in today's globalised world, especially as multiple cultures are introduced onto the same platform as a result of migration or relocation. Insufficient research has been done into the influence of technology on transient migration and its potential to support cross-cultural communication. The question thus is how exactly social media may assist transient migrants overcome issues of isolation and loneliness, and provide them with support during their time abroad.This study looks to address the issue of student isolation within host societies by examining how social media may provide spaces for support, self-expression and cross-cultural communication. Through a visual internet ethnographic study, it examines the profile pages of international students on Facebook to better understand their positions in these home and host societies. This research study is supplemented by semi-structured interviews for a thorough examination of international students’ use of social media.As we examine how the Web has developed and changed over the last 30 years, it must be acknowledged that this change cannot be solely attributed to technological advancements, but is also influenced by the actual human users of the Web who participate in it. Web users utilise online tools to produce content of their own, tailoring their online experiences accordingly. While advancements in technology has created a more globalised society, the globalised users within this society have had their own impact on technology. This research looks to create a more in-depth understanding of the ways in which social networking platforms are used by transient migrants to navigate transnational cultural settings. It is aimed at enabling deeper understanding of the complex inter-linkages between cultures, to engender new insights of transnational identities. This is essential to address the global nature of today's society and the role of social media platforms in the spaces they create for transient migrants.},

abstract = {The Entity Linking (EL) task is concerned with linking entity mentions in a text collection with their corresponding knowledge-base entries. Despite the progress made in the evaluation of EL systems, there is still much work to be done, where this Ph.D. research tackles issues concerning EL evaluation. Among these issues, we stress (a)&nbsp;the lack of consensus about the definition of “entity” and the lack of evaluation metrics that allow for different notions of entities, (b)&nbsp;the lack of datasets that allow for cross-language comparison, and (c)&nbsp;the focus on evaluating high-level systems rather than low-level techniques. By addressing these challenges and better understanding the performance of EL systems, our hypothesis is that we can create a more general, more configurable EL framework that can be better adapted to the needs of a particular application. In the early stages of this PhD work, we have identified these problems and begun to address (a) and (b), publishing initial results that constitute a significant step forward in our investigation. However, there are still further challenges that must be addressed before we reach our goal. Our next steps thus involve proposing a more fluid definition of “entity” adaptable to different applications, the definition of quality measures that allow for comparing EL approaches targeting different types of entities, as well as the creation of a customizable EL framework that allows for composing and evaluating individual techniques as appropriate to a particular task.},

abstract = {The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data–driven approaches, with an emphasis on classification accuracy. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well–defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of aggressive messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim. Existing work has focused on aggression (i.e., using profanity to classify toxic comments independently) as an indicator of cyberbullying, disregarding the repetitive nature of this harassing process. However, raising a cyberbullying alert immediately after an aggressive comment is detected can lead to a high number of false positives. At the same time, three key practical challenges remain unaddressed: (i) detection timeliness, which is necessary to support victims as early as possible, (ii) scalability to the staggering rates at which content is generated in online social networks, (iii) reliance on high quality annotations from human experts for training of highly accurate supervised classifiers.To overcome the challenges associated with cyberbullying detection in online social networks, my PhD thesis focuses on a novel formulation of the online classification problem as sequential hypothesis testing that seeks to drastically reduce the number of features used while maintaining high classification accuracy. To reduce the dependency on labeled datasets, I seek to develop efficient semisupervised methods that extrapolate from a small seed set of expert annotations. Preliminary results are very encouraging, showing significant improvements over the state–of–the–art.},

While gaze estimation based on a standard camera can be versatile, it remains challenging to achieve an accurate, robust, and scalable solution on mobile devices. In this talk, I will describe three studies that aim to address these challenges. Specifically, 1) we found that screen reflection on user's cornea can be leveraged for gaze estimation and it considerably improves the practicability of indoor eye tracking. 2) We exploited gaze-hand coordination and applied interaction data for implicit calibration when a user naturally interacts with the computer. This can prevent users from tedious and intrusive calibration in practice. 3) We also proposed to train a multi-device person-specific gaze estimator to accelerate implicit calibration. It adapts the data from different personal devices to learn the shared mapping from user appearance into eye gaze. Taken together, these studies identify indicative eye gaze features, alleviate user calibration effort, and thus pave the way for scalable eye tracking in daily use.},

abstract = {Visual attention and eye movements in primates have been widely shown to be guided by a combination of stimulus-dependent or 'bottom-up' cues, as well as task-dependent or 'top-down' cues. Both the bottom-up and top-down aspects of attention and eye movements have been modeled computationally. Yet, it is not until recent work which I will describe that bottom-up models have been strictly put to the test, predicting significantly above chance the eye movement patterns, functional neuroimaging activation patterns, or most recently neural activity in the superior colliculus of human or monkey participants inspecting complex static or dynamic scenes. In recent developments, models that increasingly attempt to capture top-down aspects have been proposed. In one system which I will describe, neuromorphic algorithms of bottom-up visual attention are employed to predict, in a task-independent manner, which elements in a video scene might more strongly attract attention and gaze. These bottom-up predictions have more recently been combined with top-down predictions, which allowed the system to learn from examples (recorded eye movements and actions of humans engaged in 3D video games, including flight combat, driving, first-person, or running a hot-dog stand that serves hungry customers) how to prioritize particular locations of interest given the task. Pushing deeper into real-time, joint online analysis of video and eye movements using neuromorphic models, we have recently been able to predict future gaze locations and intentions of future actions when a player is engaged in a task. In a similar approach where computational models provide a normative gold standard against a particular individual's gaze behavior, machine learning systems have been demonstrated which can predict, from eye movement recordings during as little as only 5 minutes of watching TV, whether a person has ADHD or other neurological disorders. Together, these studies suggest that it is possible to build fully computational models that coarsely capture some aspects of both bottom-up and top-down visual attention.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the effectiveness of personalized persuasive interventions to change urban travelers’ mobility behavior and nudge them towards more sustainable transport choices. More specifically, we embed a set of persuasive design elements in a route planning application and investigate how they affect users’ travel choices. The design elements take into consideration the style, the intensity, the target of persuasive interventions as well as users’ characteristics and the trip purpose. Our results show evidence that our proposed approach motivates users on a personal level to change their mobility behavior and make more sustainable choices. Furthermore, by personalizing the persuasive interventions while considering combinations of interventions styles (in our case messages and visualizations) as well as adjusting the intensity of persuasive interventions according to the trip purpose and the transport modes of the routes which the user is nudged to follow, the effects of the persuasive interventions can be increased.},

abstract = {MAAS as a mobility model leans on the idea that a gap between private and public transport systems needs to be bridged as well as on a city, intercity, national and supranational level. The current situation is felt problematic due to the fragmented tools and services often organized in silos to meet a traveler needs to undertake a trip. One of the major concerns designing any platform system like Mobility as a Service is where to start modeling and how to express the notion of the platform system in some language that is understandable for all stakeholders of the platform system. Understandability buttresses the expectation of stakeholders whether some design will probably implement the intended platform services enabling users to actually buy and or use the platform system for what ever purpose. Building on the economic theories of two-sided markets and mechanism design we introduce the concept of value nets extending the Contract Protocol Net. Value net modeling offers a precise abstract representation which provides in the detailed informational requirements in a canonical form and it connects i.e. implements the abstract notion of Service Oriented Architecture characterizing systems without loss of crucial informational elements.},

abstract = {Looking ahead, in about 20 years, there is likely to be urban air mobility in larger cities across the globe. If economic predictions come true, thousands of air taxi flights will take place daily in capital cities – not only in megacities. Noise generated by urban flight mobility has been identified as a critical factor in this development. A concept is proposed to help raise the tolerance level for urban air noise among communities as well as of individual residents by means of transparency. This concept views residents as stakeholders in urban air mobility and widens the call for continuous noise measurements of vertical take-off and landing operations on individual site basis [1] by residents voluntary on-site data collection enabled by smartphone-based participatory noise sensing (PNS). In the presentation of this concept, this discussion paper describes important aspects of social acceptance of urban air mobility.},

abstract = {Tourist trip recommender systems (RSs) support travelers in identifying the most attractive points of interests (POIss) and combine the POIss along a route for single- or multi-day trips. Most RSs consider only the quality of POIss when searching for the best recommendation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that also considers the attractiveness of the routes between POIss. For this purpose, we identify a list of important attributes of route attractiveness and explain how to implement our approach using three exemplary attributes. We develop a web application for demonstration purposes and apply it in a small preliminary user study with 16 participants. The results show that the integration of route attractiveness attributes makes most people choose the more attractive route over the shortest path between two POIss. This paper highlights how tourist trip RSs can support smart tourism. Our work aims to encourage further discussion on collecting and providing environmental data in cities to enable such applications.},

abstract = {Sustainable mobility is one of the main goals of both European and United Nations plans for 2030. The concept of Smart Cities has arisen as a way to achieve this goal by leveraging IoT interconnected devices to collect and analyse large quantities of data. However, several works have pointed out the importance of including the human factor, and in particular, citizens, to make sense of the collected data and ensure their engagement along the data value chain. This paper presents the design and implementation of two end-to-end hybrid human-machine workflows for solving two mobility problems: modal split estimation, and mapping mobility infrastructure. For modal split, we combine the use of i-Log, an app to collect data and interact with citizens, with reinforcement learning classifiers to continuously improve the accuracy of the classification, aiming at reducing the required interactions from citizens. For mobility infrastructure, we developed a system that uses remote crowdworkers to explore the city looking for Points of Interest, that is more scalable than sending agents on the field. Crowdsourced maps are then fused with existing maps (if available) to create a final map that then is validated on the field by citizens engaged through the i-Log app.},

abstract = {Managing the ever increasing road traffic congestion due to enormous vehicular growth is a big concern all over the world. Tremendous air pollution, loss of valuable time and money are the common consequences of traffic congestion in urban areas. IoT based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can help in managing the road traffic congestion in an efficient way. Estimation and classification of the traffic congestion state of different road segments is one of the important aspects of intelligent traffic management. Traffic congestion state recognition of different road segments helps the traffic management authority to optimize the traffic regulation of a transportation system. The commuters can also decide their best possible route to the destination based on traffic congestion state of different road segments. This paper aims to estimate and classify the traffic congestion state of different road segments within a city by analyzing the road traffic data captured by in-road stationary sensors. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system is used to classify traffic congestion states. Based on traffic congestion status, ITS will automatically update the traffic regulations like, changing the queue length in traffic signal, suggesting alternate routes. It also helps the government to device policies regarding construction of flyover/alternate route for better traffic management.},

abstract = {Cities have entered the age of the sensor and located sensors everywhere over and under cities. The sensors monitor a host of factors that assess City operations and life such as air quality, noise, city services and traffic. Further, the sensors have “gone mobile” with announcements of situation aware mobile sensor platforms designed for city-level security and public safety. These wearable sensor platforms combine video, audio, and location data with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. However, the many sensors and functional platforms have not yet made the cities employing these many diverse sensors truly Smart. We are analyzing why the success toward the Smart city is limited, or late in coming. The explanations for the constrained effectiveness are assigned to many factors, but one of significance can be teased from a long-accepted explanation that associates data, information, and knowledge. Smart Cities need to effectively use the sensor data and the information assembled from these interpreted and organized data to create knowledge that serves the city and its people by answering and resolving key problems and questions. But the systems and analytic models needed to associate these data from many sensors have yet to be designed, constructed, and proven in the complex cities of today. Thus, the data (and information from the diverse sensors) lacks crucial integration and coordination for decisions and sense-making. While these sensor-based systems were, and in many cases are meeting some intended functionally discrete goals, they appear to be better described as data collection tools feeding centralized analytical engines. They are point solutions with specialized or targeted sensors feeding specialized solutions. This is a significant limiting factor in a city's drive to improve the quality of life and the efficiency of the services a city provides to its stakeholders. In this paper we present current trends in Smart City development, emerging issues with data and complexity growth, and proposes a mean to leverage the advancing technologies to address the integration problem.},

abstract = {Smart technologies advancements, emerging markets competition and sustainability needs have radically changed tourism and transport sectors. The key features of this change are the exploitation of evolving Big Data in the business intelligence context, the development of customized services tailored to the needs of consumers with the purpose of improving their experience, and the development of new business models based on the interaction between business and consumers. This is due to the capacity of smart transport technologies to integrate customers sensing and in this way a novel framework aimed at: i) developing personalized transport services in the tourism sector and ii) creating and delivering patterns of tourist consumer behavior according to specific target groups and market segments at tourist destination or country level is designed and outlined. The proposed “TΟMI” framework, exploits tour data analytics, in order to enable the deployment of personalized tour services that will be beneficial for tour operators, travellers and any other interested parties (local stakeholders, tourism entrepreneurs, etc.). The exploitation of the “TOMI” framework for the purpose of organizing tours in a city is also addressed through a case study on the city of Thessaloniki.},

abstract = {Travel time estimates are highly useful in planning urban mobility events. This paper investigates the quality of travel time estimates in the Indian capital city of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). Using Uber mobile and web applications, we collect data about 610 trips from 34 Uber users. We empirically show the unpredictability of travel time estimates for Uber cabs. We also discuss the adverse effects of such unpredictability on passengers waiting for the cabs, leading to a whopping 28.4% of the requested trips being cancelled. Our empirical observations differ significantly from the high accuracies reported in travel time estimation literature. These pessimistic results will hopefully trigger useful investigations in future on why the travel time estimates are mismatching the high accuracy levels reported in literature - (a) is it a lack of training data issue for developing countries or (b) an algorithmic shortcoming that cannot capture the (lack of) historical patterns in developing region travel times or (c) a conscious policy decision by Uber platform or Uber drivers, to mismatch the correctly predicted travel time estimates and increase cab cancellation fees? In the context of smartphone apps extensively generating and utilizing travel time information for urban commute, this paper identifies and discusses the important problem of travel time estimation inaccuracies in developing countries.},

abstract = {With the increasing availability of mobility-related data, such as GPS-traces, Web queries and climate conditions, there is a growing demand to utilize this data to better understand and support urban mobility needs. However, data available from the individual actors, such as providers of information, navigation and transportation systems, is mostly restricted to isolated mobility modes, whereas holistic data analytics over integrated data sources is not sufficiently supported. In this paper we present our ongoing research in the context of holistic data analytics to support urban mobility applications in the Data4UrbanMobility (D4UM) project. First, we discuss challenges in urban mobility analytics and present the D4UM platform we are currently developing to facilitate holistic urban data analytics over integrated heterogeneous data sources along with the available data sources. Second, we present the MiC app - a tool we developed to complement available datasets with intermodal mobility data (i.e. data about journeys that involve more than one mode of mobility) using a citizen science approach. Finally, we present selected use cases and discuss our future work.},

As spam bots have become more advanced over time, creating algorithms to identify bots remains an open challenge. Learning low-dimensional embeddings for nodes in graph structured data has proven to be useful in various domains. In this paper, we propose a model based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) for spam bot detection. Our hypothesis is that to better detect spam bots, in addition to defining a features set, the social graph must also be taken into consideration. GCNNs are able to leverage both the features of a node and aggregate the features of a node’s neighborhood. We compare our approach, with two methods that work solely on a features set and on the structure of the graph. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt of using graph convolutional neural networks in spam bot detection.},
