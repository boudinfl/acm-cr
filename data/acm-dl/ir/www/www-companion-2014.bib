abstract = {As GPS-enabled mobile devices have advanced, the location-based service(LBS) became one of the most active subjects in the Web-based services. Major Web-based services such as Google Picasa, Twitter, Facebook, and Flicker employ LBS as one of their main features. Consequently, a large number of geotagged documents are generated by users in the Web-based services. Recently, there have been studies on the spatial keyword search which aims to find a set of documents in the Web-based services by evaluating the spatial relevance and keyword relevance. It is a combination of the spatial search and keyword search, each of which has been studied for a long time.In this paper, we address the spatial semantic search problem which is to find top k relevant sets of documents with spatial constraints and semantic constraints. For devising an effective solution of the spatial semantic search, we propose a hybrid index strategy, a ranking model and an efficient search algorithm. In addition, we present the current status of our research progress, and discuss remaining challenges and future works.},

Recently, researchers focus on higher semantic levels to what human would need to understand the contents of articles. While human can smoothly interpret documents when they have knowledge of the context of documents, they have difficulty with those as their context is lost or changes. In this PhD proposal, we address three novel research questions: detecting uninterpretable pieces in documents, retrieving contextual information and constructing compact context for the documents, then propose approaches to these tasks, and discuss related issues.},

abstract = {With the emergence of massive information networks, graph data have become ubiquitous for various applications. Although many graph processing problems have been studied recently, entity linking on graph data has not received enough attention by the academia and industry, which finds vertex pairs that refer to the same entity from two graphs. There are two main research challenges arising in this problem. The first one is how to determine whether two vertices refer to the same entity which is rather hard for graph data, especially uncertain data, e.g., social networks. The second challenge is to efficiently link the vertices. As existing graph data are rather large, it is very important to devise efficient algorithms to achieve high performance. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a similarity-based method which takes the vertex pairs with similarity larger than a given threshold as linked entities. We extend existing textual similarity and structural similarity to evaluate similarity between vertices from different graphs. To achieve high quality, we also combine them and propose a hybrid similarity. We also discuss new algorithms to efficiently link entities. We conduct experimental studies on real datasets and the results proves show that our hybrid method achieves high performance and outperform the baseline approaches.},

abstract = {Navigating websites represents a fundamental activity of users on the Web. Modeling this activity, i.e., understanding how predictable human navigation is and whether regularities can be detected has been of interest to researchers for nearly two decades. This is crucial for improving the Web experience of users by e.g., enhancing interfaces or information network structures. This thesis envisions to shedding light on human navigational patterns by trying to understand, leverage and improve human navigation on the Web. One main goal of this thesis is the construction of a versatile framework for modeling human navigational data with the use of Markov chains and for detecting the appropriate Markov chain order by using several advanced inference methods. It allows us to investigate memory and structure in human navigation patterns. Furthermore, we are interested in detecting whether pragmatic human navigational data can be leveraged by e.g., being useful for the task of calculating semantic relatedness between concepts. Finally, we want to find ways of enhancing human navigation models. Concretely, we plan on incorporating prior knowledge about the semantic relatedness between concepts to our Markov chain models as it is known that humans navigate the Web intuitively instead of randomly. Our experiments should be conducted on a variety of distinct navigational data including both goal oriented and free form navigation scenarios. We not only look at navigational paths over websites, but also abstract away to navigational paths over topics in order to get insights into cognitive patterns.},

abstract = {In recent times, focus of information retrieval community has shifted from traditional keyword-based retrieval to techniques utilizing the semantics in the text. Since such techniques require the understanding of relationships between entities, efforts are ongoing to organize the Web into large entity-relationship graphs. These graphs can be leveraged to answer complex relationship queries. However, most of the research has focused upon extracting structural information between entities such as a path, Steiner tree, or subgraphs. Little attention has been paid to the comprehension of these structural results, which is necessary for the user to understand relationships encapsulated in these structures. In this doctoral proposal, we pursue the idea of entity-centric summarization and propose a novel framework to produce entity-centric summaries which describe the relationships among input entities. We discuss the inherent challenges associated with each module in the framework and present an evaluation plan. Results from our preliminary experiments are encouraging and substantiate the feasibility of summarization problem.},

abstract = {Many activities people perform on the Web are biased, including activities like reading news, searching for information and connecting with people. Sometimes these biases are inherent in social behavior (like homophily), and sometimes they are external as they affect the system (like media bias). In this thesis proposal, we describe our approach to use information visualization to enhance Web activities performed by regular people (i.e., non-experts) We understand enhancing as reducing bias effects and generating an engaging response from users. Our methodology is based on case studies. We select a Web activity, identify the biases that affect it, and evaluate how the biases affect a population from online social networks using web mining techniques, and then, we design a visualization following an interactive and playful design approach to diminish the previously identified biases. We propose to evaluate the effect of our visualization designs in user studies by comparing them with state-of-the-art techniques considering a playful experiences framework.},

abstract = {Taggers in social tagging systems have the main role in giving identities to the objects. Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identities of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have effect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folksonomy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social relations based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic communities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tagging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic communities of related taggers around the tagged objects. Because our perceptions in each specific area of knowledge is evolving over time, the goal of our approach is also to evolve the represented knowledge in semantic tagging systems dynamically according to the latest perception of the related users.},

Despite the central role played by strategic interactions in creating values in the Internet environment, our ability to understand them scientifically and to manage them in practice has remained limited. While engineering communities suffer from not having enough theoretical resource to formalize such phenomena, economics and social sciences lack adequate technology to properly operationalize their theoretical insights, thereby demanding an integrative solution. This project aims to develop a rational-choice-theory-driven framework for computational social science, focusing on social interactions on the Internet. In order to suggest theoretical foundations, validation of the predictions in a controlled environment, and verification of the results in actual platforms, general approaches and a few examples of ongoing research are presented.},

abstract = {With the increasing size of web data and widely adopted parallel cloud computing paradigm, distributed database and other distributed data processing systems, for example Pregel and GraphLab, use data partitioning technology to divide the large data set. By default, these systems use hash partitioning to randomly assign data to partitions, which leads to huge network traffic between partitions. Fine-grained partitioning can better allocate data and minimize the number of nodes involved within a transaction or job while balancing the workload across data nodes as well. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype system, Lute, to provide highly efficient fine-grained partitioning scheme for these distributed systems. Lute maintains a lookup table for each partitioned data set that maps a key to a set of partition ID(s). We use a novel lookup table technology that provides low cost of reading and writing lookup table. Lute provides transaction support and high concurrency writing with Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) as well.We implemented a prototype distributed DBMS on Postgresql and used Lute as a middle-ware to provide fine-grained partitioning support. Extensive experiments conducted on a cluster demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach. The evaluation results show that in comparison with other state-of-the-art lookup table salutations, our approach can significantly improve throughput by about 20% to 70% on TPC-C benchmark.},

abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm emerged with service oriented principles. In the cloud setting, organizations outsource their IT equipment and manage their business processes through virtual services that are typically exchanged over HTTP. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) depict the status of running services. SLAs represent operational contracts that allow providers to estimate their service avail- ability according to their resource capacity. The SLA data schema and content are operationally defined by the type, volume and relations of service elements that organizations operate on their physical resources. Current lack of a uniform SLA standardization leads to semantic and operational differences between SLAs, that are produced and consumed by different organizations. Such differences prohibit common business SLA practices in the cloud computing domain. Our research introduces systematic SLA data management to describe the formalization, storage and processing of SLAs over distributed computing environments. Services in scope are framed within the cloud computing context.},

More importantly, the LASER system manages the various aspects of online controlled experiments, namely the selection of participants into groups, exposure of different user interface features or recommendation algorithms to these groups, measuring their responses, and summarizing the results in the visual manner.},

In this demonstration, we present a system called WINE (Why-not questIon aNswering Engine) which takes the first step to systematically answer the why-not questions posed by end-users on TagIR systems. It is based on three explanation models, namely result reordering, query relaxation, and query substitution, that enable us to explain a variety of why-not questions. Our answer not only involves the reason why desired images are missing in the results but also suggestion on how the search query can be altered so that the user can view these missing images in sufficient number.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a system for fast and intuitive exploration of the Freebase dataset. This required solving several non-trivial problems, including: entity scores for proper ranking and name disambiguation, a unique meaningful name for every entity and every type, extraction of canonical binary relations from multi-way relations (which in Freebase are modeled via so-called mediator objects), computing the transitive hull of selected relations, and identifying and merging duplicates. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we provide for download an up-to-date version of the Freebase data, enriched and simplified as just sketched. Second, we offer a user interface for exploring and searching this data set. The data set, the user interface and a demo video are available from http://freebase-easy.cs.uni-freiburg.de.},

abstract = {An increasing share of today's work is knowledge work. Adaptive Case Management (ACM) assists knowledge workers in handling this collaborative, emergent and unpredictable type of work. Finding suitable workers for specific functions still relies on manual assessment and assignment by persons in charge, which does not scale well. In this paper we discuss a tool for ACM to facilitate this expert finding leveraging existing Web technology. We propose a method to automatically recommend a set of eligible workers utilizing linked data, enriched user profile data from distributed social networks and information gathered from case descriptions. This semantic recommendation method detects similarities between case requirements and worker profiles. The algorithm traverses distributed social graphs to retrieve a ranked list of suitable contributors to a case according to adaptable metrics. For this purpose, we introduce a vocabulary to specify case requirements and a vocabulary to describe skill sets and personal attributes of workers. The semantic recommendation method is demonstrated by a prototypical implementation using a WebID-based distributed social network.},

EVIN exploits different kinds of similarity measures among news, referring to textual contents, entity occurrences, and temporal ordering. These similarities are captured in a multi-view attributed graph. To distill canonicalized events, EVIN coarsens the graph by iterative merging based on a judiciously designed loss function. To infer semantic classes of events, EVIN uses statistical language models. EVIN provides a GUI that allows users to query the constructed knowledge base of events, and to explore it in a visual manner.},

abstract = {The opportunities of the Internet combined with new devices and technologies change the end users' habits in media consumption. While end users often search for related information to the currently watched TV show by themselves, we propose to improve this user experience by automatically enriching media using semantic extraction. In our recent work we focused on how to apply media enrichment to distributed screens. Based on the findings we made from our recent prototype we identify several problems and describe how we deal with them. We illustrate a way to achieve cross-platform real-time synchronization using several transport protocols. We propose the usage of sessions to handle multi-user, multi-screen scenarios and introduce techniques for new interaction and customization patterns. We extend our recent approach with the extraction of keywords from given subtitles by utilizing statistical algorithms and natural language processing technologies, which are then used to discover and display related content from the Web. The prototype presented in this paper reflects the improvements of our work. We discuss next research steps and define challenges for further research.},

However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowd-sourced or extracted data of often relatively low quality. We present Databugger, a framework for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. Databugger ensures a basic level of quality by accompanying vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases with a number of test cases. The formalization behind the tool employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test queries. The test queries can be instantiated automatically based on a vocabulary or manually based on the data semantics. One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

SemFacet is implemented on top of the Yago knowledge base, powered by the OWL 2 RL triple store RDFox, and the full text search engine Lucene. SemFacet has provided very encouraging results. Via logical reasoning SemFacet can automatically (i) extract facets, (ii) update the faceted query interface with facets relevant for the current stage of the users query construction's session. SemFacet supports faceted queries that are much more expressive than the ones of traditional faceted search applications; in particular SemFacet allows to (i) relate several collections of documents, and (ii) change the focus of queries (and, thus, SemFacet provides control over the documents in the query output to be displayed on the screen). Our approach is fully declarative: the same backend implementation can be used to power faceted search over any application, provided that metadata and knowledge are represented in RDF and OWL 2.},

Our G* system enables efficient storage and querying of these graph snapshots by taking advantage of their commonalities. In extending G* for scalable and robust operation, we found the classic challenges of data distribution and replication to be imbued with renewed significance. If multiple graph snapshots are commonly queried together, traditional techniques that distribute data over all servers or create identical data replicas result in inefficient query execution. We propose to verify, using live demonstrations, the benefits of our graph snapshot distribution and replication techniques. Our distribution technique adjusts the set of servers storing each graph snapshot in a manner optimized for popular queries. Our replication technique maintains each snapshot replica on a different number of servers, making available the most efficient replica configurations for different types of queries.},

In this paper we demonstrate a use case in which cross domain communication is applied in the Web of Things using the HTML5 Cross Document Messaging API (HTML5CDM). In addition, we contribute an advanced implementation of HTML5CDM that brings RESTful communication model to HTML5CDM and supports better concurrent message exchange, which we believe will be of much benefit to web developers. In addition, a time/space evaluation that measures CPU and Memory usage for the developed HTML5CDM library is carried out and the results has proved our implementation's practicability.},

abstract = {Measuring the effectiveness of marketing campaigns across different channels is one of the most challenging tasks for today's brand marketers. Such measurement usually relies on a combination of key performance indicators (KPIs), used for assessing various aspects of marketing outcomes. Recently, with the availability of social-media sources, new options for collecting KPIs have become available and numerous social-media monitoring tools and services have emerged. Yet, given the vast media spectrum, which goes beyond social-media channels, existing solutions fail to generalize well and the curation of marketing performance KPIs for most marketing channels still relies on labor intensive means such as surveys and questionnaires. Trying to address the challenges, we propose to demonstrate a novel solution we have developed in IBM: Multi-channel Marketing Monitoring Platform (M3P for short). M3P is better tailored for the marketing performance domain, where online chatter is being harnessed for effective collection of meaningful marketing KPIs across all possible channels. We describe M3P's main challenges and review some of its novel KPIs. We then describe the M3P solution, focusing on its KPI extraction process. Finally, we describe the planned demonstration using a real-world marketing use-case.},

In the aggregation step of audio and visual cues, our system automatically detects the available channel for the final rank.

AIDR has been successfully tested to classify informative vs. non-informative tweets posted during the 2013 Pakistan Earthquake.

abstract = {It would be very difficult even for a resident to characterise the social dynamics of a city and to reveal to foreigners the evolving activity patterns which occur in its various areas. To address this problem, however, large amount of data produced by location-based social networks (LBSNs) can be exploited and combined effectively with techniques of user profiling. The key idea we introduce in this demo is to improve city areas and venues classification using semantics extracted both from places and from the online profiles of people who frequent those places. We present the results of our methodology in LiveCities, a web application which shows the hidden character of several italian cities through clustering and information visualisations paradigms. In particular we give in-depth insights of the city of Florence, IT, for which the majority of the data in our dataset have been collected. The system provides personal recommendation of areas and venues matching user interests and allows the free exploration of urban social dynamics in terms of people lifestyle, business, demographics, transport etc. with the objective to uncover the real `pulse' of the city. We conducted a qualitative validation through an online questionnaire with 28 residents of Florence to understand the shared perception of city areas by its inhabitants and to check if their mental maps align to our results. Our evaluation shows how considering also contextual semantics like people profiles of interests in venues categorisation can improve clustering algorithms and give good insights of the endemic characteristics and behaviours of the detected areas.},

abstract = {With the increasing volume of location-annotated content from various social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare, we now have real-time access to people's daily documentation of local activities, interests and attention. In this demo paper, we present CityBeat, a real-time visualization of hyper-local social media content for cities. The main objective of CityBeat is to provide users -- with a specific focus on journalists -- with information about the city's ongoings, and alert them to unusual activities. The system collects a stream of geo-tagged photos as input, uses time series analysis and classification techniques to detect hyper-local events, and compute trends and statistics. The demo includes a visualization of this information that is designed to be installed on a large-screen in a newsroom, as an ambient display.},

However, the efficient, user friendly exploration of spatial data remains a major challenge. We present Facete, a web-based exploration and visualization application enabling the spatial-faceted browsing of data with a spatial dimension. Facete implements a novel spatial data exploration paradigm based on the following three key components: First, a domain independent faceted filtering module, which operates directly on SPARQL and supports nested facets. Second, an algorithm that efficiently detects spatial information related to those resources that satisfy the facet selection. The detected relations are used for automatically presenting data on a map. And third, a workflow for making the map display interact with data sources that contain large amounts of geometric information. We demonstrate Facete in large-scale, real world application scenarios.},

abstract = {Location-based services, and in particular personal navigation systems, have become increasingly popular with the widespread use of GPS technology in smart devices. Existing navigation systems are designed to suggest routes based on the shortest distance or the fastest time to a target. In this paper, we propose a new type of route navigation based on regional context---primarily sentiments. Our system, called SocRoutes, aims to find a safer, friendlier, and more enjoyable route based on sentiments inferred from real-time, geotagged messages from Twitter. SocRoutes tailors routes by avoiding places with extremely negative sentiments, thereby potentially finding a safer and more enjoyable route with marginal increase in total distance compared to the shortest path. The system supports three types of traveling modes: walking, bicycling, and driving. We validated the idea based on crime history data from the City of Chicago Portal in December 2012, and sentiments extracted from geotagged tweets during the same time. We discovered that there was a significant correlation between regional Twitter posting sentiments and crime rate, in particular for high-crime and highly negative sentiment areas. We also demonstrated that SocRoutes, by solely utilizing social media sentiments, can find routes that bypass crime hotspots.},

Settings span cold start users and advanced users for whom personalization is possible. In this context, top-$k$ and skylines are discussed as they form a key approach that spans the web, data mining, and database communities.

Microblog data contains short documents, SMS kind of language, and is full of code mixing. Though a lot of it is mere social babble, it also contains fresh news coming from human sensors at a humungous rate. Given such interesting characteristics, the world wide web community has witnessed a large number of research tasks for microblogging platforms recently. Event detection on Twitter is one of the most popular such tasks with a large number of applications. The proposed tutorial on social analytics for Twitter will contain three parts. In the first part, we will discuss research efforts towards detection of events from Twitter using both the tweet content as well as other external sources. We will also discuss various applications for which event detection mechanisms have been put to use. Merely detecting events is not enough. Applications require that the detector must be able to provide a good description of the event as well. In the second part, we will focus on describing events using the best phrase, event type, event timespan, and credibility. In the third part, we will discuss user profiling for Twitter with a special focus on user location prediction. We will conclude with a summary and thoughts on future directions.},

The mentality of combating big data by throwing in more hardware/machines will quickly become highly expensive since data is growing at an extremely fast rate oblivious to any cost concerns from us. "Learning to efficiently rank" offers a cost-effective solution to ranking on large data (e.g., billions of documents). That is, it addresses a critically important question -- whether it is possible to improve ranking effectiveness on large data without incurring (too much) additional cost?},

Our goal is to design efficient algorithms for finding opinion leaders such that changing their opinions has great impact on the overall opinion of the society.We define a set of problems like maximizing the sum of individual opinions or maximizing the number of individuals whose opinions are above a threshold. We discuss the complexity of the defined problems and design optimum algorithms for the non NP-hard variants of the problems. Furthermore, we run simulations on real-world social network data and show our proposed algorithm outperforms the classical algorithms such as degree-based, closeness-based, and pagerank-based algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of discovering and learning sensational 2-episodes, i.e., pairs of co-occurring news events. To find all frequent episodes, we propose an efficient algorithm, MEELO, which significantly outperforms conventional methods. Given many frequent episodes, we rank them by their sensational effect. Instead of limiting ourselves to any individual subjective measure of sensational effect, we propose a learning-to-rank approach that exploits multiple features to capture the sensational effect of an episode from various aspects. An experimental study on real data verified our approach's efficiency and effectiveness.},

This framework also helps users to create and share so-called micro-themes, which is applicable to the above generated content for the purpose of page styling and also highly reusable thanks to the adopted semantic attribute selectors.},

We acquire contextual knowledge for sentiment analysis by asking workers to indicate the contexts that influence the polarities of sentiment words. The increased complexity of the task causes some workers to give superficial answers. To increase motivation, we make the task more engaging by packaging it as a game. With the knowledge compiled from only a small set of answers, we already halve the gap between machine and human performance. This proves the strong potential of human computation for acquiring commonsense knowledge.},

We demonstrate that two mechanisms can explain these disparities: directed triadic closure, which leads to networks that show characteristics of status-oriented behavior, and reciprocation, which leads to friendship-oriented behavior. We develop a model that demonstrates how variances in these mechanisms lead to characteristic differences in the expression of network subgraph motifs. Lastly, we show how a user's future popularity, her indegree, can be predicted based on her initial edge creation behavior.},

It embeds several editors (a WYSIWYG editor, and an HTML/JavaScript editor + a JavaScript library manager) for coding in the browser, provides an API for exploiting semantic metadata, and uses a graph based data store and an object oriented database for persistence on the server side. It has been specially designed for writing online programming tutorials (i.e. an HTML5 tutorial, a semantic web tutorial on how to consume linked data, etc.), or more generally for developing web applications that can be mixed with more classical wiki documents (in fact all WikiNEXT pages are web applications).

In this poster, we define a novel model to identify overlapping communities as well as hubs and outliers. When K is given, we propose a normalized symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to learn the parameters of the model. Otherwise, we introduce a Bayesian symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization to learn the parameters of the model, while determining K.

In this work, we study how to properly recommend advertising messages for mobile device users. We propose a novel approach which simultaneously considers several important factors: user profile, apps used, and clicking history. We apply experiments on real-world mobile log data, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Therefore, several algorithms have been proposed to obtain a local optimal ranking with greedy approximations. In this paper, a pruned exhaustive search algorithm is proposed to decrease the complexity of the optimal search for the diversified search problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can decrease the computation complexity of exhaustive search without any performance loss.},

However, none of these applications sufficiently enable users to do their research directly within the application. In fact, users typically have to switch to a browser and write a query on a search engine. Switching to a search engine is distracting and hurts productivity. Furthermore, the main problem is that the search engine is not aware of important user context such as the book that they are reading or the document they are authoring. To tackle this problem, we introduce the notion of contextual insights: providing users with information that is contextually relevant to the content that they are consuming or authoring. We then present Leibniz, a system that provides a solution for the contextual insights problem.},

A user model is trained and continuously updated from the gaze input throughout the whole session in both systems. We conducted an experiment with 24 users, each performing four search tasks using the proposed systems and compared the results to a baseline system, which does not employ any gaze data. The Gaze feedback system users viewed 22.35% more images than the users of the baseline system. A high correlation between the number of saved images and the satisfaction with the results was observed in data collected from the users of a mouse feedback system enriched by gaze data. The results show that including the gaze data into the relevance calculation in both cases increases the degree of satisfaction with the search results compared with the baseline.},

Under the matching constraints given by this bipartite graph between workers and tasks, we design our incentive-compatible mechanism truthuniform which allocates the tasks to the workers, while ensuring budget feasibility and achieves near-optimal utility for the requester. Apart from strong theoretical guarantees, we carry out experiments on a realistic case study of Wikipedia translation project on Mechanical Turk.

We consider a problem of discovering such rules from data using Constrained Sparse PCA. The constraints are put in place to account for cases when evidence in data suggests a relation that is not appropriate for advertising.

Can we leverage some form of cross market data/features for effective query-entity matching in sparse markets? Our solution consists of three main modules: (1) Cross Market Training Data Leverage (CMTDL) (2) Cross Market Feature Leverage (CMFL), and (3) Cross Market Output Data Leverage (CMODL). Each of these parts perform "signal" sharing at different points during the classification process. Using a combination of these strategies, we show significant improvements in query-impression weighted coverage for the query-entity matching task.},

In this paper we explore how to adapt the dynamic copy-paste provenance model of Buneman et al. to RDF datasets that change over time in response to SPARQL updates, how to represent the resulting provenance records themselves as RDF using named graphs in a manner compatible with W3C PROV, and how the provenance information can be provided as a SPARQL query. The primary contribution is a semantic framework that enables the semantics of SPARQL Update to be used as the basis for a `cut-and-paste' provenance model in a principled manner.},

To describe the categories, we propose a hybrid method that integrates a topic model with TF-ICF for extracting both explicitly presented and implicitly latent features. Our evaluation result shows that it gives the highest performance, compared to other approaches.

Semantics-driven variants such as SF-IDF additionally take into account term meaning by exploiting synsets from semantic lexicons. However, they ignore the various semantic relationships between synsets, providing only for a limited understanding of news semantics. Moreover, semantics-based weighting techniques are not able to handle - often crucial - named entities, which are usually not present in semantic lexicons. Hence, we extend SF-IDF by also considering the synset semantic relationships, and by employing named entity similarities using Bing page counts. Our proposed method, Bing-SF-IDF+, outperforms TF-IDF and SF-IDF in terms of F1 scores and kappa statistics.},

Acquiring the social network over mobile users would enable lots of applications, such as friend recommendation and energy-saving mobile DB management. In this paper, we propose to infer the social relationships using the sensor data, which contains the encounter records between individuals, without any knowledge about the real friendships in prior. We propose a two-phase prediction method for the social inference.

To tackle such problem, we devise a visiting time inference framework, VisTime-Miner, which considers the route-based visiting correlation of time labels to model the visiting behavior of a location.

abstract = {Online video websites receive huge amount of videos daily from users all around the world. How to provide valuable recommendation of videos to viewers is important for video websites. Previous studies focus on analyzing the view count of a video, which measures the video's value in terms of popularity. However, the long-lasting value of an online video, namely longevity, is hidden behind the history that a video accumulates its "popularity" through time. Generally speaking, a longevous video tends to constantly draw society's attention. With a focus on Youtube, this paper proposes a scoring mechanism to quantify the longevity of videos. We introduce the concept of latent social impulses and use them to assess a video's longevity. In order to derive latent social impulses, we view the video website as a digital signal filter and formulate the task as a convex minimization problem. The proposed longevity computation is based on the derived social impulses. Unfortunately, the required information to derive social impulses is not always public, which disallows a third party to directly evaluate the longevity of all videos. Thus, we formulate a semi-supervised learning task by using videos of which the longevity scores are known to predict the unknown ones. We develop a Gaussian Random Markov Field model with Loopy Belief Propagation to solve it. The experiments on Youtube demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction results comparing to two baseline models.},

To address these problems, we propose a novel imputation method, which effectively densifies a rating matrix by filling unevaluated ratings with probable values. In our method, we use a trust network to estimate the unevaluated ratings accurately. We conduct experiments on the Epinions dataset and demonstrate that our method helps provide better recommendation accuracy than previous methods, especially for cold-start users.},

Optimizing different representations for different data domains is infeasible in a practical setting on the Internet. Mining such representations from the data in an unsupervised manner is desirable. In this paper, we study a representation based on the multi-scale harmonic analysis of term-term co-occurrence graph. This representation is not only sparse, but also leads to the discovery of semantically coherent topics in data. In our experiments on user-generated short documents e.g., newsgroup messages, user comments, and meta-data, we found this representation to outperform other representations across different choice of classifiers. Similar improvements were also observed for data sets in Chinese and Portuguese languages.},

To answer the above question, we propose CatchSync, which exploits two tell-tale signs of the suspicious behavior: (a) synchronized behavior: the zombie followers have extremely similar following behavior pattern, because, say, they are generated by a script; and (b) abnormal behavior: their behavior pattern is very different from the majority. Our CatchSync introduces novel measures to quantify both concepts and catches the suspicious behavior. Moreover, we show it is effective in a real-world social network.},

Although techniques have been developed to address this challenge, a flexible approach that spans multiple levels of granularity in user interests has not been forthcoming. In this work, we focus on exploiting hierarchical semantics of concepts to infer richer user interests expressed as a Hierarchical Interest Graph. To create such graphs, we utilize users' tweets to first ground potential user interests to structured background knowledge such as Wikipedia Category Graph. We then adapt spreading activation theory to assign user interest score to each category in the hierarchy. The Hierarchical Interest Graph not only comprises of users' explicitly mentioned interests determined from Twitter, but also their implicit interest categories inferred from the background knowledge source.},

abstract = {Among the many tasks driven by very large scaled web search queries, it is an interesting task to predict how likely queries about a topic become popular (a.k.a. trending or buzzing) as the news in the near future, which is known as "Detecting trending queries." This task is nontrivial since the realization of buzzing trends of queries often requires sufficient statistics through users' activities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that predicts whether queries become trending in the future. In principle, our system is built on the two learners. The first is to learn dynamics of time series for queries. The second, our decision maker, is to learn a binary classifier that determines whether queries become trending. Our framework is extremely efficient to be built taking advantage of the grid architecture that allows to deal with the large volume of data. In addition, it is flexible to continuously adapt as trending patterns evolve. The experiments results show that our approach achieves high quality of accuracy (over 77.5%) true positive rate) and yet detects much earlier (on average 29 hours advanced) than that of the baseline system.},

abstract = {This study explores the users' web browsing behaviors that confront phishing situations for context-aware phishing detection. We extract discriminative features of each clicked URL, i.e., domain name, bag-of-words, generic Top-Level Domains, IP address, and port number, to develop a linear chain CRF model for users' behavioral prediction. Large-scale experiments show that our method achieves promising performance for predicting the phishing threats of users' next accesses. Error analysis indicates that our model results in a favorably low false positive rate. In practice, our solution is complementary to the existing anti-phishing techniques for cost-effectively blocking phishing threats from users' behavioral perspectives.},

abstract = {Contextual Advertising (CA) is an important area in the industry of online advertising. Typically, CA algorithms return a set of related ads based on some keywords extracted from the content of webpages. Therefore, extracting the best set of representative keywords from a given webpage is the key to the success of CA. In this paper, we introduce a new keywords generation approach that uses some novel NLP features including POS and named-entities tagging. Unlike most of the existing keyword extraction algorithms, our proposed framework is able to generate some related keywords which do not exist in the webpage. A monetization parameter, predicted from historical search keyword performance, is also used to rank potential keywords in order to balance the RPM (Revenue Per 1000 Matches) and relevance. Experimental results over a very large real-world data set shows that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art system in both relevance and monetization metrics.},

Traditionally used methods such as bag-of-words or latent semantic models consider queries, questions and answers in a same feature space. However, the correlations among queries, questions and answers imply that they lie in different feature spaces. In light of these issues, we proposed a tri-modal deep boltzmann machine (tri-DBM) to extract unified representation for query, question and answer. Experiments on Yahoo!

With widespread adoption of heterogeneous processors, recent JavaScript-based data-parallel programming models, such as River Trail and WebCL, support multiple types of processing elements including CPUs and GPUs. However, significant performance gains are still left on the table since the program kernel runs on only one compute device, typically selected at kernel invocation. This paper proposes a new framework for efficient work sharing between CPU and GPU for data-parallel JavaScript workloads. The work sharing scheduler partitions the input data into smaller chunks and dynamically dispatches them to both CPU and GPU for concurrent execution. For four data-parallel programs, our framework improves performance by up to 65% with a geometric mean speedup of 33% over GPU-only execution.},

Towards this end we present a language for sanitizing RDF graphs, which comprises a set of sanitization operations that transform a graph by concealing the sensitive data.

In a test on a social network with 1.8 billion edges, the algorithm finds the largest clique in about 20 minutes. Key to the efficiency of our algorithm are an initial heuristic procedure that finds a large clique quickly and a parallelized branch and bound strategy with aggressive pruning and ordering techniques.

Then, salient local fea-tures in a word sequence are combined to form a global feature vector. Finally, the high-level semantic information of the word sequence is extracted to form a global vector representation. The proposed models are trained on clickthrough data by maximizing the conditional likelihood of clicked documents given a query, us-ing stochastic gradient ascent. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a large-scale, real-world data set.

The contextual variation in an action that is private (like rating a movie on Netflix), to one shared with friends online (like sharing an item on Facebook), to one that is completely public (like commenting on a Youtube video) introduces behavioral differences that pose interesting challenges. In this paper, we show that users' interests manifest in actions that spill across different types of channels such as sharing, browsing, and purchasing. This motivates leveraging all such signals available from the e-commerce platform. We show that carefully incorporating signals from these interactions significantly improves share prediction accuracy.},

As text-based CAPTCHAs (TBC) have become increasingly difficult to solve, image-based CAPTCHAs, and particularly face recognition CAPTCHAs (FRC), offer a chance to overcome TBC limitations. In this paper, we systematically design and implement a practical FRC, informed by psychological findings. We use gray-scale and binary images, which are computationally inexpensive to generate and deploy. Furthermore, our FRC complies with CAPTCHA design guidelines, thereby ensuring its robustness.},

For instance, long tail queries containing subtle and subjective design concepts, like "calm and quiet", "elegant", "dark background with a hint of color to make it less boring", are poorly supported. This is mainly due to the inherent complexity of the task, which so far has been tackled only algorithmically using general image search techniques. We propose a powerful new approach based on crowdsourcing, which complements existing algorithmic approaches and addresses their shortcomings. Out of many explored crowdsourcing configurations we found that (1) a design need should be represented via several query images and (2) AMT crowd workers should assess a query-specific relevance of a candidate example from a pre-built design collection. To test the utility of our approach, we compared it with Google Images in a query-by-example mode. Based on feedback from expert designers, the crowd selects more relevant design examples.},

This paper presents an approach to systematically extend choreographed mashups with visualization and tailoring facilities. A first user study demonstrates that usability of the resulting solutions increases if proposed awareness and control facilities are integrated.},

By formalizing product information in this way, better product comparison or recommendation applications could be built. Our approach employs both lexical and syntactic matching for mapping properties and instantiating values.

We observe two major refinements behaviors. One is to simplify the original query and the other is to specify it. Both could be modeled by predicting the length (number of terms) of queries when candidates are being ranked. Two experimental results on the real query logs of a commercial search engine demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

Addressing these problems, we first propose an optimized local tag propagation algorithm to generate tags for profiling Weibo users and then use a Chinese knowledge graph accompanied by an improved ESA (explicit semantic analysis) for semantic matching of cross-domain tags.

Experiments using data from a popular mobile app store show that our model is better in predicting the future download trend of the apps as well as the future uninstallation rate of the apps. We believe such model will be very useful in generating more credible and appropriate mobile app recommendations to users, or in generating features for machine learning systems in more complex prediction tasks.},

abstract = {Search advertising shows trends of vertical extension. Vertical ads typically offer better Return of Investment (ROI) to advertisers as a result of better user engagement. However, campaign and bids in vertical ads are not set at the keyword level. As a result, the matching between user query and ads suffers low recall rate and the match quality is heavily impacted by tail queries. In this paper, we propose a retail ads retrieval framework based on query rewrite using personal history data to improve ads recall rate. To insure ads quality, we also present a relevance model for matching rewritten queries with user search intent, with a particular focus on rare queries. Extensive experiments are carried out on large-scale logs collected from the Bing search engine, and results show our system achieves significant gains in ads retrieval rate without compromising ads quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to leverage user behavioral data in ad matching and apply it to the vertical ads domain.},

abstract = {Influence maximization [4] is NP-hard under the Linear Threshold (LT) model, where a line of greedy algorithms have been proposed. The simple greedy algorithm [4] guarantees accuracy rate of 1-1/e to the optimal solution; the advanced greedy algorithm, e.g., the CELF algorithm [6], runs 700 times faster by exploiting the submodular property of the spread function. However, both models lack efficiency due to heavy Monte-Carlo simulations during estimating the spread function. To this end, in this paper we derive an upper bound for the spread function under the LT model. Furthermore, we propose an efficient UBLF algorithm by incorporating the bound into CELF. Experimental results demonstrate that UBLF, compared with CELF, reduces about 98.9% Monte-Carlo simulations and achieves at least 5 times speed-raising when the size of seed set is small.},

abstract = {Knowledge about the general graph structure of the World Wide Web is important for understanding the social mechanisms that govern its growth, for designing ranking methods, for devising better crawling algorithms, and for creating accurate models of its structure. In this paper, we describe and analyse a large, publicly accessible crawl of the web that was gathered by the Common Crawl Foundation in 2012 and that contains over 3.5 billion web pages and 128.7 billion links. This crawl makes it possible to observe the evolution of the underlying structure of the World Wide Web within the last 10 years: we analyse and compare, among other features, degree distributions, connectivity, average distances, and the structure of weakly/strongly connected components.Our analysis shows that, as evidenced by previous research, some of the features previously observed by Broder et al. are very dependent on artefacts of the crawling process, whereas other appear to be more structural. We confirm the existence of a giant strongly connected component; we however find, as observed by other researchers, very different proportions of nodes that can reach or that can be reached from the giant component, suggesting that the "bow-tie structure" is strongly dependent on the crawling process, and to the best of our current knowledge is not a structural property of the web.More importantly, statistical testing and visual inspection of size-rank plots show that the distributions of indegree, outdegree and sizes of strongly connected components are not power laws, contrarily to what was previously reported for much smaller crawls, although they might be heavy-tailed. We also provide for the first time accurate measurement of distance-based features, using recently introduced algorithms that scale to the size of our crawl.},

As a result, the evolution of communities on a semantic level, i.e. how concepts emerge, and how these concepts relate to previously discussed concepts, has largely been ignored. In this paper we present a graph-based exploration of the semantic evolution of online communities, thereby capturing dynamics of online communities on a conceptual level. We first examine how semantic graphs (concept graphs and entity graphs) of communities evolve, and then characterise such evolution using logistic population growth models. We demonstrate the value of such models by analysing how sample communities evolve and use our results to predict churn rates in community forums.},

abstract = {Data about migration flows are largely inconsistent across countries, typically outdated, and often inexistent. Despite the importance of migration as a driver of demographic change, there is limited availability of migration statistics. Generally, researchers rely on census data to indirectly estimate flows. However, little can be inferred for specific years between censuses and for recent trends. The increasing availability of geolocated data from online sources has opened up new opportunities to track recent trends in migration patterns and to improve our understanding of the relationships between internal and international migration. In this paper, we use geolocated data for about 500,000 users of the social network website "Twitter". The data are for users in OECD countries during the period May 2011- April 2013. We evaluated, for the subsample of users who have posted geolocated tweets regularly, the geographic movements within and between countries for independent periods of four months, respectively. Since Twitter users are not representative of the OECD population, we cannot infer migration rates at a single point in time. However, we proposed a difference-in-differences approach to reduce selection bias when we infer trends in out-migration rates for single countries. Our results indicate that our approach is relevant to address two longstanding questions in the migration literature. First, our methods can be used to predict turning points in migration trends, which are particularly relevant for migration forecasting. Second, geolocated Twitter data can substantially improve our understanding of the relationships between internal and international migration. Our analysis relies uniquely on publicly available data that could be potentially available in real time and that could be used to monitor migration trends. The Web Science community is well-positioned to address, in future work, a number of methodological and substantive questions that we discuss in this article.},

abstract = {The Web has grown to be an integral part of modern society offering novel ways for humans to communicate, interact, and share information. New collaborative platforms are forming which are providing individuals with new communities and knowledge bases and, at the same time, offering insights into human activity for researchers, policy-makers and engineers. On a global scale, the role of cultural and language barriers when studying such phenomena becomes particularly relevant and presents significant challenges: due to insufficient information, it is often hard to establish the cultural or language groups in which individuals belong, while there are technical difficulties in establishing the relevance and in analysing resources in different languages. This paper presents a framework to the end of addressing those issues by leveraging data on the use of Wikipedia. Resources available in different languages are explicitly correlated in Wikipedia along with time-stamped logs of access to its articles. This paper provides a framework to enable temporal page views in Wikipedia to be associated with specific geographic profiles. This framework is then used to examine the exchange of information between the English speaking and Chinese speaking localities and reports initial findings on the role of language and culture in diffusion in this context.},

The prohibitive costs of census data collection make that very difficult. To avoid allocating resources upon outdated indicators, one could partly update or complement them using digital data. It has been shown that it is possible to use social media in developed countries (mainly UK and USA) for such a purpose. Here we show that this is the case for Brazil too. We analyze a random sample of a microblogging service popular in that country and accurately predict the GDPs of 45 Brazilian cities. To make these predictions, we exploit the sociological concept of glocality, which says that economically successful cities tend to be involved in interactions that are both local and global at the same time. We indeed show that a city's glocality, measured with social media data, effectively signals the city's economic well-being.},

Using three real-world folksonomies gathered from bookmarks in BibSonomy, CiteULike and Flickr, we show how incorporating a time-dependent component outperforms conventional "most popular tags" approaches and another existing and very effective but less theory-driven, time-dependent recommendation mechanism. By combining our approach with a simple resource-specific frequency analysis, our algorithm outperforms other well-established algorithms, such as FolkRank, Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization and Collaborative Filtering. We conclude that our approach provides an accurate and computationally efficient model of a user's temporal tagging behavior. We demonstrate how effective principles of information retrieval can be designed and implemented if human memory processes are taken into account.},

Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites form excellent repositories of collective knowledge. To make these sites self- sustainable and long-lasting, it is crucial to ensure that new users as well as the site veterans who provide most of the answers keep engaged with the site. As such, quantifying the engagement of users and preventing churn in Q&amp;A sites are vital to improve the lifespan of these sites. We study a large data collection from stackoverflow.com to identify significant factors that correlate with newcomer user churn in the early stage and those that relate to veterans leaving in the later stage. We consider the problem under two settings: given (i) the first k posts, or (ii) first T days of activity of a user, we aim to identify evidential features to automatically classify users so as to spot those who are about to leave. We find that in both cases, the time gap between subsequent posts is the most significant indicator of diminishing interest of users, besides other indicative factors like answering speed, reputation of those who answer their questions, and number of answers received by the user.},

Web observatories are platforms that enable researchers to collect, analyze and share data about the Web and to share tools for Web research. At the Boston Web Observatory Workshop 2013, a semantic model for describing Web Observatories was drafted and an extension to the schema.org microdata vocabulary collection was proposed. This paper details our implementation of the proposed extension, and how we have applied it to the Web Observatory Portal created by the Tetherless World Constellation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (TWC RPI). We recognize this effort to be the "first-step" in the construction, evaluation and validation of the Web observatory model and not the final recommendation. Our hope is that this extension recommendation and our initial implementation sparks additional discussion among the Web Science community of on whether such direction enables Web Observatory curators to better expose and explain their individual Web Observatories to others, thereby enabling better collaboration between researchers across the Web Science community.},

For each of these properties, we compare and contrast with available data from other social networks. These analyses provide a set of authoritative statistics that the community can reference. In addition, we use these data to investigate an often-posed question: Is Twitter a social network or an information network? The "follow" relationship in Twitter is primarily about information consumption, yet many follows are built on social ties. Not surprisingly, we find that the Twitter follow graph exhibits structural characteristics of both an information network and a social network. Going beyond descriptive characterizations, we hypothesize that from an individual user's perspective, Twitter starts off more like an information network, but evolves to behave more like a social network. We provide preliminary evidence that may serve as a formal model of how a hybrid network like Twitter evolves.},

In this paper, we study how closed triads are formed in dynamic networks. More specifically, given three persons, what are the fundamental factors that trigger the formation of triadic closure? There are various factors that may influence the formation of a relationship between persons. Can we design a unified model to predict the formation of triadic closure? Employing a large microblogging network as the source in our study, we formally define the problem and conduct a systematic investigation. The study uncovers how user demographics and network topology influence the process of triadic closure. We also present a probabilistic graphical model to predict whether three persons will form a closed triad in dynamic networks.

abstract = {Nowadays, people are increasingly concerned about smog disaster and the caused health hazard. However, the current methods for big smog analysis are usually based on the traditional lagging data sources or merely adopt physical environment observations, which limit the methods' accuracy and usability. The discipline of Web Science, the research fields of which include web of people and web of devices, provides real time web data as well as novel web data analysis approaches. In this paper, both social web data and device web data are proposed for smog disaster analysis. Firstly, we utilize social web data to define and calculate Individual Public Health Indexes (IPHIs) for smog caused health hazard quantification. Secondly, we integrate social web data and device web data to build standard health hazard rating reference and train smog-health models for health hazard prediction. Finally, we apply the rating reference and models to online and location-sensitive smog disaster monitoring, which can better guide people's behaviour and government's strategy design for disaster mitigation.},

The WikiTimes project provides structured access to WCEP by extracting and indexing all its daily news events. In this paper we study this part of Wikipedia and take a closer look into its content and the community behind it. First, we provide descriptive analysis of the collected news events. Second, we compare between the news summaries created by the WCEP crowd and the ones created by professional journalists on the same topics. Finally, we analyze the revision logs of news events over the past 7 years in order to characterize the WCEP crowd and their activities. The results show that WCEP has reached a stable state in terms of the volume of contributions as well as the size of its crowd, which makes it an important source of news summaries for the public and the research community.},

To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive longitudinal study of Reddit's evolution to date, studying both (i) how user submissions have evolved over time and (ii) how the community's allocation of attention and its perception of submissions have changed over 5 years based on an analysis of almost 60 million submissions. Our work reveals an ever-increasing diversification of topics accompanied by a simultaneous concentration towards a few selected domains both in terms of posted submissions as well as perception and attention. By and large, our investigations suggest that Reddit has transformed itself from a dedicated gateway to the Web to an increasingly self-referential community that focuses on and reinforces its own user-generated image- and textual content over external sources.},

We define a Web of Music in this paper to be a network of ``web-native music'', which we define in turn to be music that is published, shared, and remixed (has derivative works created) entirely on the web. Songrium was developed as an attempt to realize a Web of Music, by showing relations between both original songs and derivative works and offering an enriched listening experience. Songrium has analyzed over 600,000 music video clips on the most popular Japanese video-sharing service, Niconico, which contains original songs of web-native music and their derivative works such as covers and dance arrangements. Analysis of over 100,000 original songs reveals that over 500,000 derivative works were generated and have contributed to enrich the Web of Music.},

abstract = {YouTube is the world's largest video sharing platform where both professional and non-professional users participate in creating, uploading, and viewing content. In this work, we analyze content in the music category created by the non-professionals, which we refer to as user-generated content (UGC). Non-professional users frequently upload content (UGC) that are parodies, remakes, or covers of the music videos uploaded by professionals, namely the official record labels. Along with the success of official music videos on YouTube, we find the increased participation of users in creating the UGC related to the music videos. In this study, we characterize the UGC uploading behavior in terms of what, where, and when. Furthermore, we measure the relationship between the popularity of the original content and creation of the related UGC. We find that the UGC uploading behavior is different depending on the types of the UGC and across different genres of music videos. We also find that UGC sharing is a highly global activity; popular UGC is created from all over the world despite the fact that the popular music videos originate from a very limited number of locations. Our findings imply that utilizing the information on re-created UGC is important in order to understand and to predict the popularity of the original content.},

Neither Web search nor structured queries can effectively answer this type of queries, even when supported by Human Computation solutions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to answer memory queries that we call Transactive Search: The user-requested memory is reconstructed from a group of people by exchanging pieces of personal memories in order to reassemble the overall memory, which is stored in a distributed fashion among members of the group. We experimentally compare our proposed approach against a set of advanced search techniques including the use of Machine Learning methods over the Web of Data, online Social Networks, and Human Computation techniques. Experimental results show that Transactive Search significantly outperforms the effectiveness of existing search approaches for memory queries.},

These approaches make use of up-to-date data from initially unknown data sources and, thus, enable applications to tap the full potential of the Web. While existing work focuses primarily on implementation techniques, a principled analysis of subwebs that are reachable by such approaches is missing. Such an analysis may help to gain new insight into the problem of optimizing the response time of traversal-based query engines. Furthermore, a better understanding of characteristics of such subwebs may also inform approaches to benchmark these engines. This paper provides such an analysis. In particular, we identify typical graph-based properties of query-specific reachable subwebs and quantify their diversity. Furthermore, we investigate whether vertex scoring methods (e.g., PageRank) are able to predict query-relevance of data sources when applied to such subwebs.},

abstract = {The proliferation of mobile devices that are capable of estimating their position, has lead to the emergence of a new class of social networks, namely location-based social networks (LBSNs for short). The main interaction between users in an LBSN is location sharing. While the latter can be realized through continuous tracking of a user's whereabouts from the service provider, the majority of LBSNs allow users to voluntarily share their location, through  check-ins. LBSNs provide incentives to users to perform check-ins. However, these incentives can also lead to people faking their location, thus, generating false information. In this work, we propose the use of tensor decomposition for spotting anomalies in the check-in behavior of users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model this problem using tensor analysis.},

In this work we leverage data from a large online recipe platform which is frequently used in the German speaking regions in Europe and explore (i) the association between geographic proximity and shared food preferences and (ii) to what extent temporal information helps to predict the food preferences of users. Our results reveal that online food preferences of geographically closer regions are more similar than those of distant ones and show that specific types of ingredients are more popular on specific days of the week. The observed patterns can successfully be mapped to known real-world patterns which suggests that existing methods for the investigation of dietary and food patterns (e.g., consumer panels) may benefit from incorporating the vast amount of data generated by users browsing recipes on the Web.},

abstract = {User-generated content is a growing source of valuable information and its analysis can lead to a better understanding of the users needs and trends. In this paper, we leverage user feedback about YouTube videos for the task of affective video ranking. To this end, we follow a learning to rank approach, which allows us to compare the performance of different sets of features when the ranking task goes beyond mere relevance and requires an affective understanding of the videos. Our results show that, while basic video features, such as title and tags, lead to effective rankings in an affective-less setup, they do not perform as good when dealing with an affective ranking task.},

abstract = {In this poster, we propose WebAlive, a new paradigm that brings any Thing in the realm of reality to `life' on the Web by creating an entangled virtual existence for it. For example, consider a physical object like the lamp on your desk. As a human, you are aware of its existence. You can see it, touch it, feel it, interact with it (turn it on, o, etc.), investigate its attributes (color, material, etc.). You can even alter or trash it. Now, imagine that the lamp had a virtual counterpart on the Web such that the two of them were entangled with each other. A software agent on the Web can now become aware of its existence, it can perform actions on it, learn about its attributes and even (with the right capability) alter it just how it was accessible to you. Referring to the most broadest definition of the word Thing, we can extend this entanglement concept beyond physical things like devices, objects, people, etc. to all intelligible things like entities, processes, concepts, ideas, etc. By doing so, we can open a new realm of possibilities where we could have digital access to the world around us. This poster provides an introduction to the paradigm and presents an approach to realize it using Web standards.},

By experimenting with three large data sets containing diverse conflicts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of language-agnostic classification of ideological relation, achieving satisfactory results across all three data sets. Such a classifier potentially enables studies of diverse conflicts on Twitter on a large scale.},

The typical scenario includes a general purpose language (e.g. Ruby, Python, Java) used together with different specialized languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL. All the artifacts are connected via different types of relations, most of which depend on the adopted framework. These cross-language relations are normally not captured by tools which require the developer to learn and to remember those associations in order to understand and maintain the application. This paper describes a library for detecting cross-language relations in polyglot frameworks. The library has been developed to be modular and to be easily integrated in existing IDEs.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new voice web browser that can be operated in smart TV environments. Previous voice web browsers had the limitation of being run under limited conditions; for example, a list of the specific contents of a page was outputted by voice, or the user entered a search term by voice. In our method proposed in this paper, all the hierarchical menu areas on a web page are recognized and controlled with voice keywords so that page navigation according to a menu can be conveniently done in a voice supported web browser. Although many studies have been conducted on web page menu recognition, most of them provide insufficient information to recognize the hierarchical menu structure. In other words, most web pages in recent browsers showed submenus only as a result of a specific user interaction, since these previous studies had no way of recognizing or controlling the submenus. Therefore, in the web browser proposed in this study, a hierarchical menu structure, which is inserted dynamically via user interaction, is recognized and selected by voice, thus making it possible to maneuver on the web page. Furthermore, the core code of the browser is implemented in JavaScript, so it can be flexibly used not only for a web browser on Smart TVs, but also as functional extensions of existing web browsers in a PC environment.},

abstract = {Tracking the evolution of websites has become fundamental to the understanding of today's Internet. The automatic reasoning of how and why websites change has become essential to developers and businesses alike, in particular because the manual reasoning has become impractical due to the sheer number of modifications that websites undergo during their operational lifetime, including but not limited to rotating advertisements, personalized content, insertion of new content, or removal of old content. Prior work in the area of change detection, such as XyDiff, X-Diff or AT&amp;T's internet difference engine, focused mainly on ``diffing'' XML-encoded literary documents or XML-encoded databases. Only some previous work investigated the differences that must be taken into account to accurately extract the difference between HTML documents for which the markup language does not necessarily describe the content but is used to describe how the content is displayed instead. Additionally, prior work identifies all changes to a website, even those that might not be relevant to the overall analysis goal, in turn, they unnecessarily burden the analysis engine with additional workload.In this paper, we introduce a novel analysis framework, the Delta framework, that works by (i) extracting the modifications between two versions of the same website using a fuzzy tree difference algorithm, and (ii) using a machine-learning algorithm to derive a model of relevant website changes that can be used to cluster similar modifications to reduce the overall workload imposed on an analysis engine. Based on this model for example, the tracked content changes can be used to identify ongoing or even inactive web-based malware campaigns, or to automatically learn semantic translations of sentences or paragraphs by analyzing websites that are available in multiple languages.In prior work, we showed the effectiveness of the Delta framework by applying it to the detection and automatic identification of web-based malware campaigns on a data set of over 26 million pairs of websites that were crawled over a time span of four months. During this time, the system based on our framework successfully identified previously unknown web-based malware campaigns, such as a targeted campaign infecting installations of the Discuz!X Internet forum software.},

Indeed, together with monthly newsletters that can easily be ignored, inboxes contain flight itineraries, booking confirmations, receipts or invoices that are critical to many users. In this talk, I will discuss the new nature of consumer email, which is dominated by machine-generated messages of highly heterogeneous forms and value. I will show how the change has not been fully recognized yet by my most email clients (as an example, why should there still be a reply option associated with a message coming from a "do-not-reply@" address?). I will introduce some approaches for large-scale mail mining specifically tailored to machine-generated email. I will conclude by discussing possible applications and research directions.},

Clearly, the amount and the variety of user behavioral data which we can monitor at search engines is rapidly increasing. Still, we do not always recognize its potential to help us solve the most challenging search problems and do not immediately know the ways to deal with it most effectively both for search quality evaluation and for its improvement. My talk will focus on various practical challenges arising from the need to "grok" search engine users and do something useful with the data they most generously, though almost unconsciously share with us. I will also present some answers to that by overviewing our latest research on user model based retrieval quality evaluation, implicit feedback mining and personalization. I will also summarize the experience we gained from organizing three data mining challenges at the series of workshops on using search click data (WSCD) organized in the scope of WSDM 2012 -- 2014 conferences. These challenges provided a unique opportunity to consolidate and scrutinize the work from search engines' industrial labs on analyzing behavioral data. Each year we publicly shared a fully anonymized dataset extracted from Yandex query logs and asked participants to predict editorial relevance labels of documents using search logs (in 2011), detect search engine switchings in search sessions (in 2012) and personalize web search using the long-term (user history based) and short-term (session-based) user context (in 2013).},

abstract = {Cities are attracting considerable research interest. The agenda behind smart cities is popular among computer scientists and engineers: new monitoring technologies promise to allocate urban resources (e.g., electricity, clean water, car traffic) more efficiently and, as such, make our cities 'smarter'. This talk offers a rare counterpoint to that dominant efficiency-driven narrative. It is about recent research on the relationship between happiness and cities [1]: which urban elements make people happy? To help answer that question, I built a web game with collaborators at the University of Cambridge in which users are shown ten pairs of urban scenes of London and, for each pair, a user needs to choose which one they consider to be most beautiful, quiet, and happy. Based on user votes, we are able to rank all urban scenes according to these three attributes. We recently analyzed the scenes with ratings using image processing tools [2]. We discovered that the amount of greenery in any given scene is associated with all the three attributes and that cars and fortress-like buildings are associated with sadness (we equated sadness to our measurement for the low end of our 'spectrum' of happiness). In contrast, public gardens and Victorian and red brick houses are associated with happiness.Our results (including those about distinctive and memorable areas [3]) all point in the same direction: urban elements that hinder social interactions are undesirable, while elements that increase interactions are the ones that should be integrated by urban planners to retrofit our cities for happiness.Now, as a computer scientist, you might wonder: can these findings be used to build better online tools? The answer is a definite 'Yes'! Existing mapping technologies, for example, return shortest directions. To complement them, we are designing new tools that return directions that are not only short but also tend to make urban walkers happy [4]. Another application comes from the mobile world. In mobile settings, geo-referenced content becomes increasingly important, and content about a neighborhood inherently depends on the way the neighborhood is perceived by people: whether it is, for instance, distinctive and beautiful or not. We are designing an application that identifies memorable city pictures by predicting which neighborhoods tend to be beautiful and which tend to make people happy [5].},

Insight into these community dynamics could prove valuable for measuring content trust, providing role-based group recommendations, or evaluating group stability and growth. To this end, we explore user posting behavior on reddit, a large social networking site comprised of many sub-communities in which a user may participate simultaneously. We demonstrate that the well-known "answer-person" role is present in the reddit community, provide an exposition on an automated method for identifying this role based solely on user interactions (foregoing expensive content analysis), and show that users rarely exhibit significant participation in more than one communities.},

Using natural language processing, event information is extracted from content such as type of event, what entities are involved and in what role, sentiment and tone, and the occurrence time range of the event discussed. Statements made on Twitter about a future date from the time of posting prove particularly indicative. We consider in particular the case of the 2013 Egyptian coup d'\'{e}tat. The study validates and quantifies the common intuition that data on social media (beyond mainstream news sources) are able to predict major events.},

Furthermore, we show that the current tie strength is a good predictor for this link prediction task. In addition we show that the removal of weak ties improves the predictability for most of the considered network proximity measures. For our analysis we utilize three real-world datasets collected at different scientific conferences using the Conferator (http://www.conferator.org) system.},

abstract = {Social media has been considered as a data source for tracking disease. However, most analyses are based on models that prioritize strong correlation with population-level disease rates over determining whether or not specific individual users are actually sick. Taking a different approach, we develop a novel system for social-media based disease detection at the individual level using a sample of professionally diagnosed individuals. Specifically, we develop a system for making an accurate influenza diagnosis based on an individual's publicly available Twitter data. We find that about half (17/35 = 48.57%) of the users in our sample that were sick explicitly discuss their disease on Twitter. By developing a meta classifier that combines text analysis, anomaly detection, and social network analysis, we are able to diagnose an individual with greater than 99% accuracy even if she does not discuss her health.},

abstract = {Traditional public health surveillance systems would benefit from integration with knowledge created by new situation-aware realtime signals from social media, online searches, mobile/sensor networks and citizens' participatory surveillance systems. However, the challenge of threat validation, cross-verification and information integration for risk assessment has so far been largely untackled. In this paper, we propose a new system, medi+board, monitoring epidemic intelligence sources and traditional case-based surveillance to better automate early warning, cross-validation of signals for outbreak detection and visualization of results on an interactive dashboard. This enables public health professionals to see all essential information at a glance. Modular and configurable to any 'event' defined by public health experts, medi+board scans multiple data sources, detects changing patterns and uses a configurable analysis module for signal detection to identify a threat. These can be validated by an analysis module and correlated with other sources to assess the reliability of the event classified as the reliability coefficient which is a real number between zero and one. Events are reported and visualized on the medi+board dashboard which integrates all information sources and can be navigated by a timescale widget. Simulation with three datasets from the swine flu 2009 pandemic (HPA surveillance, Google news, Twitter) demonstrates the potential of medi+board to automate data processing and visualization to assist public health experts in decision making on control and response measures.},

Some of these communication channels are more structured, filtered and suited for evaluation, as a result they require less demanding filtration and analysis than others. One such channel is the Swedish National Telephone Health Service 1177, where professional healthcare personnel assist and give advice to callers. The main aim of this work is to detect point source outbreaks. For this purpose a project called Event-based Surveillance System (ESS) was initiated to develop a system for surveillance and detection using the former mentioned information source. The system is currently running and is used to notify local authorities whenever a deviation in the telephone traffic pattern is recorded.},

However, when a large-scale graph contains hundreds of millions of nodes/edges which cannot reside entirely in computer's main memory, measuring and maximizing group closeness become challenging tasks. In this paper, we present a systematic solution for efficiently calculating and maximizing the group closeness for disk-resident graphs. Our solution first leverages a probabilistic counting method to efficiently estimate the group closeness with high accuracy, rather than exhaustively computing it in an exact fashion. In addition, we design an I/O-efficient greedy algorithm to find a node group that maximizes group closeness. Our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of random accesses to disk, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency. Experiments on real-world big graphs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.},

abstract = {Preferential attachment (PA) models of network structure are widely used due to their explanatory power and conceptual simplicity. PA models are able to account for the scale-free degree distributions observed in many real-world large networks through the remarkably simple mechanism of sequentially introducing nodes that attach preferentially to high-degree nodes. The ability to efficiently generate instances from PA models is a key asset in understanding both the models themselves and the real networks that they represent. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the problem of efficient instance generation. In this paper, we show that the complexity of generating network instances from a PA model depends on the preference function of the model, provide efficient data structures that work under any preference function, and present empirical results from an implementation based on these data structures. We demonstrate that, by indexing growing networks with a simple augmented heap, we can implement a network generator which scales many orders of magnitude beyond existing capabilities (106 -- 108 nodes). We show the utility of an efficient and general PA network generator by investigating the consequences of varying the preference functions of an existing model. We also provide "quicknet", a freely-available open-source implementation of the methods described in this work.},

We present several reasonable neighbor selection schemes and evaluate their performance with a real dataset collected from Twitter. Unlike previous studies using network topology alone or synthetic parameters, we use real propagation rate for each node calculated from the Twitter messages during the 2010 UK election campaign. Our experimental results show that information can be efficiently propagated in online social networks using neighbors with a high propagation rate rather than those with a high number of neighbors.},

Based on complex network analysis and graph theory, this paper proposes a new framework to not only detect such courses, but also quantify their cruciality. The experimental results conducted using data from the University of New Mexico (UNM) show that the distribution of course cruciality follows a power law distribution. The results also show that the ten most crucial courses at UNM are all in mathematics. Applications of the proposed framework are extended to study the complexity of curricula within colleges, which leads to a consideration of the creation of optimal curricula. Optimal curricula along with the earned letter grades of the courses are further exploited to analyze the student progress. This work is important as it presents a robust framework to ensure the ease of flow of students through curricula with the goal of improving a university's graduation rate.},

We show that our method not only distinguishes between graphs with different degree distributions, but also different graphs with the same degree distributions. We compare the undirected power law graphs generated by Barabasi-Albert model and directed power law graphs generated by Krapivsky's model to the random graphs generated by Erdos-Renyi model. We also compare power law graphs generated by four different generative models with the same degree distribution.},

First, we make a malicious system call dictionary that consists of system calls found in malware. To analyze the general structural information of malware and measure the influence of system calls found in malware, we adopt social network analysis. Thus, we use social network metrics such as the degree distribution, degree centrality, and average distance, which are implicitly equivalent to distinct behavioral characteristics. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system performs well in classifying malware families within each malware class with accuracy greater than 98%. As exploiting the social network properties of system calls found in malware, our proposed method can not only classify the malware with fewer features than previous methods adopting graph features but also enables us to build a quick and simple detection system against malware.},

abstract = {Social media and blogging services have become extremely popular. Every day hundreds of millions of users share conversations on random thoughts, emotional expressions, political news, and social issues. Users interact by following each other's updates and passing along interesting pieces of information to their friends. Information therefore can diffuse widely and quickly through social links. Information propagation in networks like Twitter is unique in that traditional media sources and word-of-mouth propagation coexist. The availability of digitally-logged propagation events in social media help us better understand how user influence, tie strength, repeated exposures, conventions, and various other factors come into play in the way people generate and consume information in the modern society. In this talk, I will present several findings on how bad news [9], rumors [8], prominent events [11], conventions [6, 7], tags [1, 4], behaviors [12], and moods [10] propagate in social media based on a large amount of data collected from networks like Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, and Blogosphere. I will talk about the different roles of user types [2] and content types [5] in propagations as well as ways to measure their influence [3]. Among various findings, I will demonstrate that indegree of a user, a well-known measure of popularity, alone can reveal little about the influence.},

abstract = {Fake or misleading multimedia content and its distribution through social networks such as Twitter constitutes an increasingly important and challenging problem, especially in the context of emergencies and critical situations. In this paper, the aim is to explore the challenges involved in applying a computational verification framework to automatically classify tweets with unreliable media content as fake or real. We created a data corpus of tweets around big events focusing on the ones linking to images (fake or real) of which the reliability could be verified by independent online sources. Extracting content and user features for each tweet, we explored the fake prediction accuracy performance using each set of features separately and in combination. We considered three approaches for evaluating the performance of the classifier, ranging from the use of standard cross-validation, to independent groups of tweets and to cross-event training. The obtained results included a 81% for tweet features and 75% for user ones in the case of cross-validation. When using different events for training and testing, the accuracy is much lower (up to %58) demonstrating that the generalization of the predictor is a very challenging issue.},

To deal with the negative aspects, such as the spread of rumours and fake news, the flow of information should implicitly be filtered and marked to specific criteria such as credibility, trustworthiness, reputation, popularity, influence, and authenticity. This paper proposes an approach that can enhance trustworthiness and content validity in the presence of information overload. We introduce Alethiometer, a framework for assessing truthfulness in social media that can be used by professional and general news users alike. We present different measures that delve into the detailed analysis of the content, the contributors of the content and the underlying context. We further propose an approach for deriving a single metric that considers, in a unified manner, the quality of a contributor and of the content provided by that contributor. Finally, we present some preliminary statistical results from the examination of a set of 10 million twitter users, that provide useful insights on the characteristics of social media data.},

Studying such cross-population diffusion in various context helps us understand trends of information diffusion in a more accurate and consistent way. In this study, we focus on real-world news diffusion across online social systems such as mainstream news (News), social networking sites (SNS), and blogs (Blog), and we analyze behavioral patterns of the systems in terms of activity, reactivity, and heterogeneity. We found that News is the most active, SNS is the most reactive, and Blog is the most persistent, which governs time-evolving heterogeneity of these systems. Finally, we interpret the discovered crowd phenomena from various angles using our previous model-free and model-driven approaches, showing that the strength and directionality of influence reflect the behavioral patterns of the systems in news diffusion.},

Relying on subtitles to extract named entities that can be used to index fragments of a program is a common method. However, this approach is limited to what is being said in a program and written in a subtitle, therefore lacking a broader context. Furthermore, this type of index is restricted to a flat list of entities. In this paper, we combine the power of non-structured documents with structured data coming from DBpedia to generate a much richer, context aware metadata of a TV program. We demonstrate that we can harvest a rich context by expanding an initial set of named entities detected in a TV fragment. We evaluate our approach on a TV news show.},

abstract = {Community-based recommender systems have attracted much research attention. Forming communities allows us to reduce data sparsity and focus on discovering the latent characteristics of communities instead of individuals. Previous work focused on how to detect the community using various algorithms. However, they failed to consider users' social attributes, such as social activeness and dynamic interest, which have strong correlations to users' preference and choice. Intuitively, people have different social activeness in a social network. Ratings from users with high activeness are more likely to be trustworthy. Temporal dynamic of interest is also significant to user's preference. In this paper, we propose a novel community-based framework. We first employ PLSA-based model incorporating social activeness and dynamic interest to discover communities. Then the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method is applied on each of the communities. The experiment results on two real world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method for improving recommendation performance.},

By critiquing a product, the user gives an informative feedback(i.e, which feature needs to be modified) about why they rejected a product and preferred the other one. As a user interacts with such a system, trails are left behind. We propose ways of leveraging these trails to induce preference models of items which can be used to estimate the relative utilities of products which can be used in ranking the recommendations presented to the user. The idea is to effectively complement knowledge of explicit user interactions in traditional social recommenders with knowledge implicitly obtained from trails.},

Our proposed algorithm recommends scholarly papers, issued by Active Participants (APs), to other Group Profile participants at the same smart conference based on similarity of their research interests. Furthermore, through computation of social ties, SARSP generates effective recommendations of scholarly papers to participants who have strong social ties with an AP. Through a relevant real-world dataset, we evaluate our proposed algorithm. Our experimental results verify that SARSP has encouraging improvements over other existing methods.},

Amazon alone provides access to millions of reviews, risking to cause information overload to an average user. Recent research has thus aimed at understanding and identifying reviews that are considered helpful. Most of such works analyzed the structure and connectivity of social networks to identify influential users. We believe that insight about influence can be gained from analyzing the affective content of the text as well as affect intensity. We employ text mining to extract the emotionality of 68,049 hotel reviews in order to investigate how those influencers behave, especially their choice of words. We analyze whether texts with words and phrases indicative of a writer's emotions, moods, and attitudes are more likely to trigger a genuine interest compared to more neutral texts. Our initial hypothesis was that influential writers are more likely to refrain themselves from expressing their sentiments in order to achieve a more perceived objectivity. But contrary to this initial assumption, our study shows that they use more affective words, both in terms of emotion variety and intensity. This work describes the first step towards building a helpfulness prediction algorithm using emotion lexicons.},

In our experiments we include methods proposed by Fouss et al. and Gori and Pucci, method P3, which is based on the distribution of the random walk after three steps, and method P3a, which generalises P3. We show that the simple method P3 can outperform previous methods and method P3a can offer further improvements. We show that the time- and memory-efficiency of direct simulation of random walks allows application of these methods to large datasets. We use in our experiments the three MovieLens datasets.},

abstract = {Recent research has unveiled the importance of online social networks for improving the quality of recommenders in several domains, what has encouraged the research community to investigate ways to better exploit the social information for recommendations. However, there is a lack of work that offers details of frameworks that allow an easy integration of social data with traditional recommendation algorithms in order to yield a straight-forward and scalable implementation of new and existing systems. Furthermore, it is rare to find details of performance evaluations of recommender systems such as hardware and software specifications or benchmarking results of server loading tests. In this paper we intend to bridge this gap by presenting the details of a social recommender engine for online marketplaces built upon the well-known search engine Apache Solr. We describe our architecture and also share implementation details to facilitate the re-use of our approach by people implementing recommender systems. In addition, we evaluate our framework from two perspectives: (a) recommendation algorithms and data sources, and (b) system performance under server stress tests. Using a dataset from the SecondLife virtual world that has both trading and social interactions, we contribute to research in social recommenders by showing how certain social features allow to improve recommendations in online marketplaces. On the platform implementation side, our evaluation results can serve as a baseline to people searching for performance references in terms of scalability, model training and testing trade-offs, real-time server performance and the impact of model updates in a production system.},

abstract = {The Web has involved diverse media services, such as blogs, photo/video/link sharing, social networks, and microblogs. These Web media react to and affect realworld events, while the mass media still has big influence on social activities.The Web and mass media now affect each other. Our use of media has evolved dynamically in the last decade, and this affects our societal behavior. For instance, the first photo of a plane crash landing during the "Miracle on the Hudson" on January 15, 2009 appeared and spread on Twitter and was then used in TV news. During the "Chelyabinsk Meteor" incident on February 15, 2013, many people reported videos of the incident on YouTube then mass media reused them on TV programs.Large scale collection, analysis, and visualization of those multiple media are strongly required for sociology, linguistics, risk management, and marketing researches. We are building a huge scale Japanese web archive, and various analytics engines with a large-scale display wall. Our archive consists of 30 billion web pages crawled for 14 years, 1 billion blog posts for 7 years, and 15 billion tweets for 3 years.In this talk, I present several analysis and visualization systems based on network analysis, natural language processing, image processing, and 3 dimensional visualization.},

For instance, rescue teams and insurance companies are interested in concise facts about damages after disasters, which can be found in web blogs, newspaper articles, social networks etc. However, finding, extracting, and condensing specific facts is a highly complex undertaking: It requires identifying appropriate textual sources, recognizing relevant facts within the sources, and aggregating extracted facts into a condensed answer despite inconsistencies, uncertainty, and changes over time. In this paper, we present a three-step framework providing techniques and solutions for each of these problems. We tested the feasibility of extracting time-associated event facts using our framework in a comprehensive case study: gathering data on particular earthquakes from web data sources. Our results show that it is, under certain circumstances, possible to automatically obtain reliable and timely data on natural disasters from the web.},

We present Warcbase, an open-source platform for managing web archives built on the distributed datastore HBase. Our system provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing. Relying on HBase for storage infrastructure simplifies the development of scalable and responsive applications. We describe a service that provides temporal browsing and an interactive visualization based on topic models that allows users to explore archived content.},

Interaction models can be used to choreograph distributed systems, providing points of coordination and communication between multiple interacting actors. While existing social networks specify how interactions happen---who messages go to and when, the effects of carrying out actions---these are typically implicit, opaque and non user-editable. Treating interaction models as first class objects allows the creation of electronic institutions, on which users can then choose the kinds of interaction they wish to engage in, with protocols which are explicit, visible and modifiable. However, there is typically a cost to users to engage with these institutions. In this paper we introduce the notion of "shadow institutions", where actions on existing social networks are mapped onto formal interaction protocols, allowing participants access to computational intelligence in a seamless, zero-cost manner to carry out computation and store information.},

We argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding participants in a more granular way is crucial for social machine observation and design. We present the results of a study of the personas portrayed by participants in a social machine that produces creative media content, and discover that inconsistent or misleading representations of individuals do not necessarily undermine the system in which they are participating.

abstract = {Although Social Machines do not have yet a formalized definition, some efforts have been made to characterize them from a ``machinery'' point of view. In this paper, we present a methodology by which we attempt to reveal the sociality of Social Machines; to do so, we adopt the analogy of stories. By assimilating a Social Machine to a story, we can identify the stories within and about that machine and how this storytelling perspective might reveal the sociality of Social Machines. After illustrating this storytelling approach with a few examples, we then propose three axes of inquiry to evaluate the health of a social machine: (1) assessment of the sociality of a Social Machine through evaluation of its storytelling potential and realization; (2) assessment of the sustainability of a Social Machine through evaluation of its reactivity and interactivity; and (3) assessment of emergence through evaluation of the collaboration between authors and of the distributed/mixed nature of authority.},

Diversity of crawled content is one of the crucial aspects of a domain-specific search engine. To a large extent, diversity is governed by the initial set of seed URLs. Most of the existing approaches rely on manual effort for seed selection. In this work we automate this process using URLs posted on Twitter. We propose an algorithm to get a set of diverse seed URLs from a Twitter URL graph. We compare the performance of our approach against the baseline zero similarity seed selection method and find that our approach beats the baseline by a significant margin.},

Hypermedia-based APIs bring theoretical advantages over many other designs, including the possibility of self-updating, generic API client software. Such hypermedia API clients only lately have come to exist, and the existing hypermedia client space did not compare favorably to custom API client libraries, requiring somewhat tedious manual access to HTTP resources. Nonetheless, the limitations in creating a compelling hypermedia client were few.This paper describes the design and implementation of HyperResource, a fully generic, production-ready Ruby client library for hypermedia APIs. The project leverages the inherent practicality of hypermedia design, demonstrates its immediate usefulness in creating self-generating API clients, enumerates several abstractions and strategies that help in creating hypermedia APIs and clients, and promotes hypermedia API design as the easiest option available to an API programmer.},

abstract = {In today's Web-centric era, embedded systems become mashup various web services via RESTful web services. RESTful web services use REST APIs that describe actions as resource state transfers via standard HTTP methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. While RESTful web services are lightweight and executable on any platforms that support HTTP methods, writing programs composed of only such primitive methods is not a familiar concept to developers. Therefore, no single design strategy for (fully) RESTful APIs works for arbitrary domains, and current REST APIs are system dependent, incomplete, and likely to change. To help sever-side development of REST APIs, several domain-specific languages such as WADL, WSDL 2.0, and RDF provide automatic tools to generate REST APIs. However, client-side developers who often do not know the web services domain and do not understand RESTful web services suffer from the lack of any development help. In this paper, we present a new approach to build JavaScript APIs that are more accessible to client-side developers than REST APIs. We show a case study of our approach that uses JavaScript APIs and their wrapper implementation instead of REST APIs, and we describe the efficiency in the client-side development.},

However, no guarantees can be made for more complex interactions which require to atomically transfer state among resources distributed across multiple servers. In this paper we describe a lightweight design for transactional composition of RESTful services. The approach -- based on the Try-Cancel/Confirm (TCC) pattern -- does not require any extension to the HTTP protocol. The design assumes that resources are designed to comply with the TCC pattern and ensures that the resources involved in the transaction are not aware of it. It delegates the responsibility of achieving the atomicity of the transaction to a coordinator which exposes a RESTful API.},

In recent years, RESTful services are gaining traction in the industry and are commonly used as a simpler alternative to SOAP Web Services. However, one of the main drawbacks of RESTful services is the lack of standard mechanisms to support advanced quality-of-service requirements that are common to enterprises. Transaction processing is one of the essential features of enterprise information systems and several transaction models have been proposed in the past years to fulfill the gap of transaction processing in RESTful services. The goal of this paper is to analyze the state-of-the-art RESTful transaction models and identify the current challenges.},

abstract = {Many organisations publish their data through a Web API. This stimulates use by Web applications, enabling reuse and enrichments. Recently, resource-oriented APIs are increasing in popularity because of their scalability. However, for organisations subject to data archiving, creating such an APIraises certain issues. Often, datasets are stored in different files and different formats. Therefore, tracking revisions is a challenging task and the API has to be custom built. Moreover, standard APIs only provide access to the current state of a resource. This creates time-based inconsistencies when they are combined. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end solution for publishing a dataset as a time-based versioned REST API, with minimal input of the publisher. Furthermore, it publishes the provenance of each created resource. We propose a technology stack composed of prior work, which versions datasets, generates provenance, creates an API and adds Memento Datetime negotiation.},

At the same time, they need to efficiently and effectively exploit services available over the Web. Arguing that dealing with data-intensive and cognitively complex settings is not a technical problem alone, this paper presents a novel collaboration support platform for Web communities. The proposed solution adopts a hybrid approach that builds on the synergy between machine and human intelligence to facilitate the underlying sense-making and decision making processes. User experience shows that the platform enables stakeholders to make better, more informed and quicker decisions. The functionalities of the proposed platform are described through a real-world case from a biomedical research community.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel framework for representing community 'know-how' on the Semantic Web. Procedural knowledge generated by web communities typically takes the form of natural language instructions or videos and is largely unstructured. The absence of semantic structure impedes the deployment of many useful applications, in particular the ability to discover and integrate know-how automatically. We discuss the characteristics of community know-how and argue that existing knowledge representation frameworks fail to represent it adequately. We present a novel framework for representing the semantic structure of community know-how and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by providing a concrete implementation which includes a method for automatically acquiring procedural knowledge for real-world tasks.},

abstract = {People-to-people interactions in the real world and in virtual environments (e.g., Facebook) can be represented through complex networks. Changes of the structural properties of these complex networks are caused through a variety of dynamic processes. While accepting the fact that variability in individual patterns of behavior (i.e., establishment of random or FOAF-type potential links) in social environments might lead to an increase or decrease in the structural properties of a complex network, in this paper, we focus on another factor that may contribute to such changes, namely the size of personal networks. Any personal network comes with the cost of maintaining individual connections. Despite the fact that technology has shrunk our world, there is also a limit to how many close friends one can keep and count on. It is a relatively small number. In this paper, we develop a multi-agent based model to capture, compare, and explain the structural changes within a growing social network (e.g., expanding the social relations beyond one's social circles). We aim to show that, in addition to various dynamic processes of human interactions, limitations on the size of personal networks can also lead to changes in the structural properties of networks (i.e., the average shortest-path length). Our simulation result shows that the famous small world theory of interconnectivity holds true or even can be shrunk, if people manage to utilize all their existing connections to reach other parties. In addition to this, it can clearly be observed that the network's average path length has a significantly smaller value, if the size of personal networks is set to larger values in our network growth model. Therefore, limitations on the size of personal networks in network growth models lead to an increase in the network's average path length.},

abstract = {With the emergence of social networks and their potential impact on society, many research groups and originations are collecting huge amount of social media data from various sites to serve different applications. These systems offer insights on different facets of society at different moments of time. Collectively they are known as social observatory systems. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a live social observatory system named 'NExT-Live'. It aims to analyze the live online social media data streams to mine social senses, phenomena, influences and geographical trends dynamically. It incorporates an efficient and robust set of crawlers to continually crawl online social interactions on various social network sites. The data crawled are stored and processed in a distributed Hadoop architecture. It then performs the analysis on these social media streams jointly to generate analytics at different levels. In particular, it generates high-level analytics about the sense of different target entitles, including People, Locations, Topics and Organizations. NExT-Live offers a live observatory platform that enables people to know the happenings of the place in order to lead better life.},

The HistoryTracker tool serves to create a Web observatory that allows scholars to study the history of the Web. HistoryTracker takes advantages of Hadoop processing capacity, and allows researchers to extract large swaths of archived data into a link list format that can be easily transferred to a number of other analytical tools. A brief illustration of the use of HistoryTracker is presented demonstrating the use of the tool. Finally, a number of continuing research challenges are discussed, and future research opportunities are outlined.},

abstract = {A salient dynamic property of social media is bursting be- havior. In this paper, we study bursting behavior in relation to the structure of fluctuation, known as fluctuation-response relation, to reveal the origin of bursts. More specifically, we study the temporal relation between a preceding baseline fluctuation and the successive burst response using a frequency time series of 3,000 keywords on Twitter. We find three types of keyword time series in terms of the fluctuation-response relation. For the first type of keyword, the baseline fluctuation has a positive correlation with the burst size; as the preceding fluctuation increases, the burst size increases. These bursts are caused endogenously as a result of word-of-mouth interactions in a social network; the keyword is sensitive only to the internal context of the system. For the second type, there is a critical threshold in the fluctuation value up to which a positive correlation is observed. Beyond this value, the size of the bursts becomes independent from the fluctuation size. Our analysis shows that this critical threshold emerges because the bursts in the time series are endogenous and exogenous. This type of keyword is sensitive to internal and external stimuli. The third type is mainly bursts caused by exogenous bursts. This type of keyword is mostly sensitive only to external stimuli. These results are useful for characterizing how excitable a keyword is on Twitter and could be used, for example, for marketing purposes.},

Recordable events associated with interactivity on the Web provide an opportunity to openly evaluate the utility of these artefacts, assessing fitness for purpose and observing their use. The three principles presented in this paper propose a community evaluation approach to innovation in visual analytics and visualisation for Web Observatories through code sharing, the capturing of semantically enriched interaction data and by openly stating the intended goals of all visualisation work. The potential of this approach is exampled with a set of front-end tools suitable for adoption by the majority of Web Observatories as a means of visualising data on the Web as part the shared, open, and community-driven developmental process. The paper outlines the method for capturing user interaction data as a series of semantic events, which can be used to identify improvements in both the structure and functionality of visualisations. Such refinements in user behaviour are proposed as part of a new methodology that introduces Economics as an evaluation tool for visual analytics.},

In the presence of adaptive link annotation, students tend to access significantly more learning content; they stay with it longer, return to it more often and explore a wider variety of learning resources. This talk will present an overview of our exploration of the addictive links effect in many course-long studies, which we ran in several domains (C, SQL and Java programming), for several types of learning content (quizzes, problems, interactive examples).

abstract = {The main objectives of massive open online courses (MOOC) are to foster knowledge through free high quality learning materials procurement; to create new knowledge through diverse users' interactions with the providing platform; and to empower research on learning. However, MOOC providers are also businesses (either profit or not-for-profit). They are still in the early stages of their development, but sooner or later, in order to secure their existence and assure their longterm growth, they will have to adapt a business model and monetize the services they provide. Nevertheless, despite their popularity MOOCs are characterized by a very high drop-out rate (about 90%), which may turn out to be a problem regardless of the adapted business model. Hence, MOOC providers can either assume the scale benefits to be sufficiently high to ignore the problem of low MOOC completion rate or tackle this problem. In this paper we explore the problem of the high drop-out rate in massive open online courses. First, we identify its main cause by conducting an online survey, namely bad time organization. Secondly, we provide suggestions to reduce the rate. Specifically, we argue that MOOC platforms should not only provide their users with high quality educational materials and interaction facilities. But they should also support and assist the users in their quest for knowledge. Thus, MOOC platforms should provide tools helping them optimize their time usage and subsequently develop metacognitive skills indispensable in proper time management of learning processes.},

As each of them mostly concentrates on addressing a specific issue, people need a one-stop platform, which could integrate multiply functions. In addition, with the supported concept of e-learning ecosystem for future education, a comprehensive platform will be more promising. Therefore, we introduce VeriGuide Platform, which provides a professional writing toolbox to promote the enhancement of teaching and learning in writing. It contains six vertical components, which could be split into two groups. The first group, Editing Assistance, facilitates students write papers and point out grammar and spelling errors. While the second group, Text Analysis, offers document analysis results, which enables students to achieve further writing improvement with explanatory feedbacks.

abstract = {The way people create and share content has radically changed in the past few years thanks to the advent of social networks, web communities, blogs, wikis, and other online collaborative media. Such online social data are continuously growing in a way that makes it difficult to efficiently aggregate them, since they are the expression of a multitude of single content creators that most of the times show only a small percentage of originality. The act of 'sharing' is still tied to a pre-Internet fashion that sees it as a step following (and never preceding) content creation, as enforced by the rules of publishing and copyright. In the Internet era, the pieces of the puzzle of a valuable work might be scattered throughout the whole Web. In order to hinder the obsolete create-then-share trend that is killing creativity and usefulness of the Web, we propose a novel concept of copyright, which allows content to be shared while being created, in a way that they can gain increasing value as they become part of an increasingly richer puzzle.},

We concentrated on psychological factors that lead to the characteristic positive bias observed in many working social feedback systems on the Internet. We have used International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and measured the following traits: trust, conformity, risk taking, need for cognition and intellect. Results suggest that trustworthiness and risk taking are factors clearly differentiating people with respect to tendency to overestimate, underestimate and judge accordingly websites' credibility. Intuitively people characterized by high general trust tend to be more generous in their credibility evaluations. On the other hand, people who are more willing to take risk, tend to be more critical of the Internet content. The latter indicates that high credibility evaluations are being treated as a default option, and lower ratings require special conditions. Other, more detailed psychological patterns related to websites' credibility evaluations are described in full paper.},

Because every web resource has its own characteristics, the tag types of each web resource are different. According to the web resource, the quality of each tag type is different. We should depend on resource types to evaluate the quality of tag types, in order to provide efficient tag recommendation service and design better user tagging interfaces. In this paper, we firstly selected five web resources, namely the blog, book, image, music and video, to explore the tag types when annotating different resources. Then we chose specific resource and tags to explore the quality of each tag type according to these five web resources and study the relationship between tag type and quality. The conclusion is that the quality of tag types for different web resources is different.},

We demonstrate that this approach can be substantially improved in two ways: by applying machine learning methods to vectors computed, using psychosocial and psycholinguistic features and in a high-dimensional bag-of-words paradigm of word occurrences. Following Olteanu et al., we test the methods in two classification settings, as a 2-class and 3-class scenario, and in a regression setting. In the 3-class scenario, the features compiled by Olteanu et al. achieve weighted precision of 0.63, while the methods proposed in our paper raise it to 0.66 and 0.70. We also examine coefficients of the models in order to discover words associated with low and high trust.},

abstract = {From social networks to language modeling, the growing scale and importance of graph data has driven the development of new graph-parallel systems. In this talk, I will review the graph-parallel abstraction and describe how it can be used to express important machine learning and graph analytics algorithms like PageRank and Latent factor models. I will present how systems like GraphLab and Pregel exploit restrictions in the graph-parallel abstraction along with advances in distributed graph representation to efficiently execute iterative graph algorithms orders of magnitude faster than more general data-parallel systems. Unfortunately, the same restrictions that enable graph-parallel systems to achieve substantial performance gains also limit their ability to express many of the important stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline. As a consequence, existing approaches to graph-analytics typically compose multiple systems through brittle and costly file interfaces. To fill the need for a holistic approach to graph-analytics we introduce GraphX, which unifies graph-parallel and data-parallel computation under a single API and system. I will show how a simple set of data-parallel operators can be used to express graph-parallel computation and how, by applying a collection of query optimizations derived from our work on graph-parallel systems, we can execute entire graph-analytics pipelines efficiently in a more general data-parallel distributed fault-tolerant system achieving performance comparable to specialized state-of-the-art systems.},

In addition, we propose a cost-driven decision framework where the learner chooses to query either the labels or the missing attributes. This problem statement addresses a common constraint when building large datasets and applying active learning techniques on them, where some of the attributes (including the labels) are significantly harder or more costly to acquire per data point. We take a novel approach to this problem, first by building an imputation model that maps from the partially featured data to the fully featured dimension, and then performing active learning on the projected input space combined with the estimated confidence of inference. We discuss that our approach is flexible and can work with graph mining tasks as well as conventional semi-supervised learning problems. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm facilitates more cost-efficient annotation than the baselines.},

The challenges of detecting community for big graphs include high computational cost, no prior information, etc.. In this work, we analyze the process of random walking in graphs, and find out that the weight of an edge gotten by processing the vertices visited by the walker could be an indicator to measure the closeness of vertex connection. Based on this idea, we propose a community detection algorithm for undirected big graphs which consists of three steps, including random walking using a single walker, weight calculating for edges and community detecting. Our algorithm is running in O(n2) without prior information. Experimental results show that our algorithm is capable of detecting the community structure and the overlapping parts of graphs in real-world effectively, and handling the challenges of community detection in big graph era.},

Firstly, we propose a new greedy method for the influence maximization problem using the 2-hop influence spread. Secondly, to speed up the new greedy method, we devise an effective way of removing unnecessary nodes for influence maximization based on optimal seed's local influence heuristics. In our experiments, we evaluate our method with real-life datasets, and compare it with recent existing methods. From experimental results, the proposed method is at least an order of magnitude faster than the existing methods in all cases while achieving similar accuracy.},

Exemplar questions we aim to answer include (a) what makes a team more successful than others, and how to find the best replacement if one of its team members becomes unavailable? (b) how to find a group of authors from databases, data mining and bioinformatics and they collaborate with each other in a star-shape? (c) given a set of querying authors of interest, how to find somebody who initiates the research field these querying authors belong to, and how to summarize and visualize the querying authors' (d) how to incorporate users' preference into these complex queries' We will also introduce the computational challenges behind these querying tools and how to remedy them.},

Using tools from the field of Game Theory, we study researchers' collaborative behavior over time under this model, with the premise that each researcher wants to maximize his or her academic success. We find analytically that there is a strong incentive to collaborate rather than work in isolation, and that studying collaborative behavior through a game-theoretic lens is a promising approach to help us better understand the nature and dynamics of academic collaboration.},

abstract = {This paper reports the preliminary results of a project that aims at incorporating the analysis of the web presence (content) of research institutions into the scientometric analysis of these research institutions. The problem is to understand and predict the dynamics of academic activity and resource allocation using web presence. The present paper approaches this problem in two parts. First we develop a crawler and an archive of the web contents obtained from academic institutions, and present an early analysis of the records. Second, we use (currently off-line records to analyze the dynamics of resource allocation. Combination of the two parts is an ambition of ongoing work. The motivation in this study is twofold. First, we strongly believe that independent archiving, indexing and searching of (past) web content is an important task, even with regards to academic web presence. We are particularly interested in studying the dynamics of the "online scientific discourse", based on the assumption that the changing traces of web presence is an important factor that documents the intensity of activity. Second, we maintain that the trend-analysis of scientific activity represents a hitherto unused potential. We illustrate this by a pilot where, using 'offline' longitudinal datasets, we study whether past (i.e. cumulative) success can predict current (and future) activity in academia. Or, in short: do institutions invest and publish in areas where they have been successful? Answer to this question is, we believe, important to understanding and predicting research policies and their changes.},

We use ontologies to incorporate semantics to detect conflicts and resolve inconsistencies, and to infer new relations or proof statements with a reasoning engine. We consider a semantic web subject to changes in the knowledge base, the underlying ontology or the rule set that governs the reasoning. In this paper we explore the idea of trust where each change to the knowledge base is analyzed as to what subset of the knowledge base can still be trusted. We present algorithms that adapt the reasoner such that, when proving a goal, it does a simple retrieval when it encounters trusted items and backward chaining over untrusted items. We provide an evaluation of our proposed modifications that show that our algorithm is conservative and that it provides significant gains in performance for certain queries.},

abstract = {With the rapid increase of research papers, article-level metrics are of growing importance for helping researchers select papers. Classical metrics have a significant drawback of just using single factor, which limits the effectiveness of assessing papers in different periods after publication. Moreover, with the development of web 2.0, some new factors are introduced to assess papers. So, a novel article level metric in the context of research community (ALM_RC) is proposed. It integrates the impact of different factors comprehensively, because different factors have different time features and can complement each other in different periods after publication. In addition, as a research community is based on certain research directions, it is a relatively stable environment with related journals and scholars contributing their efforts to development of this research field. So in the context of research community, it is consistent, practical and reasonable to calculate the impact of the journals and scholars under relatively fair criteria. Experimental results show the novel metric is effective and robust in assessing papers.},

We use this model to build a platform that connects scholars, using their profiles as a starting point to explore novel and relevant content for their research. Scholars can easily adapt to evolving trends by synchronizing new social media accounts or collaboration tools and integrate then with new datasets. We evaluate our approach by a scenario of personalized exploration of research repositories where we analyze real world scholar profiles and compare them to a reference profile.},

abstract = {Recent academic procedures have depicted that work involving scientific research tends to be more prolific through collaboration and cooperation among researchers and research groups. On the other hand, discovering new collaborators who are smart enough to conduct joint-research work is accompanied with both difficulties and opportunities. One notable difficulty as well as opportunity is the big scholarly data. In this paper, we satisfy the demand of collaboration recommendation through co-authorship in an academic network. We propose a random walk model using three academic metrics as basics for recommending new collaborations. Each metric is studied through mutual paper co-authoring information and serves to compute the link importance such that a random walker is more likely to visit the valuable nodes. Our experiments on DBLP dataset show that our approach can improve the precision, recall rate and coverage rate of recommendation, compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, we address an interesting problem that has not been adequately studied so far: mining cumulated large scale scholarly data to find comparable researchers.We propose a standard to quantify the quality of individual's research output, through the quality of publishing venues. We represent a researcher as a sequence of her publication records, and develop methods to compute the distance between two researchers through sequence matching. Multiple variations of distances are considered to target different scenarios. We define comparable relation by the distance, and conduct experiments on a large corpus and demonstrate the effectiveness our methods through examples. In the end of the paper, we identify several promising directions for further work.},

By incorporating data from both road traffic monitoring system and online information, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian network to predict road traffic condition. Using historical data, we establish a hierarchical Bayesian network to characterize the relationships among events and road traffic conditions. To evaluate the model, we use the traffic data collected in Western Massachusetts as well as online information about events and weather.

abstract = {For the last few years, I and my colleagues have been exploring the complex relationship between our offline and online worlds. This talk will show that, as online platforms become mature, the social behavior we have evolved over thousands of years is reflected on our actions on the web as well. It turns out that, in the context of social influence, finding the "(special) many" (of those who are able to spot trends early one) is more important than trying to find the "special few"[10]; that people with different personality traits take on different roles on both Twitter and Facebook [5,6]; that language, with its vocabulary and prescribed ways of communicating, is a symbolic resource that can be used on its own to influence others [4]; and that a Facebook relationship is more likely to break if it is not embedded in the same social circle, if it is between two people whose ages differ, and if one of the two is neurotic or introvert [3]. Interestingly, we also found that a relationship with a common female friend is more robust than that with a common male friend. More recently, we have also explored the relationship between offline and online worlds in the urban context. We have considered hypotheses put forward in the 1970s urban sociology literature [1,2] and, for the first time, we have been able to test them at scale.We have done so by building two crowdsourcing web games: one crowdsources Londoners' mental images of the city [8], and the other crowdsources the discovery of the urban elements that make people happy [7]. We have found that, as opposed to well-to-do areas, those suffering from social problems are rarely present in residents' mental maps of the city, and they tend to be characterized more by cars and fortress-like buildings than by greenery. This talk will conclude by showing how combining both web games with Flickr offers interesting applications for discovering emotionally-pleasant routes [9] and for ranking city pictures [11].},

abstract = {With the remarkable advances from isolated console games to massively multi-player online role-playing games, the online gaming world provides yet another place where people interact with each other. Online games have attracted attention from researchers, because i) the purpose of actions is relatively clear, and ii) actions are quantifiable. A wide range of predefined actions for supporting social interaction (e.g., friendship, communication, trade, enmity, aggression, and punishment) reflects either positive or negative connotations among game players, and is unobtrusively recorded by the game servers. These rich electronic footprints have become invaluable assets for the research of social dynamics.In particular, exploring negative behavior in online games is a key research direction because it directly influences gaming experience and user satisfaction. Even a few negative players can impact many others because of the design of multi-player games. For this reason these players are called toxic. The definition of toxic play is not cut and dry. Even if someone follows the game rules, he could be considered toxic. For example, killing one player repetitively is often deemed toxic behavior, although it does not break game rules at all. The vagueness of toxicity makes it hard to understand, detect, and prevent it.League of Legends (LoL), created by Riot Games with 70 million users as of 2012, offers a new way to understand toxic behavior. Riot Games develops a crowdsourcing framework, the Tribunal, to judge whether reported toxic behavior should be punished or not. Volunteered players review user reports and vote for either pardon or punishment. As of March 2013, 105 million votes had been collected in North America and Europe.We explore toxic playing and reaction based on large-scale data from the Tribunal[1]. We collect and investigate over 10 million user reports on 1.46 million toxic players and corresponding crowdsourced decisions made in the Tribunal. We crawl data from three different regions, North America, Western Europe, and Korea, to take regional differences of user behavior into account. To obtain the comprehensive view of toxic playing and reaction based on huge data collection, we answer following research questions in a bottom-up approach: how individuals react to toxic players, how teams interact with toxic players, how general toxic or non-toxic players behave across the match, and how crowds make a decision on toxic players. We find large-scale empirical support for some notoriously difficult theories to test in the wild, which are bystander effect, ingroup favoritism, black sheep effect, cohesion-performance relationships, and attribution theory. We also discover that regional differences affect the likelihood of being reported and the proportion of being punished of toxic players in the Tribunal.We then propose a supervised learning approach for predicting crowdsourced decisions on toxic behavior with large-scale labeled data collections[2]. Using the same sparse information available to the reviewers, we trained classifiers to detect the presence, and severity of toxicity. We built several models oriented around in-game performance, reports by victims of toxic behavior, and linguistic features of chat messages. We found that training with high agreement decisions resulted in more accuracy on low agreement decisions and that our classifier was adept in detecting clear cut innocence. Finally, we showed that our classifier is relatively robust across cultural regions; our classifier built from a North American dataset performed adequately on a European dataset.Ultimately, our work can be used as a foundation for the further study of toxic behavior.},

Unfortunately, users have limited attention to spare for interacting with online sites. Hence, it is of utmost importance to design sites that attract user attention and effectively guide users to the product or content items they like. Thus, we propose a novel and scalable experimentation approach to evaluate the effectiveness of online site designs. Our case study focuses on the effects of an authority message on visitors' browsing behavior on workshop and seminar online announcement sites. An authority message emphasizes a particular prominent speaker and his/her achievements. Through dividing users into control and treatment groups and carefully tracking their online activities, we observe that the authority message influences the way users interact with page elements on the website and increases their interests in the authority speakers.},

A lot of work has been developed to find useful information from these data, and various approaches have been proposed. In this work, we aim to use one specific type of locational data -- network connection logs of mobile devices, which is widely available and easily accessible to telecom companies, to identify and extract active areas of users. This is a challenging topic due to the existence of inaccurate location and fluctuating log time intervals of this kind of data. In order to observe user behavior from this kind of data set, we propose a new algorithm, namely Behavior Observation Tool (BOT), which uses Convex Hull Algorithm with sliding time windows to model the user's movement, and thus knowledge about the user's lifestyle and habits can extracted from the mobile device network logs.},

For example, email communications between users may be represented explicitly in a network, while managerial relationships may not. In this paper we focus on analyzing explicit interactions among actors in order to detect hierarchical social relationships that may be implicit. We start by employing three well-known ranking-based methods, PageRank, Degree Centrality, and Rooted-PageRank (RPR) to infer such implicit relationships from interactions between actors. Then we propose two novel approaches which take into account the time-dimension of interactions in the process of detecting hierarchical ties. We experiment on two datasets, the Enron email dataset to infer manager-subordinate relationships from email exchanges, and a scientific publication co-authorship dataset to detect PhD advisor-advisee relationships from paper co-authorships. Our experiments show that time-based methods perform considerably better than ranking-based methods. In the Enron dataset, they detect 48% of manager-subordinate ties versus 32% found by Rooted-PageRank. Similarly, in co-author dataset, they detect 62% of advisor-advisee ties compared to only 39% by Rooted-PageRank.},

Analysis of online data sources for dream interpretation using network science leads to understanding symbolism in dreams and their associated meaning. In this study, we introduce dream interpretation networks for English, Chinese and Arabic that represent different cultures from various parts of the world. We analyze communities in these networks, finding that symbols within a community are semantically related. The central nodes in communities give insight about cultures and symbols in dreams. The community structure of different networks highlights cultural similarities and differences. Interconnections between different networks are also identified by translating symbols from different languages into English. Structural correlations across networks point out relationships between cultures. Similarities between network communities are also investigated by analysis of sentiment in symbol interpretations. We find that interpretations within a community tend to have similar sentiment. Furthermore, we cluster communities based on their sentiment, yielding three main categories of positive, negative, and neutral dream symbols.},

abstract = {Automatically determining and assigning shared and meaningful text labels to data extracted from an e-Commerce web page is a challenging problem. An e-Commerce web page can display a list of data records, each of which can contain a combination of data items (e.g. product name and price) and explicit labels, which describe some of these data items. Recent advances in extraction techniques have made it much easier to precisely extract individual data items and labels from a web page, however, there are two open problems: 1. assigning an explicit label to a data item, and 2. determining labels for the remaining data items. Furthermore, improvements in the availability and coverage of vocabularies, especially in the context of e-Commerce web sites, means that we now have access to a bank of relevant, meaningful and shared labels which can be assigned to extracted data items.However, there is a need for a technique which will take as input a set of extracted data items and assign automatically to them the most relevant and meaningful labels from a shared vocabulary. We observe that the Information Extraction (IE) community has developed a great number of techniques which solve problems similar to our own. In this work-in-progress paper we propose our intention to theoretically and experimentally evaluate different IE techniques to ascertain which is most suitable to solve this problem.},

abstract = {Today the web has become the largest available source of information. The automatic extraction of structured data from web is a challenging problem that has been widely investigated. However, after the extraction process, the problem of identifying duplicates among the extracted web records must be solved in order to present clean data to the final user. This problem, also known as record linkage or record matching, has been of central interest for the database community; however, only few works have addressed this problem in the web context. In this paper we present web object matching, the problem of identifying duplicates among records extracted from the web.We will show that in the web scenario we need to face all the problems of a classic record linkage setting plus the uncertainty introduced by the web. Indeed the records are the output of an extraction system that, rather than conventional databases or APIs, introduces semantic errors that are not due to a problem in the source. Most of the previous approaches rely on the fact that the records to match contain the correct information and we can use such information to identify duplicates. In this work we overview an approach that performs a validation step before the actual identification of duplicates, in order to check whether the information of the record can be trusted or not. We present an approach that works without any human supervision or training data and that deals with the problem not only in a record-by-record fashion (as other approaches), but also in a source-by-source fashion which allows detecting and possibly correcting systematic errors for an entire source. The only human effort required is the creation of a little knowledge about the domain of interest through a set of ontology constraints and an entity extraction system.},

abstract = {Entity type matching has many real world applications, especially in entity clustering, de-duplication and efficient query processing. Current methods to extract entities from text usually disregard regularities in the order of entities appearing in the text. In this paper, we focus on enumerative descriptions which enlist entity names in a certain hidden order, often occurring in web documents as listings and tables. We propose an algorithm to discover entity types from enumerative descriptions, where a type hierarchy is known but enumerating orders are hidden and heterogeneous, and partial entity-type mappings are given as seed instances. Our algorithm is iterative: We extract skeletons from syntactic patterns, then train a hidden Markov model to find an optimum enumerating order from seed instances and skeletons, to find a best-fit entity-type assignment.},

abstract = {Users submit queries to an online database via its query interface. Query interface parsing, which is important for many applications, understands the query capabilities of a query interface. Since most query interfaces are organized hierarchically, we present a novel query interface parsing method, StatParser (Statistical Parser), to automatically extract the hierarchical query capabilities of query interfaces. StatParser automatically learns from a set of parsed query interfaces and parses new query interfaces. StatParser starts from a small grammar and enhances the grammar with a set of probabilities learned from parsed query interfaces under the maximum-entropy principle. Given a new query interface, the probability-enhanced-grammar identifies the parse tree with the largest global probability to be the query capabilities of the query interface. Experimental results show that StatParser very accurately extracts the query capabilities and can effectively overcome the problems of existing query interface parsers.},

abstract = {The extraction and integration of data from many web sources in different domains is an open issue. Two promising solutions take on this challenge: top down approaches rely on a domain knowledge that is manually crafted by an expert to guide the process and bottom up approaches try to infer the schema from many web sources to make sense of the extracted data. The first solutions scale over the number of web sources, but for settings with different domains, an expert has to manually craft an ontology for each domain. The second solutions do not require a domain expert, but high quality is achieved only with a lot of human interactions both in the extraction and integration steps. We introduce a framework that takes the best from both approaches. The framework addresses synergically both extraction and integration of data from web sources. No domain expert is required, it exploits data from a seed knowledge base to enhance the automatic extraction and integration (top down). Human workers from crowdsourcing platforms are engaged to improve the quality and the coverage of the extracted data. The framework adopts techniques to automatically extract both the schema and the data from multiple web sources (bottom up). The extracted information is then used to bootstrap the seed knowledge base, reducing in this way the human effort for future tasks.},

abstract = {Large numbers of websites have started to markup their content using standards such as Microdata, Microformats, and RDFa. The marked-up content elements comprise descriptions of people, organizations, places, events, products, ratings, and reviews. This development has accelerated in last years as major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! use the markup to improve their search results. Embedding semantic markup facilitates identifying content elements on webpages. However, the markup is mostly not as fine-grained as desirable for applications that aim to integrate data from large numbers of websites. This paper discusses the challenges that arise in the task of integrating descriptions of electronic products from several thousand e-shops that offer Microdata markup. We present a solution for each step of the data integration process including Microdata extraction, product classification, product feature extraction, identity resolution, and data fusion. We evaluate our processing pipeline using 1.9 million product offers from 9240 e-shops which we extracted from the Common Crawl 2012, a large public Web corpus.},

abstract = {Entity Linking (EL) consists in linking mentions in a document to their referent entities in a Knowledge Base. Current approaches fall into two main categories: local approaches, in which mentions are linked independently of each other, and global approaches, in which all mentions are linked collectively. Local approaches often ignore the semantic relatedness of entities, and while global approaches incorporate the semantic relatedness, they tend to focus only on directly connected entities, ignoring indirect connections which might be useful. We present a global EL approach that unifies the representation of the semantics of entities and documents--the probability distribution of entities being visited during a random walk on an entity graph--that accounts for direct and indirect connections. An experimental evaluation shows that our method outperforms five state-of-the-art EL systems and two very strong baselines.},

abstract = {The advent of social media has facilitated the study of information diffusion, user interaction and user influence over social networks. The research on analyzing information spreading focuses mostly on modeling, while analyses of real-life data have been limited to small, carefully cleaned datasets that are analyzed in an offline fashion. In this paper, we present an approach for online analysis of information diffusion in Twitter. We reconstruct so-called information cascades that model how information is being propagated from user to user from the stream of messages and the social graph. The results show that such an inference is feasible even on noisy, large-scale, rapidly produced data. We provide insights into the impact of incomplete data and the effect of different influence models on the cascades. The observed cascades show a significant amount of variety in scale and structure.},

abstract = {In recent years, real-time data mining for large-scale time-evolving graphs is becoming a hot research topic. Most of the prior arts target relatively static graphs and also process them in store-and-process batch processing model. In this paper we propose a method of applying on-the-fly and incremental graph stream computing model to such dynamic graph analysis. To process large-scale graph streams on a cluster of nodes dynamically in a scalable fashion, we propose an incremental large-scale graph processing model called "Incremental GIM-V (Generalized Iterative Matrix-Vector Multiplication)". We also design and implement UNICORN, a system that adopts the proposed incremental processing model on top of IBM InfoSphere Streams. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves up to 48% speedup on PageRank with Scale 16 Log-normal Graph (vertexes=65,536, edges=8,364,525) with 4 nodes, 3023% speedup on Random walk with Restart with Kronecker Graph with Scale 18 (vertexes=262,144, edges=8,388,608) with 4 nodes against original GIM-V.},

abstract = {The use of social application such as Twitter or FaceBook becomes popular in recent years. In particular, Twitter increases the number of the users rapidly from 2009 as the place that users can tweet anything in 140 characters. In the area of social network analysis, the user network of Twitter is frequently analyzed. Haewoon, et.al.,[1] analyzed the Twitter user network from various point of view in 2009, and they show that the Twitter user network has some different feature from conventional social networks. Bong- won, et.al., also made a collection of 74 millions tweets in 2010, and investigated the influence that "retweet" gives for diffusion of the information. Such analysis not only reveal the unique characteristics of Twitter user network, but also make some networking service such as finding users who are similar to someone, or the recommendation of commodities by using tweet information. There are some analysis such as clustering which needs entire data of the network. However, since social networks are increasing day by day, it becomes impossible to obtain the entire network by crawling. As a solution of this problem, there is the network analysis called link prediction. This enables to predict true network from a given part of the network. If we use link prediction, we can recover the entire network from the network data which we already obtained, and apply some analysis such as clustering to predicted net- work, then we may get the approximate result of the analysis for the entire network. In our research, we implemented one of the link prediction algorithm named Link Propagation in X10, which is a parallel programming language. And evaluated its scalability and precision with Twitter user network data.},
