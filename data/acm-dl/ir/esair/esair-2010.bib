abstract = {In the realm of Information Retrieval, why is Semantic Annotation needed? What has changed? Is it the users, the sources, the genres, the technologies, the applications, the queries? If there are differences, why and how can Semantic Annotation help? And more specifically, how and what is Natural Language Processing (NLP) contributing.This talk will share some practical use cases of where and how NLP-based semantic annotation has demonstrated its utility (or a solid promise of utility) in some information access tasks, by virtue of the depth and richness of annotation possible with today's more powerful NLP technologies. What is showing promise is the ability to understand how to utilize the higher levels of language processing to do Semantic Annotation. This is largely through the introduction of the Pragmatic level of language processing -- the functional perspective which provides the extra understanding that comes from the study of language in actual use. Pragmatics is concerned with the aspects of language which require context to be understood. Basically, how situational context is lexicalized and grammaticalized. In Pragmatics, the goal is to recognize the extra meaning that humans read into utterances, which other levels of language processing have not recognized as being encoded in them. Semantic Annotation can then go the next step and amplify current annotations with this additional contextual &amp; intentional knowledge.Examples will be shown of what is being done with NLP today that couldn't be done, or simply wasn't being done in earlier days of IR. In applications of keenest interest today, there is an increased relative emphasis focus on dialogue, interaction, real-time, social, and exploratory search, where understanding the user's intent or plan in their query is key. Applications in exploratory search, eDiscovery, sentiment recognition, collaborative search, along with very, very large scale medical insurance consumer applications will be considered in terms of how and what Semantic Annotations can improve by adding more advanced levels of Natural Language Processing},

abstract = {We compare the costs of semantic annotation of textual documents to its benefits for information processing tasks. Semantic annotation can improve the performance of retrieval tasks and facilitates an improved search experience through faceted search, focused retrieval, better document summaries, and result grouping. Applications which summarize large collections of text or explain real world phenomena based on textual evidence may receive even more benefit from semantic annotations.Semantic annotation creates surplus value if the annotated data can be used beyond any foreseen application. In particular by third parties linking your data by means of your semantic markup to other data with similar markup. We present a list of properties of the annotated data which optimize this surplus value. They are derived from the principle which states that annotation should facilitate the reuse of data in a mashup without information being lost or distorted.For the Dutch House of Parliament we annotated the parliamentary proceedings based on this principle. Concrete examples from this data collection will illustrate the surplus value enhancing properties.},

Then the queries are expanded by translated compound words, noun phrases with the bilingual dictionary. At the same time, document related to the translated query are retrieved with a TF-IDF term weighting model. Then, top 100 retrieved documents are re-ranked by a specificity-considered concept base with noun phrases and compound words extracted from the query. Re-ranked results are combined with the results retrieved by the Probabilistic model. For the evaluation of the proposed method, we use the average precision of the interpolated recall and precision at to compare with the NTCIR1 participation systems. The proposed system achieved the highest precision compared with the NTCIR1 participating systems.},

We use Fillmore's thematic roles to explicitly denote the semantic relations in a sentence.Semantic annotations also maintain the connection between textual artifacts and their corresponding model elements. Therefore changes in the domain model can be fed back to the textual specification. Additionally, changes in the textual specification can be analyzed and their impact towards the software model can be assessed.},

abstract = {The development of the Semantic Web depends on agreed and unambiguous knowledge representations, on the availability and accessibility of knowledge, and on retrieval capabilities. The scarce agreement on knowledge representation and the lack of techniques to process semantic structures in web search engines makes it impossible to perform contextualized conceptual retrieval. These limitations imply that users must know beforehand the existence and location of this knowledge to be able to retrieve it. Thus, different ad-hoc knowledge representations and metadata vocabularies, scarcely formalized and agreed on, have been published, hindering the reuse and interoperability. Our proposal has as its main goal the elaboration of different views to improve the representation of semantic documents. This approach facilitates the management and retrieval of heterogeneous semantic schemas by means of a multilevel ontological structure and the alignment with a reference ontology that provides conceptual retrieval and reuse of knowledge.},

This is due to the number of ways the search concepts may be expressed in texts. The effects of the vocabulary mismatch can be alleviated via query expansion and document annotation through thesauri, tags or ontologies. On the one hand, users would benefit from ontology-based annotation. On the other hand for overcoming fuzzy search goals users need to analyze the search results and reformulate their queries. In the present paper we suggest ontologies for retrieval and annotation and describe a tool supporting online ontology editing and ontology-based multilingual document exploration.

This framework combines a core observational model, domain-specific ontologies compatible with the core model, and a semantic annotation language. The annotation language provides a formal bridge between the core model and the underlying data to enable queries and analysis over annotations.
