abstract = {This talk addresses the theme how semantic annotations could improve information access. In this context, "semantic annotation" may refer to any (perhaps typed) clue about documents in a collection that can be useful for retrieval purposes: the call for papers of the ESAIR workshop mentions examples varying from automatically assigned linguistic annotations like named entities to manually assigned social media tags. While any clue could in principle be useful for retrieval, it can be expected to prove extremely hard (if not impossible) to ever provide a single canned solution, the one size fits all "semantically enhanced retrieval model", that would not just match information need representations with document representations, but also automatically determine how to best interpret the individual relative contribution of all those types of clues. In this talk, I explore an alternative route - can we empower the user to express which semantic annotations should be exploited, such that we do not need to define an a priori fixed retrieval model, but instead may provide the user the building blocks with which they can create their own retrieval model, specific to the information need at hand. Is this at all feasible? What challenges are there to be addressed?},

abstract = {While Information Retrieval approaches typically rely on a bag-of-word approach and are therefore fairly shallow, Knowledge Management is based on a deep semantic representation. Both allow users to sift through huge volumes of information and to identify the relevant document or answer for a particular information need. Obviously, these areas go beyond this simple information access scenario. Nevertheless, it is also a fact that these areas form fairly separate communities. We propose an idea of how to make use of techniques coming from both ends of the spectrum and combine them in methods that are more powerful than each of them individually. Our idea is based on turning structured information into virtual documents built to preserve the concepts and relations inherent in the semantically rich data before we apply Information Retrieval methods.},

The potential of semantic annotation is not realized in shallow navigational search but holds the promise to significantly enhance complex tasks or information needs, by supporting the task as a whole over multiple interactions with the system. We analyse the different phases of interaction for a complex search task, and give insight in different goals of the interaction in each the phase. The resulting model of interaction suggests ways in which the semantic annotation can be exploited to iteratively articulate the information need and to explore the search results.},

abstract = {Attribution has attracted increasing attention in recent years following the development of Opinion Analysis and Information Extraction applications. Given a piece of information or an opinion, being able to correctly identify its source (either a specific entity e.g. President Obama or a class thereof e.g. experts, official sources, rumours) and determine how different sources and features of attribution affect the way information is perceived would be extremely beneficial. It would in fact enhance opinion-oriented applications of Language Technology and revolutionise the way we can select information, e.g. on the basis of source expertise and reliability. However, approaches to the automatic extraction of attribution relations have achieved only partial results to date and are therefore not sufficient to enable the development of reliable applications. In addition, there has been little or no attempt to discern the impact of different sources and attribution strategies on the perception and interpretation of the attributed material. Grounded on previous analysis of this relation in Italian [2] and English [4] news corpora, this study addresses several of the attribution strategies identified to develop a more comprehensive system for the extraction of attributions and their relevant features from news texts.},

Thus, by starting with an input entity, the system extracts the first 200 web pages found on a Google search for the particular entity, extracts relevant paragraphs that contain the entity, and then performs semantic role labeling on the extracted paragraphs. The main goal is to identify the role this entity plays, as well as the roles played by words frequently co-occurring with the input entity.},
