abstract = {Computational approaches to problems in Natural Language Understanding and Information Extraction are often modeled as structured predictions - predictions that involve assigning values to sets of interdependent variables. Over the last few years, one of the most successful approaches to studying these problems involves Constrained Conditional Models (CCMs), an Integer Learning Programming formulation that augments probabilistic models with declarative constraints as a way to support such decisions.I will focus on exemplifying this framework in the context of developing better semantic analysis of sentences - Extended Semantic Role Labeling - and the task of Wikification - identifying concepts and entities in text and disambiguating them into Wikipedia or other knowledge bases.},

abstract = {The ability to read and understand a text would seem to be a basic aspect of interacting with a rich information source like the Web, yet little is currently known about the nature of the Web, its users, and how users interact with content when seen through the lens of reading difficulty. For example, a document isn't relevant to a person's information need - at least, not immediately - if they can't understand it, yet Web search engines have traditionally ignored the problem of finding or providing content at the right level of difficulty as an aspect of relevance. I'll give an overview of recent research that shows how computing and applying metadata based on text readability at Web scale opens up new and sometimes surprising possibilities for enriching our interactions with the Web: from personalizing Web search results, to predicting user and site expertise, to estimating searcher motivation. I'll also highlight future challenges and opportunities in improving text readability analysis, particularly in light of the rapidly growing interest in large-scale applications for online education.},

Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) approach for query expansion is useful in many Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. However, this approach does not work well in the case of very short queries. Therefore, we present instead of PRF a semantic query enrichment method based on Wikipedia. This method expands short queries by semantically related terms extracted from Wikipedia. Our experiments on cultural heritage corpora show significant improvement in the retrieval performance.},

abstract = {Over the past couple of years micro blogging platforms, such as Twitter, have become extremely popular for information generation and dissemination. Each day hundreds of millions of tweets are being published, containing fresh and trending information that is highly valuable for online users. However, discovering relevant information from such sources is becoming harder due to their rapid growth and the fact that social fragments are often short and noisy. Aggregation techniques such as clustering are often used for extracting this relevant information, since interesting signals begin to emerge when these fragments are grouped together. Clustering large amount of short tweets with limited features is however a challenging task in itself. In this paper, we propose to aggregate tweets by pivoting on entities and mapping them to topics that are already defined in websites such as Wikipedia and Freebase. This allows us to aggregate tweets in a more reliable and feasible way while providing interesting aggregated information about entities present in these fragments. Our analysis using large amounts of tweets shows that such an approach indeed works well. We present encouraging results and various interesting applications centered on entities.},

abstract = {We introduce Dexter, an open source framework for entity linking. The entity linking task aims at identifying all the small text fragments in a document referring to an entity contained in a given knowledge base, e.g., Wikipedia. The annotation is usually organized in three tasks. Given an input document the first task consists in discovering the fragments that could refer to an entity. Since a mention could refer to multiple entities, it is necessary to perform a disambiguation step, where the correct entity is selected among the candidates. Finally, discovered entities are ranked by some measure of relevance. Many entity linking algorithms have been proposed, but unfortunately only a few authors have released the source code or some APIs. As a result, evaluating today the performance of a method on a single subtask, or comparing different techniques is difficult. In this work we present a new open framework, called Dexter, which implements some popular algorithms and provides all the tools needed to develop any entity linking technique. We believe that a shared framework is fundamental to perform fair comparisons and improve the state of the art.},

abstract = {The contents of the image files can be completely different per se, if we consider the descriptors such as color histograms, textures, edge histograms, etc., however they might have the same semantic metadata, such as user tags, at the same time. The exploitation of user tags in image search tasks results in lower computational costs considering much smaller number of features that are necessary to compute the similarity between the objects, as well as it helps to overcome the semantic gap (this kind of similarity is, of course, different from the one computed in content-based methods). Thanks to these two properties it becomes very easy to create an interactive image search system that is based on online learning from interaction between the user and the system. We propose a simple algorithm for system training, that uses dwell-time data as input parameters for relevance recalculation, which we implemented in the prototype of our experimental search system.},

We constructed the hierarchical structure of the candidate strings according to the proposed process, and ranked them using this structure and the frequency information for each group of the candidate strings in the area satisfying the diversity requirement of the hierarchical structure.
