abstract = {In recent years, universities have adopted eLearning solutions as part of their learning resources to provide students with digital and multimedia content. The effect of this strategy is that the educational materials in electronic format are replacing in part (or as a whole) the classic printed books. In this paper we present our strategy of integrating in a single resource an electronic book with a companion eLearning website. Instead of considering the textbook and the eLearning website as two distinct resources that have to be adopted by the students of the course, here we propose a unified approach that integrates both in a single resource.},

abstract = {Currently, in the early days of their development, e-books are essentially following the evolutionary path of physical books, a path that started thousands of years ago. Yet physical books are containers for a wide variety of information types, and are accessed in a wide variety of ways, which offers the possibility of differing electronic manifestations. The evolutionary approach will continue to be reasonably successful in meeting current needs, but the real growth in the adoption of e-books will happen when the traditional book is deconstructed and reconstructed (textually, behaviorally and commercially) in order to create new paradigms for storing and delivering content in electronic forms.},

abstract = {This paper proposes new extensions of the digital book concept together with the required approaches to support their automatic generation. Most best-sellers have often inspired other related products, sometimes in different media. Some of these can be merged into suitable forms to provide consumers with a better view and understanding of the original masterpiece: other texts about the original book, images, audio recordings or even films. Several standards and technologies, such as hypermedia, speech and language processing, and widely accessible PDAs, are nowadays available to make these experiences effective. A prototype of a Multimedia Enriched Digital Book (MEDB) is presented for reading, listening and viewing as well as for a text querying scenario. Within the scope of already available technologies, these are tangible visions for the very next years.},

abstract = {Reading online poses a number of technological challenges. Advances in technology such as touch screens, light-weight high-power computers, and bi-stable displays have periodically renewed interest in online reading over the last twenty years, only to see that interest decline to a small early-adopter community. The recent release of the Kindle by Amazon is another attempt to create an online reading device. Has publicity surrounding Kindle and other such devices has reached critical mass to allow them to penetrate the consumer market successfully, or will we see a decline in interest over the next couple of years echoing the lifecycle of Softbook™ and Rocket eBook™ devices that preceded them? I argue that the true value of online reading lies in supporting activities beyond reading per se: activities such as annotation, reading and comparing multiple documents, transitions between reading, writing and retrieval, etc. Whether the current hardware will be successful in the long term may depend on its abilities to address the reading needs of knowledge workers, not just leisure readers.},

abstract = {More than 32M unique book titles are available in US libraries, but Amazon, the biggest retailer, had only 1.2M unique titles available for sale in 2004. Currently there is an effort underway by public libraries, universities, the Open Content Alliance, Google and others, to non-destructively scan these 32M unique books and make them available for on-line viewing and search. Twenty percent (6.4M) of the 32M titles are out of copyright and out of print. A publisher estimates that an average of 40 copies of each title can be sold per year if they could be made available for sale. This long tail opportunity represents a several billion dollar market with the right cost structure. To address this long-tail book market we need to take the cost out of several parts of the value chain: automatic book preparation to minimize publishing setup costs, print-on-demand to remove warehouse and waste costs, and web 2.0 techniques to minimize marketing costs. We have created this system with several partners based on HP technology, and available as an incubation business.},

This paper explores the relative contribution of different parts of digitized and OCR'ed books towards effective retrieval. The examined parts include the entire content of books, book headings, book titles, and table of content entries. Results show that indexing the headers and titles of books is nearly as effective as indexing the entire contents of books. These results indicate that certain portions of the books, specifically titles and headers, are more valuable than other parts of books. This is akin to web search where hypertext and page titles are more valuable to index than the rest of the webpage. Also, using a combination of evidence approach provides further improved retrieval effectiveness compared to using any portion of the book in isolation.},

abstract = {This position paper explores the issues related to the feasibility of having a primarily digital research library support the teaching and research needs of a university. The Asian University for Women (AUW), a new university in Chittagong, Bangladesh, will open in September 2009. It must make a decision regarding the investment to be made in research resources to support the university. Mass digitization efforts now make it possible to consider establishing a research library that consists primarily of digital resources rather than print. There are, however, many issues that make this consideration quite complex and far from certain. In this paper we explore the issues at a preliminary level. We focus on four broad perspectives in order to begin addressing the complex interactions that must be considered in transitioning to a primarily digital research environment: technical, economic, policy and social issues. The purpose of this paper is to begin to explore a research agenda for transitioning from a model for libraries where resources are primarily print to one that is predominantly digital. Our research in this area is just beginning, so our purpose is to raise the issues rather than offer firm conclusions.},
