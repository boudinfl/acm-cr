abstract = {Sketches and drawings have an integral role in the communication of ideas and form concepts. In this tutorial we focus on the use of sketches in the design and manufacturing process. Here, the drawing adapts from an initial, rough concept sketch to precise machine-drawings. While several computer-aided design tools exist which support the use of different drawings, the abmiguity that is typically associated with initial sketches often means that the initial concept sketch needs to be redrawn according to the specific interfaces used within these systems. This tutorial discusses the challenges that exist in the interpretation of sketches and presents drawing interpretation techniques that address some of these challenges.},

abstract = {The mathematical contents of scientific publications in PDF format cannot be easily analyzed by regular PDF parsers and OCR tools. In this paper, we propose a novel OCR system called PDF2LaTeX, which extracts math expressions and text in both postscript and image-based PDF files and translates them into LaTeX markup. As a preprocessing step, PDF2LaTeX first renders a PDF file into its image format, and then uses projection profile cutting (PPC) to analyze the page layout. The analysis of math expressions and text is based on a series of deep learning algorithms. First, it uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a binary classifier to detect math image blocks based on visual features. Next, it uses a conditional random field (CRF) to detect math-text boundaries by incorporating semantics and context information. In the end, the system uses two different models based on a CNN-LSTM neural network architecture to translate image blocks of math expressions and plaintext into the LaTeX representations. For testing, we created a new dataset composed of 102 PDF pages collected from publications on arXiv.org and compared the performance between PDF2LaTeX and the state-of-the-art commercial software InftyReader. The experiment results showed that the proposed system achieved a better recognition accuracy (81.1%) measured by the string edit distance between the predicted LaTeX and the ground truth.},

The extraction and analysis of differences between two XML document versions is an attractive topic, and has already been tackled by several research groups. The goal of this study is to compare 12 existing state-of-the-art and commercial XML diff algorithms by applying them to JATS documents in order to extract and evaluate changes between two versions of the same academic article. Understanding changes between two article versions is important not only regarding data, but also semantics. Change information consumers in our case are editorial teams, and thus they are more generally interested in change semantics than in the exact data changes. The existing algorithms are evaluated on the following aspects: their edit detection suitability for both text and tree changes, execution speed, memory usage and delta file size. The evaluation process is supported by a Python tool available on Github.},

abstract = {Engineering drawings, scientific data, and governmental document repositories rely on degraded two-dimensional images to represent physical three-dimensional objects. The collection of two-dimensional multiview images are generated from a set of known camera positions that are aimed directly at the target object. These images provide a convenient method for representing the original physical object but significantly degrades the interpretability of the object. The multiview images from the document repositories may be integrated to reconstruct an approximation of the original physical object as a point cloud. We show that retrieval methods for documents are improved by directly sampling point clouds from the multiview image set to reconstruct the original physical object. We compare the retrieval results from direct image retrieval, multiview convolutional neural networks (MVCNN), and point clouds reconstructed from sampled images. To evaluate these models, we trained them on line drawings generated from models in the ShapeNet Core data set. We show retrieval of the reconstructed object is more accurate than single image retrieval or the multiview image set retrieval.},

We present Cardinal Graph Convolutional Networks (CGCN), an efficient and flexible extension of GCNs with cardinal-direction awareness of spatial node arrangement. The formulation of CGCNs retains the traditional GCN permutation invariance, ensuring directional neighbors are involved in learning abstract representations, even in the absence of a proper ordering of the nodes. We show that CGCNs achieve state of the art results on an invoice information extraction task, jointly learning a word-level tagging as well as document meta-level classification and regression. We also present a new multiscale Inception-like CGCN block-layer, as well as Conv-Pool-DeConv-DePool UNet-like architecture, which increase the receptive field. We demonstrate the utility of CGCNs on private and public datasets, with respect to several baseline models: sequential LSTM, transformer classifier, non-cardinal GCNs, and an image-convolutional approach.},

Authors use their understanding of the domain when structuring and formatting the content of a textbook to facilitate this explanation. As a result, the formatting and structural elements of textbooks carry the elements of domain knowledge implicitly encoded by their authors. Our paper presents an extendable approach towards automated extraction of this knowledge from textbooks taking into account their formatting rules and internal structure. We focus on PDF as the most common textbook representation format; however, the overall method is applicable to other formats as well. The evaluation experiments examine the accuracy of the approach, as well as the pragmatic quality of the obtained knowledge models using one of their possible applications -- semantic linking of textbooks in the same domain. The results indicate high accuracy of model construction on symbolic, syntactic and structural levels across textbooks and domains, and demonstrate the added value of the extracted models on the semantic level.},

abstract = {The unprecedented growth of textual content on the Web made essential the development of automatic or semi-automatic techniques to help people to find valuable information in such a huge heap of text data. Automatic text summarization is one of such techniques that is being pointed out as offering a viable solution in such a chaotic scenario. Extractive text summarization, in particular, selects a set of sentences from a text according to specific criteria. Strategies for extractive summarization can benefit from preprocessing techniques that emphasize the relevance or infor-mativeness of sentences with respect to the selection criteria. This paper tests such a hypothesis using sentence simplification methods. Four methods are used to simplify a corpus of news articles in English: a rule-based method, an optimization method, a supervised deep learning model and an unsupervised deep learning model. The simplified outputs are summarized using 14 sentence selection strategies. The combinations of simplification and summarization methods are compared with the baseline --- the summarized corpus without previous simplification --- with a quantitative analysis, which suggests sentence compression with restrictions and models learned from large parallel corpora tend to perform better and yield gains over summarization without prior simplification.},

In particular, word representation learning, a.k.a. word embeddings has triggered progress in different natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite the success of word embeddings in tasks such as named entity recognition or textual entailment, their use is still embryonic in query expansion. In this work, we examine the usefulness of word embeddings to represent queries and documents in query-document matching tasks. For this purpose, we use a re-ranking strategy. The re-ranking phase is conducted using representations of queries and documents based on word embeddings. We introduce IDF average word embeddings, a new text representation strategy based on word embeddings, which allows us to create a query vector representation that provides higher relevance to informative terms during the process. Experimental results in TREC benchmark datasets show that our proposal consistently achieves the best results in terms of MAP.},

abstract = {Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a task that offers a challenge in computer vision, where images are the only source of information. In fact, several approaches to optical models have been developed, such as through of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or recurrent Bidirectional/Multidimensional layers. The current state-of-the-art consists of combined deep learning techniques, the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN), in which recurrent layers still suffer from vanishing gradient problem when processing very long texts. In a way, high-performance models generally have millions of trainable parameters and a high computational cost. However, recently a new optical model architecture, Gated-CNN, demonstrated improvements to complement CRNN modeling. Thus, in this work, we present a new small architecture for HTR (based on Gated-CNN) integrated with two steps of language model at the character and word levels, respectively. Therefore, we used 9 state-of-the-art approaches and validated the results using the IAM public dataset. Finally, the proposed model surpasses the results obtained by different approaches in the literature, reaching recognition rates of CER 2.7% and WER 5.6%, which means an improvement of 13% over the best results on IAM dataset.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a framework to uncover potential causal relations between event mentions from streaming text of news media. This framework relies on a dataset of manually labeled events to train a recurrent neural network for event detection. It then creates a time series of event clusters, where clusters are based on BERT contextual word embedding representations of the identified events. Using these time series dataset, we assess four methods based on Granger causality for inferring causal relations. Granger causality is a statistical concept of causality that is based on forecasting. It states that a cause occurs before the effect, and the cause produces unique changes in the effect, so past values of the cause help predict future values of the effect. The four analyzed methods are the pairwise Granger test, VAR(1), BigVar and SiMoNe. The framework is applied to the New York Times dataset, which covers news for a period of 246 months. This preliminary analysis delivers important insights into the nature of each method, identifies differences and commonalities, and points out some of their strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract = {The Proceedings of the Old Bailey is a corpus of over 180,000 page images of court records printed from April 1674 to April 1913 and presents a comprehensive challenge for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) services. The Old Bailey is an ideal benchmark for historical document OCR, representing more than two centuries of variations in documents, including spellings, formats, and printing and preservation qualities. In addition to its historical and sociological significance, the Old Bailey is filled with imperfections that reflect the reality of coping with large-scale historical data. Most importantly, the Old Bailey contains human transcriptions for each page, which can be used to help measure OCR accuracy. Since humans do make mistakes in transcriptions, the relative performance of OCR services will be more informative than their absolute performance. This paper compares three leading commercial OCR cloud services: Amazon Web Services's Textract (AWS); Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services (Azure); and Google Cloud Platform's Vision (GCP). Benchmarking involved downloading over 180,000 images, executing the OCR, and measuring the error rate of the OCR text against the human transcriptions. Our results found that AWS had the lowest median error rate, Azure had the lowest median round trip time, and GCP had the best combination of a low error rate and a low duration.},

abstract = {In an era, where large numbers of academic research papers are submitted to conferences and journals, the voluntary services of academicians to manage them, is indispensable. The call for contributions of research papers -- through an e-mail or as a webpage, not only solicits research works from scientists, but also lists the names of the researchers and their roles in managing the conference. Tracking such information which showcases the researchers' leadership qualities is becoming increasingly important. Here we present ServiceMarq - a system which proactively tracks service contributions to conferences. It performs focused crawling for website-based call for papers, and integrates archival and natural language processing libraries to achieve both high precision and recall in extracting information. Our results indicate that aggregated service contribution gives an alternative but correlated picture of institutional quality compared against standard bibliometrics. In addition, we have developed a proof of concept website to track service contributions and is available at https://cfp-mining-fe.herokuapp.com and our github repo is available at https://github.com/shitian007/cfp-mining},

abstract = {We develop an enhanced version of CORD-19 dataset released by the Allen Institute for AI. Tools in the SeerSuite project are used to exploit information in original articles not directly provided in the CORD-19 datasets. We add 728 new abstracts, 70,102 figures and 31,446 tables with captions that are not provided in the current data release. We also built a vertical search engine COVIDSeer based on the new dataset we created. COVIDSeer has a relatively simple architecture with features like keyword filtering, and similar paper recommendation. The goal was to provide a system and dataset that can help scientists better navigate through the literature concerning COVID-19. The enriched dataset can serve as a supplement to the existing dataset. The search engine, which offers keyphrase-enhanced search, will hopefully help biomedical and life science researchers, medical students, and the general public to more effectively explore coronavirus-related literature. The entire data set and the system will be made open source.},

abstract = {This paper explores a novel application of document generation: the automatic creation of residential electrical plans from architectural data. Electrical plan documents, crucial to all residential construction and renovation projects, are currently generated manually by electrical designers who must adhere to the local electrical code and follow industry best practices. The designers decide the type and location of all household electrical devices and outlets based on the architectural floor plans. This is a tedious, highly repetitive, and time-consuming task. We propose a procedural approach to automate the generation of residential electrical plans via a stack-based finite state machine model that mimics the electrical designer's thought process. The system receives 2D architectural data (e.g. wall location) as input and yields a customized electrical plan as output. Experimental results on a variety of architectural layouts of bathrooms, bedrooms, and kitchens are very promising and demonstrate the approach's functionality and usefulness. This paper paves the way for new algorithmic tools facilitating the design cycle of building projects.},
