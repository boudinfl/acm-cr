abstract = {Visual Text Analytics has been an active area of interdisciplinary research (http://textvis.lnu.se/). This interactive tutorial is designed to give attendees an introduction to the area of information visualization, with a focus on linguistic visualization. After an introduction to the basic principles of information visualization and visual analytics, this tutorial will give an overview of the broad spectrum of linguistic and text visualization techniques, as well as their application areas [3]. This will be followed by a hands-on session that will allow participants to design their own visualizations using tools (e.g., Tableau), libraries (e.g., d3.js), or applying sketching techniques [4]. Some sample datasets will be provided by the instructor. Besides general techniques, special access will be provided to use the VisArgue framework [1] for the analysis of selected datasets.},

Therefore, the main goal of this workshop, which will be held at DocEng 2018, is to stimulate discussion on this topic among experts in the document engineering field and provide a forum for the exchange of ideas.The second goal of the workshop is more hands-on: for generating the Post-Proceedings, we will be trialling a new workflow, which is based on some of the technologies discussed. The results will be reported to the DocEng Steering Committee and recommendations will be made future conferences.},

abstract = {The last ten years have witnessed an enormous increase in the application of "deep learning" methods to both spoken and textual natural language processing. Have they helped? With respect to some well-defined tasks such as language modelling and acoustic modelling, the answer is most certainly affirmative, but those are mere components of the real applications that are driving the increasing interest in our field. In many of these real applications, the answer is surprisingly that we cannot be certain because of the shambolic evaluation standards that have been commonplace --- long before the deep learning renaissance --- in the communities that specialized in advancing them.This talk will consider three examples in detail: sentiment analysis, text-to-speech synthesis, and summarization. We will discuss empirical grounding, the use of inferential statistics alongside the usual, more engineering-oriented pattern recognition techniques, and the use of machine learning in the process of conducting an evaluation itself.},

abstract = {The objective of high-recall information retrieval (HRIR) is to identify substantially all information relevant to an information need, where the consequences of missing or untimely results may have serious legal, policy, health, social, safety, defence, or financial implications. To find acceptance in practice, HRIR technologies must be more effective---and must be shown to be more effective---than current practice, according to the legal, statutory, regulatory, ethical, or professional standards governing the application domain. Such domains include, but are not limited to, electronic discovery in legal proceedings; distinguishing between public and non-public records in the curation of government archives; systematic review for meta-analysis in evidence-based medicine; separating irregularities and intentional misstatements from unintentional errors in accounting restatements; performing "due diligence" in connection with pending mergers, acquisitions, and financing transactions; and surveillance and compliance activities involving massive datasets. HRIR differs from ad hoc information retrieval where the objective is to identify the best, rather than all relevant information, and from classification or categorization where the objective is to separate relevant from non-relevant information based on previously labeled training examples. HRIR is further differentiated from established information retrieval applications by the need to quantify "substantially all relevant information"; an objective for which existing evaluation strategies and measures, such as precision and recall, are not particularly well suited.},

STEVE aims at allowing users with no knowledge of multimedia authoring languages and models to create hypermedia applications for web and digital TV systems in a user-friendly way. Compared with existing multimedia authoring tools, STEVE is the unique tool that allows ordinary users to export hypermedia applications to HTML5 and NCL documents. STEVE uses an event-based temporal synchronization model called SIMM that exactly fits its needs. SIMM provides high-level temporal, spatial and interactivity relations to make authoring with STEVE easier. Usability tests show that, according to users, STEVE allowed them to create multimedia applications and export them as HTML5 and NCL documents in a few minutes without programming.},

abstract = {The text processing tool LATEX has prevailed as a standard in many fields of exact sciences; it is evident that LATEX is likely to be here to stay. From that perspective, it is important to explore what are the best possible ways to support the author in efficiently editing documents. There have been several approaches that provide graphical editing support for LATEX. We argue that a true WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) approach is a justified requirement for future systems and we present here the first cloud-based true WYSIWYG editor. This allows the author to edit the document in its print form directly in a web-based PDF viewer. Building such a system creates unique challenges compared to existing approaches. We identify these challenges and name workable solutions. We also provide a usability evaluation of the new system. In short our finding is that editing LATEX directly in the PDF view is possible for a wide range of edits and valuable for many major user groups and use cases; hence it is a fair requirement for future top-of-the-line LATEX editors.},

The qualitative study aimed at measuring the users' attitude towards using BumbAR and an augmented reality environment for authoring multimedia presentations. The results show that the participants found the BumbAR approach both useful and easy-to-use, while most of them (66,67%) found the system more convenient than traditional desktop-based authoring tools.},

abstract = {This paper examines the document aspects of object-based broadcasting. Object-based broadcasting augments traditional video and audio broadcast content with additional (temporally-constrained) media objects. The content of these objects -- as well as their temporal validity -- are determined by the broadcast source, but the actual rendering and placement of these objects can be customized to the needs/constraints of the content viewer(s). The use of object-based broadcasting enables a more tailored end-user experience than the one-size-fits-all of traditional broadcasts: the viewer may be able to selectively turn off overlay graphics (such as statistics) during a sports game, or selectively render them on a secondary device. Object-based broadcasting also holds the potential for supporting presentation adaptivity for accessibility or for device heterogeneity.From a technology perspective, object-based broadcasting resembles a traditional IP media stream, accompanied by a structured multimedia document that contains timed rendering instructions. Unfortunately, the use of object-based broadcasting is severely limited because of the problems it poses for the traditional television production workflow (and in particular, for use in live television production). The traditional workflow places graphics, effects and replays as immutable components in the main audio/video feed originating from, for example, a production truck outside a sports stadium. This single feed is then delivered near-live to the homes of all viewers. In order to effectively support dynamic object-based broadcasting, the production workflow will need to retain a familiar creative interface to the production staff, but also allow the insertion and delivery of a differentiated set of objects for selective use at the receiving end.In this paper we present a model and implementation of a dynamic system for supporting object-based broadcasting in the context of a motor sport application. We define a new multimedia document format that supports dynamic modifications during playback; this allows editing decisions by the producer to be activated by agents at the receiving end of the content. We describe a prototype system to allow playback of these broadcasts and a production system that allows live object-based control within the production workflow. We conclude with an evaluation of a trial using near-live deployment of the environment, using content from our partners, in a sport environment.},

abstract = {PDF is the established format for the exchange of final-form print-oriented documents on the Web, and for a good reason: it is the only format that guarantees the preservation of layout across different platforms, systems and viewing devices. Its main disadvantage, however, is that a document, once converted to PDF, is very difficult to edit. As of today (2018), there is still no universal format for the exchange of editable formatted text documents on the Web; users can only exchange the application's source files, which do not benefit from the robustness and portability of PDF.This position paper describes how we can engineer such an editable format based on some of the principles of PDF. We begin by analysing the current status quo, and provide a summary of current approaches for editing existing PDFs, other relevant document formats, and ways to embed the document's structure into the PDF itself. We then ask ourselves what it really means for a formatted document to be editable, and discuss the related problem of enabling WYSIWYG direct manipulation even in cases where layout is usually computed or optimized using offline or batch methods (as is common with long-form documents).After defining our goals, we propose a framework for creating such editable portable documents and present a prototype tool that demonstrates our initial steps and serves as a proof of concept. We conclude by providing a roadmap for future work.},

The output of the model is a list of documents retrieved based on the domain expert feedback collected during training. A modified version of Bag of Word (BoW) representation and a semantic ranking module, based on Google n-grams, are used in the model. The core of the system is a binary document classification model which is trained through a continuous active learning strategy. In general, finding or constructing training data for this type of problem is very difficult due to either confidentiality of the data, or the need for domain expert time to label data. Our experimental results on the retrieval of Call For Papers based on a manuscript demonstrate the efficacy of the system to address this application and its performance compared to other candidate models.},

abstract = {Document engineering employs practices of modeling and representation. Enactment of these practices relies on shared metaphors. However, choices driven by metaphor often receive less attention than those driven by factors critical to developing working systems, such as performance and usability. One way to remedy this issue is to take a historical approach, studying cases without a guiding concern for their ongoing development and maintenance. In this paper, we compare two historical case studies of "failed" designs for hypertext on the Web. The first case is netomat (1999), a Web browser created by the artist Maciej Wisniewski, which responded to search queries with dynamic multimedia streams culled from across the Web and structured by a custom markup language. The second is the XML Linking Language (XLink), a W3C standard to express hypertext links within and between XML documents. Our analysis focuses on the relationship between the metaphors used to make sense of Web documents and the hypermedia structures they compose. The metaphors offered by netomat and XLink stand as alternatives to metaphors of the "page" or the "app." Our intent here is not to argue that any of these metaphors are superior, but to consider how designers' and engineers' metaphorical choices are situated within a complex of already existing factors shaping Web technology and practice. The results provide insight into underexplored interconnections between art and document engineering at a critical moment in the history of the Web, and demonstrate the value for designers and engineers of studying "paths not taken" during the history of the technologies we work on today.},

abstract = {In this contemporaneous world, it is an obligation for any organization working with documents to end up with the insipid task of classifying truckload of documents, which is the nascent stage of venturing into the realm of information retrieval and data mining. But classification of such humongous documents into multiple classes, calls for a lot of time and labor. Hence a system which could classify these documents with acceptable accuracy would be of an unfathomable help in document engineering. We have created multiple classifiers for document classification and compared their accuracy on raw and processed data. We have garnered data used in a corporate organization as well as publicly available data for comparison. Data is processed by removing the stop-words and stemming is implemented to produce root words. Multiple traditional machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random forest Classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron are used for classification of documents. Classifiers are applied on raw and processed data separately and their accuracy is noted. Along with this, Deep learning technique such as Convolution Neural Network is also used to classify the data and its accuracy is compared with that of traditional machine learning techniques. We are also exploring hierarchical classifiers for classification of classes and subclasses. The system classifies the data faster and with better accuracy than if done manually. The results are discussed in the results and evaluation section.},

Our approach is based on the use of information extraction techniques for identification of trends in large aggregations of social media data. It is cost-effective method that reduces the possibility of errors associated with the design of the sample and the research instrument. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in the experiment performed on restaurant review data.

Following the approach proposed for the Tangent math search system, we use symbol layout trees to represent math formulae. We extract features from the symbol layout trees to serve as search terms to be ranked using BM25 and then explore the effects on retrieval performance of various classes of features. Based on the results, we recommend which features can be used effectively in a conventional text-based retrieval engine. We validate our overall approach using a NTCIR-12 math and text benchmark.},

abstract = {This paper presents two different prediction models of Mathematical Expression Constraints (ME-Con) in technical publications. Based on the assumption of independent probability distributions, two types of features: FS, based on the ME symbols; FW, based on the words adjacent to MEs, are used for analysis. The first prediction model is based on an iterative greedy scheme aiming to optimize the performance goal. The second scheme is based on na\"{\i}ve Bayesian inference of the two different feature types considering the likelihood of the training data. The first model achieved an average F1 scores of 69.5% (based on the tests made on an Elsevier dataset). The second prediction model using FS achieved 82.4% for F1 score and 81.8% accuracy. And it achieved similar yet slightly higher F1 scores as that of the first model for the word stems of FW, but slightly lower F1 score for the Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags of FW.1},

abstract = {Uncontrolled variants and duplicate content are ongoing problems in component content management; they decrease the overall reuse of content components. Similarity analyses can help to clean up existing databases and identify problematic texts, however, the large amount of data and intentional variants in technical texts make this a challenging task.We tackle this problem by using an efficient cosine similarity algorithm which leverages semantic information from XML-based information models. To verify our approach we built a browser-based prototype which can identify intentional variants by weighting semantic text properties with high performance. The prototype was successfully deployed in an industry project with a large-scale content corpus.},

Access rights to the materials can be verified to prevent printing. Digital images of the copied pages are checked against a database of copyrighted pages. To preserve the privacy of the copying of non-copyright materials, only digital fingerprints are submitted to the image matching service. A problem with such systems is creation of the database of copyright pages. To facilitate this, our system maintains statistics of clusters of similar unknown page images along with copy sequence. Once such a cluster has grown to a sufficient size, a human inspector can determine whether those page sequences are copyrighted. The system has been tested with 100,000s of pages from conference proceedings and with millions of randomly generated pages. Retrieval accuracy has been around 99% even with copies of copies or double-page copies.},

However, this top-k selection can be a performance bottleneck, especially when dealing with massive item sets and corpora. In this work we introduce Hash-Grams, an approach to perform top-k feature mining for classification problems. We show that the Hash-Gram approach can be up to three orders of magnitude faster than exact top-k selection algorithms. Using a malware corpus of over 2 TB in size, we show how Hash-Grams retain comparable classification accuracy, while dramatically reducing computational requirements.},

abstract = {Engineering design makes use of freehand sketches to communicate ideas, allowing designers to externalise form concepts quickly and naturally. Such sketches serve as working documents which demonstrate the evolution of the design process. For the product design to progress, however, these sketches are often redrawn using computer-aided design tools to obtain virtual, interactive prototypes of the design. Although there are commercial software packages which extract the required information from freehand sketches, such packages typically do not handle the complexity of the sketched drawings, particularly when considering the visual cues that are introduced to the sketch to aid the human observer to interpret the sketch. In this paper, we tackle one such complexity, namely the use of shading and shadows which help portray spatial and depth information in the sketch. For this reason, we propose a vectorisation algorithm, based on trainable COSFIRE filters for the detection of junction points and subsequent tracing of line paths to create a topology graph as a representation of the sketched object form. The vectorisation algorithm is evaluated on 17 sketches containing different shading patterns and drawn by different sketchers specifically for this work. Using these sketches, we show that the vectorisation algorithm can handle drawings with straight or curved contours containing shadow cues, reducing the salient point error in the junction point location by 91% of that obtained by the off-the-shelf Harris-Stephen's corner detector while the overall vectorial representations of the sketch achieved an average F-score of 0.92 in comparison to the ground truth. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {End-to-end Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are heavily used to convert document images into machine-readable text. Commercial and open-source OCR systems (like Abbyy, OCRopus, Tesseract etc.) have traditionally been optimized for contemporary documents like books, letters, memos, and other end-user documents. However, these systems are difficult to use equally well for digitizing historical document images, which contain degradations like non-uniform shading, bleed-through, and irregular layout; such degradations usually do not exist in contemporary document images.The open-source anyOCR is an end-to-end OCR pipeline, which contains state-of-the-art techniques that are required for digitizing degraded historical archives with high accuracy. However, high accuracy comes at a cost of high computational complexity that results in 1) long runtime that limits digitization of big collection of historical archives and 2) high energy consumption that is the most critical limiting factor for portable devices with constrained energy budget. Therefore, we are targeting energy efficient and high throughput acceleration of the anyOCR pipeline. Generalpurpose computing platforms fail to meet these requirements that makes custom hardware design mandatory. In this paper, we are presenting a new concept named iDocChip. It is a portable hybrid hardware-software FPGA-based accelerator that is characterized by low footprint meaning small size, high power efficiency that will allow using it in portable devices, and high throughput that will make it possible to process big collection of historical archives in real time without effecting the accuracy.In this paper, we focus on binarization, which is the second most critical step in the anyOCR pipeline after text-line recognizer that we have already presented in our previous publication [21]. The anyOCR system makes use of a Percentile Based Binarization method that is suitable for overcoming degradations like non-uniform shading and bleed-through. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first hardware architecture of the PBB technique. Based on the new architecture, we present a hybrid hardware-software FPGA-based accelerator that outperforms the existing anyOCR software implementation running on i7-4790T in terms of runtime by factor of 21, while achieving energy efficiency of 10 Images/J that is higher than that achieved by low power embedded processors with negligible loss of recognition accuracy.},

abstract = {Musical notation is a means of passing on performance instructions with fidelity to others. Composers, however, often introduced embellishments to the music they performed notating these embellishments with symbols next to the relevant notes. In time, these symbols, known as ornaments, and their interpretation became standardized such that there are acceptable ways of interpreting an ornament. Although music books may contain footnotes which express the ornament in full notation, these remain cumbersome to read. Ideally, a music student will have the possibility of selecting ornamented notes and express them as full notation. The student should also have the possibility to collapse the expressed ornament back to its symbolic representation, giving the student the possibility of also becoming familiar with playing from the ornamented score. In this paper, we propose a complete pipeline that achieves this goal. We compare the use of COSFIRE and template matching for optical music recognition to identify and extract musical content from the score. We then express the score using MusicXML and design a simple user interface which allows the user to select ornamented notes, view their expressed notation and decide whether they want to retain the expressed notation, modify it, or revert to the symbolic representation of the ornament. The performance results that we achieve indicate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

However, due to a multitude of proprietary document formats with rather simple link models, today's possibilities for creating hyperlinks between snippets of information in different document formats are limited. In previous work, we have presented a dynamically extensible cross-document link service overcoming the limitations of the simple link models supported by most existing document formats. Based on a plug-in mechanism, our link service enables the linking across different document types. In this paper, we assess the extensibility of our link service by integrating some document formats as well as third-party document viewers. We illustrate the flexibility of creating advanced hyperlinks across these document formats and viewers that cannot be realised with existing linking solutions or link models of existing document formats. A user study further investigates the user experience when creating and navigating cross-document hyperlinks.},

It is used in particular in the field of humanities and social sciences. This technique is usually applied by hand with pen and paper as support. However, as any combination of words in the raw text may be considered as an association or opposition relationship, applying the technique by hand in a readable way can quickly prove overwhelming for the analyst. In this paper, we propose Evoq, an application that provides support to structural analysts in their work. Furthermore, we present interactive visualizations representing the relationships between terms. These visualizations help create alternative representations of text, as advocated by structural analysts. We conducted two usability evaluations that showed great potential for Evoq as a structural analysis support tool and for the use of alternative representations of texts in the analysis.},

abstract = {The E-marketplace is a common place where entities situated in different contexts conduct business electronically. Since sellers and buyers may be located in areas with different languages, customs and even business standards, business documents may be heterogeneously edited and parsed in different contexts. However, so far, no desirable approaches have been implemented to transfer a document from one context to another without generating ambiguity and disputes may arise due to different interpretation towards to the same document. Thus, it is important to guarantee consistent understanding among different contexts. This paper proposes a cross-context semantic document exchange approach, Tabdoc approach, as a novel strategy in implementing semantic interoperability. It guarantees consistent business document understanding and realizes automatic cross-context document processing. The experimental results demonstrate promising performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Document editing has migrated in the last decade from a mostly individual activity to a shared activity among multiple persons. The World Wide Web and other communication means have contributed to this evolution. However, collaboration via the web has shown a tendency to centralize information, making it accessible to subsequent uses and abuses, such as surveillance, marketing, and data theft.Traditionally, access control policies have been enforced by a central authority, usually the server hosting the content, a single point of failure. We describe a novel scheme for collaborative editing in which clients enforce access control through the use of strong encryption. Encryption keys are distributed as the portion of a URI which is not shared with the server, enabling users to adopt a variety of document security workflows. This system separates access to the information ("the key") from the responsibility of hosting the content ("the carrier of the vault"), allowing privacy-conscious editors to enjoy a modern collaborative editing experience without relaxing their requirements.The paper presents CryptPad, an open-source reference implementation which features a variety of editors which employ the described access control methodology. We will detail approaches for implementing a variety of features required for user productivity in a manner that satisfies user-defined privacy concerns.},

Query expansion techniques leveraging entity recognition, alphanumeric term identification, and intent classification were implemented and studied using real enterprise content and query logs. They were evaluated against a set of test queries derived from relevance survey results using standard relevancy metrics such as normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG). Each of these modules produced meaningful and statistically significant improvements in relevancy.},

abstract = {SlideDiff is a system that automatically creates an animated rendering of textual and media differences between two versions of a slide presentation. While previous work focused on either textual or image data, SlideDiff integrates both text and media changes, as well as their interactions, for example when adding an image forces nearby text boxes to shrink. Given two versions of a slide (not the full history of edits), SlideDiff detects the textual and image differences, and then animates the changes by mimicking what a user might have done, such as moving the cursor, typing text, resizing image boxes, adding images. This editing metaphor is well known to most users, helping them better understand what has changed, and fosters a sense of connection between remote workers, derived from communicating both the revision process as well as its results. After detection of text and image differences, the animations are rendered in HTML and CSS, including mouse cursor motion, text and image box selection and resizing, text deletion and insertion with its cursor. We discuss strategies for animating changes, in particular the importance of starting with large changes and finishing with smaller edits, and provide details of the implementation using modern HTML and CSS.},

The JedAI Record Linkage toolkit is employed for most of the record linkage pipeline tasks (i.e. preprocessing, scalable feature representation, blocking and clustering) and the OpenCalais platform for entity extraction. The resulting clusters are evaluated with multiple clustering quality metrics. The experiments show very good clustering results and significant speedups in the clustering process, which indicates the suitability of both the record linkage formulation and the JedAI toolkit for improving the scalability for large-scale document clustering tasks.},

abstract = {Automatic document segmentation gets more and more attention in the natural language processing field. The problem is defined as text division into lexically coherent fragments. In fact, most of realistic documents are not homogeneous, so extracting underlying structure might increase performance of various algorithms in problems like topic recognition, document summarization, or document categorization. At the same time recent advances in word embedding procedures accelerated development of various text mining methods. Models such as word2vec, or GloVe allow for efficient learning a representation of large textual datasets and thus introduce more robust measures of word similarities. This study proposes a new document segmentation algorithm combining the idea of embedding-based measure of relation between words with Helmholtz Principle for text mining. We compare two of the most common word embedding models and show improvement of our approach on a benchmark dataset.},

Generally, the current literature concentrates efforts in structuring knowledge by identifying semantic entities in the data. In this paper, we test our hypothesis that hyperknowledge specifications are capable of defining rich relations among documents and extracted facts. The main evidence supporting this hypothesis is the fact that hyperknowledge was built on top of hypermedia fundamentals, easing the specification of rich relationships between different multimodal components (i.e. multimedia content and knowledge entities). The key challenge tackled in this paper is how to structure and correlate these components considering their meaning and semantic relations.},

abstract = {Citation analysis is considered as major and one of the most popular branches of bibliometrics. Citation analysis is based on the assumption that all citations have similar values and weights each equally. Specific research fields like content-based citation analysis (CCA) seeks to explain the "how" and "why" of citation behavior. In this paper we tackle to explain the "how" from a centrality indicator based on factors which are built automatically according to the authors' citation behavior. This indicator allows to evaluate bibliographical references' importance for reading the paper with which user interacts. From objective quantitative measurements, factors are computed in order to characterize the level of granularity where citations are used. By the setting of the centrality indicator's factors we can highlight citations which tend towards a partial or a global construction of the authors' discourse. We carry out a pilot study in which we test our approach on some papers and discuss the challenges in carrying out the citation analysis in this context. Our results show interesting and consistent correlations between the level of granularity and the significance of citation influences.},

abstract = {Each day, a vast amount of data is published on the web. In addition, the rate at which content is being published is growing, which has the potential to overwhelm users, particularly those who are technically unskilled. Furthermore, users from various domains of expertise face challenges when trying to retrieve the data they require. They may rely on IT experts, but these experts have limited knowledge of individual domains, making data extraction a time-consuming and error-prone task. It would be beneficial if domain experts were able to retrieve needed data and create relatively complex queries on top of web documents. The existing query solutions either are limited to a specific domain or require beginning with a predefined knowledge base or sample ontologies. To address these limitations, we propose a goal-oriented platform that enables users to easily extract data from web documents. This platform enables users to express their goals in natural language, after which the platform elicits the corresponding result type using the algorithm proposed. The platform also applies the concept of ontology to semantically improve search results. To retrieve the most relevant results from web documents, the segments of a user's query are mapped to the entities of the ontology. Two types of ontologies are used: goal ontologies and domain-specific ones, which comprise domain concepts and the relationships among them. In addition, the platform helps domain experts to generate the domain ontologies that will be used to extract data from web documents. Placing ontologies at the center of the approach integrates a level of semantics into the platform, resulting in more-precise output. The main contributions of this research are that it provides a goal-oriented platform for extracting data from web documents and integrates ontology-based development into web-document searches.},

Now, these interactions are rapidly moving to web- and phone-based chat systems. While converting traditional telephone dialogues to chat is relatively straightforward, converting forms to conversational interfaces can be challenging. In this work, we introduce methods and interfaces to enable the conversion of PDF and web-based documents that solicit user input into chat-based dialogues. Document data is first extracted to associate fields and their textual descriptions using metadata and lightweight visual analysis. The field labels, their spatial layout, and associated text are further analyzed to group related fields into natural conversational units. These correspond to questions presented to users in chat interfaces to solicit information needed to complete the original documents and downstream processes they support. This user supplied data can be inserted into the source documents and/or in downstream databases. User studies of our tool show that it streamlines form-to-chat conversion and produces conversational dialogues of at least the same quality as a purely manual approach.},
