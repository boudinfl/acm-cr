abstract = {There is an urgent need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility, but the difficulties in making bench-to-bedside translations have been well described. The nascent field of translational bioinformatics may help. Dr. Butte's lab at Stanford builds and applies tools that convert more than a trillion points of molecular, clinical, and epidemiological data - measured by researchers and clinicians over the past decade - into diagnostics, therapeutics, and new insights into disease. Dr. Butte, a bioinformatician and pediatric endocrinologist, will highlight his lab's work on using publicly-available molecular measurements to find new uses for drugs including drug repositioning for inflammatory bowel disease, discovering new treatable inflammatory mechanisms of disease in type 2 diabetes, and the evaluation of patients presenting with whole genomes sequenced.},

abstract = {The growth of medical and clinical textual datasets has fostered research interests in methods for storing, retrieving and extracting of pertinent data. In more recent years, shared tasks and more comprehensive data sharing agreements have seen a further growth in the research area spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) to aid the world of healthcare. Frequently NLP applications such as Medical Entity Recognition (MER), are motivated within the context of improving IR system performance. In this paper, we investigate the application of MER to a clinical retrieval system in the context of shared tasks in the respective areas. Namely, we aim to add structure to previously unstructured clinical reports and query sets. We evaluate the performance of MER on the query set, highlighting issues in constructing queries in a clinical setting. Further to this, we evaluate the performance of structuring queries on a retrieval dataset. We find that while structuring queries improves performance on complex queries that contain many term dependencies, there is a larger issue of linguistic variation found in clinical texts that must also be addressed.},

abstract = {Clinicians and researchers using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often search for, extract, and analyze groups of patients by defining a Health Outcome of Interest (HOI), which may include a set of diseases, conditions, signs, or symptoms. In our work on pharmacovigilance using clinical notes, for example, we use a method that operates over many (potentially hundreds) of ontologies at once, expands the input query, and increases the search space over clinical text as well as structured data. This method requires specifying an initial set of seed concepts, based on concept unique identifiers from the UMLS Metathesaurus. In some cases, such as for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, the seed query is easy to specify, but in other cases this task can be more subtle and requires manual-intensive work, such as for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The challenge in defining an HOI arises because medical and health terminologies are numerous and complex. We have developed a method consisting of a cooperation between Semantic Query Expansion, to leverage the hierarchical structure of ontologies, and Formal Concept Analysis, to organize, reason, and prune discovered concepts in an efficient manner over a large number of ontologies. Together, they assist the user, through a RESTful API and a web-based graphical user interface, in defining their seed query and in refining the expanded search space that it encompasses. In this context, end-user interactions mainly consist in accepting or rejecting system propositions and can be ceased on the user's will. We use this approach for text-mining clinical notes from EHRs, but they are equally applicable for cohort building tools in general. A preliminary evaluation of this work, on the i2b2 Obesity NLP reference set, emphasizes positive results for sensitivity and specificity measures which are slightly improving existing results on this gold standard. This experimentation also highlights that our semi-automatic approach provides fast processing times (in the order of milliseconds to few seconds) for the generation of several thousands of potential terms. The most promising aspect of this approach is the discovery of potentially positive results from false negative concepts discovered by our method. In future works, we aim to conduct user driven evaluation of the Web interface, analyze the acceptance/rejection of physicians in several practical scenarios and use active learning over past query refinements to improve future queries.},

abstract = {To save time, healthcare providers frequently use abbreviations while authoring clinical documents. Nevertheless, abbreviations that authors deem unambiguous often confuse other readers, including clinicians, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems. Most current clinical NLP systems "post-process" notes long after clinicians enter them into electronic health record systems (EHRs). Such post-processing cannot guarantee 100% accuracy in abbreviation identification and disambiguation, since multiple alternative interpretations exist. In this paper, authors describe a prototype system for real-time Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD) -- i.e., a system that interacts with authors during note generation to verify correct abbreviation senses. The CARD system design anticipates future integration with web-based clinical documentation systems to improve quality of healthcare records. The prototype application embodies three word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods. We evaluated the accuracy and response times of the prototype CARD system in a simulated study. Using an existing test data set of 25 commonly observed, highly ambiguous clinical abbreviations the evaluation demonstrated that the best WSD method had an accuracy of 88.8%, and a reasonable average response time of 1.6 milliseconds per each abbreviation. The study indicates potential feasibility of real-time NLP-enabled abbreviation disambiguation within clinical documentation systems.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a set of studies designed to identify sublanguages in documents for domain-specific processing across institutions. Psychological evidence indicates that humans use context-specific linguistic information when they read. Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines are successful within specific domains (i.e., contexts). To limit the number of domain-specific NLP systems, a natural focus would be on sublanguages. Sublanguages are identified by shared lexical and semantic features.[1] Patterson and Hurdle[2] developed a sublanguage identification system that functioned well for 12 clinical specialties at the University of Utah. The current work compares sublanguages across institutions. Using a clinical NLP pipeline augmented by a new document corpus from the University of Pittsburg (UPitt), new documents were assigned to clusters based on the minimum cosine-distance to a Utah cluster centroid. The UPitt documents were divided into a nine-group specialty corpus. Across institutions, five of the specialty groups fell within the expected clusters. We find that clustering encounters difficulty due to documents with mixed sublanguages; naming convention differences across institutions; and document types used across specialties. The findings indicate that clinical specialty sublanguages can be identified across institutions.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a new local binding site search system, called Fast Patch-Surfer, for extending previous work, Patch-Surfer. Patch-Surfer efficiently retrieves top-k similar proteins based on new representation of proteins capturing features of their local ligand-binding site and newly defined distance function. However, further speed up is needed since in practical setting of computing dissimilarity between proteins, there are possibilities for simultaneous multiple user access on the database. We address this need for further speed up in local ligand-binding site search by exploiting landmark MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS), which is an efficient version of MDS being popularly used for representing high-dimensional dataset. According to the result, using our method, the searching time is reduced up to 99%, and it retrieves almost 80% of exact top-k results.},

abstract = {The advent of resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology has made it possible to classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) states based on the quantitative activity indices of brain regions. Current connectivity-based classification techniques suffer from limited reproducibility due to the need for prior knowledge on discriminative brain regions and intrinsic heterogeneity in the course of AD progression. Actually, similar challenges have been already addressed in molecular bioinformatics communities. They have achieved higher and reproducible classification accuracy and have identified interpretable markers by incorporating molecular pathway information in their classification. We have adopted a similar strategy to the RS-fMRI-based AD classification problem. After collecting various functional brain pathways from literature, we have quantified which pathways show significantly different activity levels between AD patients and healthy subjects. Moreover, discriminatory pathways between AD patients and healthy subjects may facilitate the interpretation of functional alterations in the course of AD progression.},

Our optimizations include sufficient statistics, variable preselection, hash tables and calling a linear algebra library. We present experiments with very high dimensional microarray data sets to predict cancer survival time. We discuss encouraging findings, identifying specific genes likely to predict the survival time for brain cancer patients.

abstract = {Multi-compound drugs are considered as the most promising solution to overcome the limited efficacy and off-target effect of drugs. However, identifying promising multiple compounds by experimental tests requires overwhelming costs and a number of tests. Systems biology-based approaches are regarded as one of the most promising strategy. To predict responses of drugs in biological systems is one of aims of Systems biology.We made Bio-Synergy Modeling Language (BSML) for modeling biological systems, which are multi-scale systems. BSML contains context information that covers spatial scales, temporal scales, and condition information, such as disease. We have applied BSML to generate type 2 diabetes (T2D) model, which involves malfunctions of numerous organs such as pancreas, liver, and muscle. We have extracted 12,522 T2D-related rules from public databases automatically. We simulated responses of single drugs and combination drugs on the T2D model by Petri nets. The results of our simulation show candidate T2D drugs and how combination drugs could act on whole-body scales. We expect that our work would provide an insight for identifying promising combination drugs and mechanisms of combination drugs on whole body scales.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic and phenotypic evidences indicate that breast and prostate cancers have high pathological similarities. Analysis of pathological similarities between cancers can be beneficial in several aspects such as enabling the knowledge transfer between the cancer studies. To gain knowledge of the similarity between the breast and prostate cancer pathology, common genes that are affected by the two carcinomas are investigated. Gene expression data extracted from RNA-seq experiments, provided through TCGA consortium, is used for gene selection. Gene selection was performed using an iterative SVM based ensemble feature selection approach. Iterative SVM-based gene selection methods enable correlated gene expressions to be considered simultaneously and ensemble approach stabilizes the selection. As results of the analysis, two genes, Transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) and complement component 4A (C4A), were selected as commonly altered genes. Direct relationships of the two genes to the two cancers are not confirmed. However, TGM4 is known to be associated with adenocarcinomas and C4A with ovarian cancer. Thus provides evidence that they maybe pathologically important genes for the two cancers.},
