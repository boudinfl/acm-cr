abstract = {The Entity Linking (EL) task links entity mentions from an unstructured document to entities in a knowledge base. Although this problem is well-studied in news and social media, this problem has not received much attention in the life science domain. One outcome of tackling the EL problem in the life sciences domain is to enable scientists to build computational models of biological processes with more efficiency. However, simply applying a news-trained entity linker produces inadequate results. Since existing supervised approaches require a large amount of manually-labeled training data, which is currently unavailable for the life science domain, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to link entities from unstructured full texts of biomedical literature to 300 ontologies. The approach leverages the rich semantic information and structures in ontologies for similarity computation and entity ranking.Without using any manual annotation, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EL method (9% absolute gain in linking accuracy). Furthermore, the state-of-the-art supervised EL method requires 15,000 manually annotated entity mentions for training. These promising results establish a benchmark for the EL task in the life science domain1. We also provide in depth analysis and discussion on both challenges and opportunities on automatic knowledge enrichment for scientific literature.In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to address the EL problem in a new domain. We show that our unsupervised approach is able to outperform a current state-of-the-art supervised approach that has been trained with a large amount of manually labeled data. Life science presents an underrepresented domain for applying EL techniques. By providing a small benchmark data set and identifying opportunities, we hope to stimulate discussions across natural language processing and bioinformatics and motivate others to develop techniques for this largely untapped domain.},

abstract = {The biomedical information extraction, especially Named Entity Recognition (NER), is a primary task in biomedical text-mining due to the rapid growth of large-scale literature. Extracting biomedical entities aims at identifying specific entities (words or phrases) from those unstructured text data. In this work, we introduce a novel biomedical NER system utilizing a combination of regional and global text features: linguistic, lexical, contextual, and syntactic features. Our system adopts Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [1] as a machine learning algorithm and consists of two major pipelines (see Figure 1). We especially focus on constructing the first pipeline for text processing in a modularized manner and discovering rich feature sets regarding comprehensive linguistics and contexts. To implement the CRF framework in the second pipeline, our system uses a modified version of Mallet [2] to take advantage of feature induction. As a result of 10-fold cross-validation, our system achieves from 0.99% up to 18.47% of F-measure improvement as well as the highest precision compared to existing open-source biomedical NER systems on GENETAG corpus [3]. We figure out that several components such as abundant key features, external resources, and feature induction contribute to the performance of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Description of a patient's injuries is recorded in narrative text form by hospital emergency departments. For statistical reporting, this text data needs to be mapped to pre-defined codes. Existing research in this field uses the Na\"{\i}ve Bayes probabilistic method to build classifiers for mapping. In this paper, we focus on providing guidance on the selection of a classification method. We build a number of classifiers belonging to different classification families such as decision tree, probabilistic, neural networks, and instance-based, ensemble-based and kernel-based linear classifiers. An extensive pre-processing is carried out to ensure the quality of data and, in hence, the quality classification outcome. The records with a null entry in injury description are removed. The misspelling correction process is carried out by finding and replacing the misspelt word with a soundlike word. Meaningful phrases have been identified and kept, instead of removing the part of phrase as a stop word. The abbreviations appearing in many forms of entry are manually identified and only one form of abbreviations is used. Clustering is utilised to discriminate between non-frequent and frequent terms. This process reduced the number of text features dramatically from about 28,000 to 5000.The medical narrative text injury dataset, under consideration, is composed of many short documents. The data can be characterized as high-dimensional and sparse, i.e., few features are irrelevant but features are correlated with one another. Therefore, Matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) have been used to map the processed feature space to a lower-dimensional feature space. Classifiers with these reduced feature space have been built.In experiments, a set of tests are conducted to reflect which classification method is best for the medical text classification. The Non Negative Matrix Factorization with Support Vector Machine method can achieve 93% precision which is higher than all the tested traditional classifiers. We also found that TF/IDF weighting which works well for long text classification is inferior to binary weighting in short document classification. Another finding is that the Top-n terms should be removed in consultation with medical experts, as it affects the classification performance.},

abstract = {Interactions between biological entities such as genes, proteins and metabolites, so called pathways, are key features to understand molecular mechanisms of life. As pathway information is being accumulated rapidly through various knowledge resources, there are growing interests in maintaining integrity of the heterogeneous databases. Here, we defined conflict as a status where two contradictory evidences (i.e. 'A increases B' and 'A decreases B') coexist in a same pathway. This conflict damages unity so that inference of simulation on the integrated pathway network might be unreliable. We defined rule and rule group. A rule consists of interaction of two entities, meta-relation (increase or decrease), and contexts terms about tissue specificity or environmental conditions. The rules, which have the same interaction, are grouped into a rule group. If the rules don't have unanimous meta-relation, the rule group and the rules are judged as being conflicting. This analysis revealed that almost 20% of known interactions suffer from conflicting information and conflicting information occurred much more frequently in the literatures than the public database. With consideration for dual functions depending on context, we thought it might resolve conflict to consider context. We grouped rules, which have the same context terms as well as interaction. It's revealed that up to 86% of the conflicts could be resolved by considering context. Subsequent analysis also showed that those contradictory records generally compete each other closely, but some information might be suspicious when their evidence levels are seriously imbalanced. By identifying and resolving the conflicts, we expect that pathway databases can be cleaned and used for better secondary analyses such as gene/protein annotation, network dynamics and qualitative/quantitative simulation.},

The potential of our method is demonstrated by showing better performance against the previous methods to predict known disease relations of E3. We could discover 101 E3s and their functional network having 1,285 relations with diseases.

abstract = {It has been reported that several brain diseases could share symptoms at clinical level, suggesting the necessity and possibility to develop therapeutics. In this paper, we carried out an integrated gene expression analysis on several microarray datasets of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders to discover the uniqueness and commonness in their molecular basis. First, we selected and combined three sets of microarray data including eight brain diseases. Second, we applied a correlation-based biclustering approach, BICLIC [1], to efficiently identify coexpressed gene modules that are correlated in individual or multiple combinations of brain diseases. Third, Gene ontology-based functional enrichment analysis is performed to analyze functional characteristics of the identified cross-disease or and disease-specific modules. In this approach, we could examine various sets of correlated genes significantly in both single and multiple diseases. As a result, in total, 4,307 coexpressed gene modules were turned out to be common to two or more of brain diseases. Among them, eight modules having different combinations of total 16 genes were involved correlatively in more than seven brain diseases. The functional analysis showed that the multi-disease specific modules were more associated to higher brain functions like cognitive functions than single disease specific modules. The results in this study provide valuable resources to further investigate the key molecular players affecting on brain diseases in both transnosological or disease specific manner.},

According to the predictive power of clinical features and survival time of the identified subtypes, the binary somatic mutation profile with Jaccard distance (B-Jac) performed the best and the weighted somatic mutation profile with Euclidean distance (W-Euc) performed comparably. Both approaches performed significantly better than the typical usage of somatic mutation, i.e. the binary somatic mutation profile with Euclidean distance (B-Euc).},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a comprehensive analysis of the genomic features of the human in mutations to classify loss-of-function (LoF) and gain-of-function (GoF) mutations. Through these genetic mutations, a protein can lose its native function, or it can confer a new function. However, when a mutation occurs, it is difficult to determine whether it will result in a LoF or a GoF. Therefore, we propose a study that analyzes the human genomic features of LoF and GoF instances to find features that can be used to classify LoF and GoF mutations. In order to collect experimentally verified LoF and GoF mutational information, we obtained 816 LoF mutations and 474 GoF mutations from a literature text-mining process. Next, with data-preprocessing steps, 258 LoF and 129 GoF mutations remained for a further analysis. We analyzed the properties of these LoF and GoF mutations. Among the properties, we selected features which show different tendencies between the two groups. Finally, we implemented classifications using support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression methods to confirm whether or not these features can identify LoF and GoF mutations. By implementing classifications with the selected features, it is demonstrated that the selected features have good discriminative power.},

In this study, we identify the genomic differences between 96 E. coli ST131 strains and the E. coli K-12 in gene elements and their non-coding regulation elements. Using next-generation whole-genome sequencing data, we investigated genetic variations of protein-coding regions and their regulation regions. After the alignment of the sequence reads, large numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were observed in the regulation and protein-coding sequences. In the regulation regions, we found strong conserved regions, in this case, ribosome binding sites. In the gene regions, we found conserved start and stop codons with the specific position varying commonly in each codon. Except for these well-conserved regions, other variations were randomly distributed in regulation regions. Even a region having well-known conserved sequences such as -10 and -35 in the promoter had a similar level of variation. In this study, we found genomic variations between the pathogenic E. coli ST 131 strain and the non-pathogenic E. coli K-12. In addition, the numbers of sequence variations were determined in both the protein-coding regions and the regulation regions. However, we found that the effects of variations on the protein-coding regions are less significant than those on the regulation regions.},

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to extracting relations based on a rule-based approach feature set. We then use different classification algorithms such as SVM, Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers for relation classification. The rationale for adopting shallow parsing and other NLP techniques to extract relations is two-folds: simplicity and robustness. We select seven features with the rule-based shallow parsing technique and evaluate the performance with four different PPI public corpora. Our experimental results show the stable performance in F-measure even with the relatively fewer features.},

Co-location networks for CT and AR are analyzed using network features, visualization, and highly-ranked betweenness centrality nodes. The analysis results reveal that the CT network is more densely compact with about twice as many nodes than the AR network. According to the analysis at the national level, the AR network is rather focused on the United States while the CT network is more spread out throughout the world. At the city level, the collaborative work is more active among closely located cities in the AR network compared to the case of the CT network (see Figure 1). The AR network has core collaboration centers mainly situated in the United States and Europe, but those of the CT network also includes Asian and African cities. Overall, our study intuitively points out the differences in the collaborative networks for CT and AR, which contributes to the understanding of the research trend involving the productivity analysis of the collaborative work associated with the regional aspect.},

abstract = {Biomedical literature from PubMed contains various types of entities such as diseases or organisms. The rapid growth of their size makes it harder to conceptualized; however, displaying the natural terms that occurred in the text is more effective in understanding the target corpus to be searched than suggesting a concept related to a user query. Thus, we consider the natural common words that biomedical information users actually write and speak. We extract bio-related terms from the corpus mapping with the UMLS. We show entity-based networks with natural language terms as they are shown in the text. In this paper, we present simple and precise associative networks of natural terms in the biomedical literature. The entity-based networks and entity relations can make understanding the biomedical literature corpus more effective and easier by detecting related terms and their hidden relations in the documents. We considered bio-entities and their relations in the biomedical literature and focused on the representation of a graphic display that can improve users' perception about a large corpus. To this end, epidemiology as an experimental domain was chosen and we extract entities from the corpus mapping the UMLS and draw their relations inferred by the Semantic Network of the UMLS. Then we calculate term frequencies, co-occurrences, and term pair similarities (See Figure 1). In results, distinguished networks that display conceptual structures in the biomedical literature with a natural language and not a concept were demonstrated (See Figure 2). The networks we present provide more comprehension of the biomedical collection.},

abstract = {Due to the recent development of Information Technology, the number of publications is increasing exponentially. In response to the increasing number of publications, there has been a sharp surge in the demand for replacing the existing manual text data processing by an automatic text data processing. Swanson proposed ABC model [1] on the top of text mining as a part of literature-based knowledge discovery for finding new possible biomedical hypotheses about three decades ago. The following clinical scholars proved the effectiveness of the possible hypotheses found by ABC model [2]. Such effectiveness let scholars try various literature-based knowledge discovery approaches [3, 4, 5]. However, their trials are not fully automated but hybrids of automatic and manual processes. The manual process requires the intervention of experts. In addition, their trials consider a single perspective. Even trials involving network theory have difficulties in mal-understanding the entire network structure of the relationships among concepts and the systematic interpretation on the structure [6, 7]. Thus, this study proposes a novel approach to discover various relationships by extending the intermediate concept B to a multi-leveled concept. By applying a graph-based path finding method based on co-occurrence and the relational entities among concepts, we attempt to systematically analyze and investigate the relationships between two concepts of a source node and a target node in the total paths. For the analysis of our study, we set our baseline as the result of Swanson [8]'s work. This work suggested the intermediate concept or terms between Raynaud's disease and fish oils as blood viscosity, platelet aggregability, and vasconstriction. We compared our results of intermediate concepts with these intermediate concepts of Swanson's. This study provides distinct perspectives for literature-based discovery by not only discovering the meaningful relationship among concepts in biomedical literature through graph-based path interference but also being able to generate feasible new hypotheses.},

abstract = {These days, social media usually becomes a reasonable standard for understanding the public's thought. Especially, people increasingly use internet media and SNS (twitter, facebook, blog, and etc.), to share opinions, news, advice, interests, moods, concerns, critics, facts, rumors, and everything. Therefore, public health research has been started a big change. Traditional public health study has depended on only regular clinical reports by health professionals. It is limited to practical use and general public has much difficulty to understand health information, even if it's his/her own information. Nowadays, over one billion people publish their ideas about many topics, including health conditions minute by minute. SNS provides researchers the freshest source of public health conditions on a global scale. Much of that data is public and available for mining. So this article pursues making an application of opinion mining for detecting the public's trend and finding valuable opinion among the massive information. The core of this research is analyzing the adjective of opinions. Our assumption is that many adjective expressions implicate deep and sincere meaning of its author. It is applicable for both low value postings filtering and tracking high value postings simultaneously. This approach is a simple and feasible criteria. The opinion mining process includes Korean morpheme analysis, opinion extraction, opinion tagging, positive / negative score evaluation. Our research's aim is to analyze Korean blog postings.},

abstract = {Natural products used in dietary supplements, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine are composites of multiple chemical compounds. These chemical compounds potentially offer an extensive source for drug discovery with accumulated knowledge of efficacy and safety. However, existing natural product related databases have drawbacks in both standardization and structuralization of information. Therefore, in this work, we construct an integrated database of natural products by mapping the prescription, herb, compound, and phenotype information to international identifiers and structuralizing the efficacy information through database integration and text-mining methods. We expect that the constructed database could serve as a fundamental resource for the natural products research.},

abstract = {Computer-based virtual human model is believed to be the promising solution for drug response identification. Literature mining is competitive method to extract those biological rules for human model simulation, since existing public databases provide only limited amount of information applicable for the simulation. Here we propose the method for mining context-specific rules from the literature, for future application to virtual human model simulation. Integrating the existing biological databases, we have constructed formalized ontology. From the PubMed literature, we have tagged 11 distinct types of biological entities using both of conditional random field (CRF) and dictionary based Named Entity Recognition (NER). Recognized named entities were normalized and mapped to formalized ontology. Context-specific biological rules between named entities, characterized by increase/decrease features, were extracted by pattern-based method utilizing regular expression. As the result, we have obtained the organ-context specific biological rules. Further researches on enhanced rule and context extraction will be followed.},

For such tools zooming is a key method for visualizing large and complex network in a single view[1].

So we developed the zoomable visualization system for the large bio-molecule network without preformed hierarchy data.},

abstract = {Inferring drug-induced phenotypes via computational approaches can give a substantial support to drug discovery procedure. However, existing computational models that are mainly based on a single cell or a single organ model are thought to be limited because the phenotypes are consequences of stochastic biochemical processes among distant cells/organs as well as molecules confined in one cell. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for a new computational model that represents heterogeneous biochemical interactions spanning the entire human body. To meet the demand, we constructed multi-level networks that incorporate previously uncovered high-level properties such as molecules, cells, organs, and phenotypes. Currently, the networks consist of 1,776,506 edges including molecular networks within 76 pre-defined cell-types, inter-cell interactions among the cell-types, and gene (protein) relations to 429 phenotypes. We are also planning to verify if known drug-induced phenotypes are reproducible in the networks using a Petri-net based simulation.},

abstract = {Motivation: In recent disease study, many key pathogen genes/proteins are found to have not significant differential expressions, and thus, they tend to be disregarded in conventional differential expression analysis or network analysis. Meanwhile, the activity in dry-experiment rather than expression in wet-experiment have been proposed to effectively estimate the actual regulation power of such important biomolecules, e.g. transcriptional factors. But, it is still unknown what and how a hidden factor (e.g. phosphorylation) determines this kind of virtual regulation power as activity [1]. Especially, for the cancer development study, it is emergent to reconstruct the active protein interaction network and detect the underlying phosphorylation pattern in a dynamic manner [2-7]. Methods: Based on the c-Myc mouse model of liver cancer, we have first collected protein expression and protein phosphorylation data at several developmental time points. Then, we constructed a rough protein interaction network as background by conditional mutual information. Next, we improved the conventional network component analysis on its robustness, and used this advanced approach RNCA (Robust Network Component Analysis) to reconstruct the time-dependent protein interaction networks and estimate the activity of target protein at different times simultaneously. Finally, considering the different experiment-qualities of protein expression and phosphorylation data, we used canonical correlation analysis to detect the maximal correlation between the expression and phosphorylation of a group of proteins (e.g. protein network module), which could reveal the active protein sub-network and its determinate factor as phosphorylation. Results: In the preliminary study, we have evaluated the robustness of RNCA by comparing with other conventional methods. And on the real biological data, we have found the rewired protein interaction network during cancer development, its corresponding active proteins, and their drivers as protein phosphorylation. This work can be further used in early diagnosis of diseases by edge biomarkers [1-2], network biomarkers [3-4] and dynamical network biomarkers [5-7].},

abstract = {After genome project in 1990s, researches which are involved with gene have been progressed. These studies unearthed that gene is cause of disease, and relations between gene and disease are important. In this reason, we proposed a strategy called TILD that identifies cancer-related genes using title information in literature data. To implement our method, we selected cancer-specific literature data from the online database. We then extracted genes using text mining. In the next step, we classified into two kinds for extracted genes using title information. If genes are located in title, then they are classified as hub genes. In the contrast, if genes are located in body, then they are classified as sub genes which are connected with hub genes. We iterated the processes for each paper to construct the cancer-specific local gene network. In the last step, we constructed global cancer-specific gene network by integrating all local gene network, and calculated a score for each gene based on analysis of the global gene network. We assumed that genes in title have meaningful relations with cancer, and other genes in the body are related with the title genes. For validation, we compared with other methods for the top 20 genes inferred by each approach. Our approach found more cancer-related genes than comparable methods.},
