abstract = {We are building the Pharmacogenetics &amp; Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB, http://www.pharmgkb.org/) with the goal of cataloguing all knowledge about how genetic variation impacts drug response phenotypes. PharmGKB stores primary data (genotype and phenotype data) as well as more distilled knowledge in the form of pathway diagrams, annotated summaries of very important pharmacogenes (VIP genes), and annotated literature. The literature annotation efforts include both manual curation by trained curators and automatic information extraction. In this talk, I will discuss three projects relevant to our efforts in literature curation:1. The Pharmspresso project is a simple rule-based system for extracting mentions of gene, drug, disease and polymorphism interactions from text. It is based on the Textpresso system developed at Caltech, but adds specific rules about human drugs, genes and phenotypes. The initial version of Pharmspresso had good performance, but suffered from false positive extractions, and so we have been working to improve the performance, while maintaining as much generality as possible. Pharmspresso is available athttp://pharmspresso.stanford.edu/2. The PGxPipeline project builds on the gene-drug-disease associations mined both manually and automatically to do scientific discovery. A critical bottleneck in pharmacogenetics is identifying genes that are likely to be important for modifying drug response. Unless the full details of drug action and metabolism are understood, any of the ~25,000 human genes could be important for understanding action and metabolism. PgxPipeline is built to accept as input a drug and an indication for use (e.g. pain or high cholesterol). It then uses both information from the literature as well as information about chemical structure to rank order all genes in the human genome with respect to the likelihood that they interact with the drug of interest. In this way, we can prioritize the genes that are most likely to be relevant to the drug. We have found that our rank order lists are useful adjuncts to other independent sources of information, and work best in combination with these.3. Finally, we have been studying the sites in proteins that bind small molecules (such as drugs) or are important as active sites where the proteins' functions occur. We have clustered these sites based on structural similarity to discover new structural motifs associated with protein function. Very often, we have no knowledge of the function of these newly discovered structural motifs, but the literature often has substantial information about the function of the proteins to which these motifs belong. Our final project, then, is focused on gathering the literature associated with proteins that have a common motif, and determining what words/concepts are likely to describe the common functions of these proteins, and therefore be the likely significance of these shared structural motifs.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need of complementing the information available for the analysis of biological systems in Systems Biology and Genomics projects. A need that makes interesting the integration of information directly extracted from textual sources using Information Extraction and Text Mining approaches. My group has been working in developing Text Mining approaches and in their integration in large-scale projects together with other experimental and bioinformatics methods. In this occasion I will present the developments related with the characterization of the human mitotic spindle apparatus, developed in the context of the ENFIN NoE. For these, and other, applications it is crucial to have an accurate estimation of the capacity of the current Text Mining systems. The BioCreative II challenge organized by CNIO, MITRE and NCBI in collaboration with the MINT and INTACT databases (http://biocreative.sourceforge.net, Genome Biology, August 2008 Special Issue) provides such an overview. BioCreative II was in two task: 1) gene name identification and normalization, where many systems were able to achieve a consistent 80% balance precision / recall. And 2) protein interaction detection that was divided in four sub-tasks: a) ranking of publications by their relevance on experimental determination of protein interactions, b) detection of protein interaction partners in text, c) detection of key sentences describing protein interactions, and d) detection of the experimental technique used to determine the interactions. The results were quite good in the categories of publication raking, detection of experimental methods, and highlighting of relevant sentences, while they pointed to persistent problems in the correct normalization of gene/protein names. Furthermore BioCreative has channel the collaboration of several teams for the creation of the first Text Mining meta-server (The BioCreative Meta-server, Leitner et al., Genome Biology 2008 BioCreative special issue). We are working now in the preparation of BioCreative III, with particular focus in fostering the creation of Text Mining systems that can be integrated in Genome analysis pipelines, and contribute effectively to the understanding of complex Biological Systems.},

Due to the high dimensionality and small sample size that characterizes microarray data, there has recently been a drive to incorporate any available information in addition to the expression data in the classification process. As a result, much work has begun on selecting biological pathways that are closely related to a clinical outcome of interest using the gene expression data, and incorporating this pathway information opens up new avenues for classification. As opposed to previous approaches that consider individual genes as features, we propose a new approach that treats biological pathways as features. Each pathway found to be significantly related to an outcome of interest is treated as a feature, and is mapped to a feature value. We define several methods for mapping pathways to features, and compare the performance of several classifiers using our feature transformations to that of the classifiers using individual genes as features for different feature selection methods.},

abstract = {Microarray data sets contain expression levels of thousands of genes. The statistical analysis of such data sets is typically performed outside a DBMS with statistical packages or mathematical libraries. In this work, we focus on analyzing them inside the DBMS. This is a difficult problem because microarray data sets have high dimensionality, but small size. First, due to DBMS limitations on a maximum number of columns per table, the data set has to be pivoted and transformed before analysis. More importantly, the correlation matrix on tens of thousands of genes has millions of values. While most high dimensional data sets can be analyzed with the classical PCA method, small, but high dimensional, data sets can only be analyzed with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We adapt the Householder tridiagonalization and QR factorization numerical methods to solve SVD inside the DBMS. Since these mathematical methods require many matrix operations, which are hard to express in SQL, query optimizations and efficient UDFs are developed to get good performance. Our proposed techniques achieve processing times comparable with those from the R package, a well-known statistical tool. We experimentally show our methods scale well with high dimensionality.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in mining gene expression data is to identify how the expression of any particular gene affects the expression of other genes. To elucidate the relationships between genes, an association rule mining (ARM) method has been applied to microarray gene expression data. A conventional ARM method, however, has a limit on extracting temporal dependencies between genes, though the temporal information is indispensable to discover underlying regulation mechanisms in biological pathways. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel method, referred to as temporal association rule mining (TARM), which can extract temporal dependencies among related genes. A temporal association rule has the form [gene A ↑, gene B↓] → (7 min)[gene C], which represents that high expression level of gene A and significant repression of gene B followed by significant expression of gene C after 7 minutes. The proposed TARM method is tested with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle time-series microarray gene expression data set. In the parameter fitting phase of TARM, the best parameter set [threshold = ±0.8, support cutoff = 3 transactions, confidence cutoff = 90%], which extracted the most number of correct associations in KEGG cell cycle pathway, has been chosen for rule mining phase. Furthermore, comparing the precision scores of TARM (0.38) and Bayesian network (0.16), TARM method showed better accuracy. With the best parameter set, numbers of temporal association rules with five transcriptional time delays (0, 7, 14, 21, 28 minutes) are extracted from gene expression data of 799 genes which are pre-identified cell cycle relevant genes, while comparably small number of rules are extracted from random shuffled gene expression data of 799 genes. From the extracted temporal association rules, associated genes which play same role of biological processes within short transcriptional time delay and some temporal dependencies between genes with specific biological processes are identified.},

abstract = {Metastasis is the most dangerous step in cancer progression and causes more than 90% of cancer death. Although many researchers have been working on biological features and characteristics of metastasis, most of its genetic level processes remain uncertain. Some studies succeeded in elucidating metastasis related genes and pathways, followed by predicting prognosis of cancer patients, but there still is a question whether the result genes or pathways contain enough information and noise features have been controlled appropriately. To address these problems, we conducted comparisons between primary tumors and secondary metastatic tumors. Noises from the differences of tissue specific characteristics between two types of tumors have been controlled by additional analyses. In this paper, we suggest a new method for identifying genes and pathways which secure metastasis dependency and are free of metastasis independent features.},

abstract = {Functional prediction/classification of proteins is a central problem in bioinformatics. Alignment methods are a useful approach, but have limitations, which have prompted the development and use of machine learning approaches. However, traditional machine learning approaches are unable to exploit sequence data directly, and instead use derived sequence features or Kernel functions to obtain a feature space. Because theoretically all information necessary to predict a protein's structure and function is contained in its sequence, a methodology that could exploit sequence data directly could be advantageous. A novel machine learning methodology for protein classification, inspired in the concept of fragment programs, is presented. This methodology consists in assigning a minimal computer program to each of the 20 amino acids, and then representing a protein as the program resulting from applying sequentially the programs of the amino acids which compose its sequence. The basic concepts of the methodology presented (peptide programs) are discussed and a framework is proposed for their implementation, including instruction set, virtual machine, evaluation procedures and convergence methods. The methodology is tested in the binary classification of 33,500 enzymes into 182 distinct Enzyme Commission (EC) classes. The average Matthews correlation coefficient of the binary classifiers is 0.75 in training and 0.68 in validation. Overall, the results obtained demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology, and its ability to extract knowledge from sequence data, using very few computational resources},

Relevance model feedback of top ranked passages is used to improve distributional estimates of concepts and topics in context, and a dimensional indexing strategy is used for efficient aggregation of concept and term statistics. By integrating multiple sources of evidence including dependencies between topics, concepts, and terms, we seek to improve genomics literature passage retrieval precision. Using this model, we are able to demonstrate statistically significant improvements in retrieval precision using a large genomics literature corpus.},

Recently, a comparative study of pairwise statistical significance with database statistical significance was conducted.

Preliminary results for a knowledge discovery application such as homology detection reveal that using multiple parameter sets for pairwise statistical significance estimates gives significantly better coverage than using a single parameter set, at least at some error levels. Also, the fact that the performance does not degrade when using multiple parameter sets is a strong evidence that the assumption that the score distribution follows an extreme value distribution is valid even when using multiple parameter sets. Results of pairwise statistical significance using multiple parameter sets are further shown to be significantly better than database statistical significance estimates reported by BLAST and PSI-BLAST, and comparable and at times significantly better than SSEARCH.},

To this end, we strip this approach down to an algorithm that uses only a subset of the initial syntactic features. Next, we compare the original and the stripped-down method by evaluating them on 5 benchmark datasets as well as by performing 5 additional cross-dataset experiments. Although the original method exploits a very rich feature set including words, parts-of-speech and grammatical relations, it is not significantly better than the stripped-down version; in fact, the former does not even consistently outperform the latter.},

abstract = {Databases containing very large amounts of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data are now freely available for researchers interested in medical or population genetics applications. While many of these SNP repositories have implemented data retrieval tools for general purpose mining, these alone cannot cover the broad spectrum of needs of most medical and population genetics studies. To address this limitation, we propose building in-house customized data marts from the raw data provided by the largest public databases. In particular, for population genetics analysis based on genotypes we propose building a set of data processing scripts that would deal with raw data coming from the major SNP variation databases (e.g. HapMap, Perlegen) that can be stripped into single genotypes and then grouped into populations. This allows not only in-house standardization and normalization of the genotyping data retrieved from different repositories, but also the calculation of statistical indices from simple allele frequency estimates up to elaborate genetic differentiation tests within populations, together with the ability to combine population samples from different databases. This article describes the viability of implementing scripts for handling extensive datasets of SNP genotypes with low computational costs, and shows that the updating of these data marts is straightforward, permitting easy implementation of new external data and the computation of new statistical indices.},

We here present a method for exploring gene regulatory mechanisms which integrates various types of data to assist the identification of important components in gene regulation mechanisms. By first analyzing gene expression data, a set of differentially expressed genes is selected. These genes are then further investigated by combining various types of biological information, such as clustering results, promoter sequences, binding sites, transcription factors and other previously published information regarding the selected genes. Inspired by Information Fusion research, we also mapped functions of the proposed method to the well-known OODA-model to facilitate application of this data integration method in other research communities. We have successfully applied the method to genes identified as differentially expressed in human embryonic stem cells at different stages of differentiation towards cardiac cells. We identified 15 novel motifs that may represent important binding sites in the cardiac cell linage.},
