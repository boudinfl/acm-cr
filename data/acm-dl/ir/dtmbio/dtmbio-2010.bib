abstract = {Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with respect to molecular alterations and cellular composition making therapeutic and clinical outcome unpredictable. This diversity creates a significant challenge in developing tumor classifications that are clinically reliable with respect to prognosis prediction. This paper describes an unsupervised context analysis to infer context-specific gene regulatory networks from 1,614 samples obtained from publicly available gene expression data, an extension of previously published method. The main focus of the paper, however, is to use the context specific gene regulatory networks to classify the tumors into clinically relevant sub-groups and providing candidates for a finer sub-grouping of the previously known intrinsic tumors with focus on basal-like tumors. Further analysis of pathway enrichment of the key contexts provides an understanding of the biological mechanism for identified subtypes of breast cancers.},

abstract = {AIM Given a set of pre-defined medical categories used in Evidence Based Medicine, we aim to automatically annotate sentences in medical abstracts with these labels. METHOD We construct a corpus of 1,000 medical abstracts annotated by hand with medical categories (e.g. "Intervention", "Outcome"). We explore the use of various features based on lexical, semantic, structural, and sequential information in the data, using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for classification. RESULT For the classification tasks over all labels, our systems achieved micro-averaged F-scores of 80.9% and 66.9% in structured and unstructured datasets respectively, using sequential features. In labeling only key sentences, our systems produced F-scores of 89.3% and 74.0% in structured and unstructured datasets respectively, using the same sequential features. The results over an external dataset were lower (F-scores of 63.1% for all-labels, and 83.8% for key sentences). CONCLUSION Of the features we used, the best for classifying any given sentence in an abstract are based on unigrams, section headings, and sequential information from preceding sentences. These features resulted in improved performance over a simple bag-of-words approach, and outperform feature sets used in previous work.},

abstract = {As the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model is widely used for modeling and sharing a lot of online bioinformatics resources such as Uniprot (dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf) or Bio2RDF (bio2rdf.org), SPARQL -- a W3C recommendation query for RDF databases - has become an important query language for querying the bioinformatics knowledge bases. Moreover, due to the diversity of users' requests for extracting information from the RDF data as well as the lack of users' knowledge about the exact value of each fact in the RDF databases, it is desirable to use the SPARQL query with regular expression patterns for querying the RDF data. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that efficiently supports regular expression processing in SPARQL over RDF databases. Most of the existing techniques for processing regular expressions are designed for querying a text corpus, or only for supporting the matching over the paths in an RDF graph. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for supporting regular expression processing in SPARQL query. Our contributions can be summarized as follows. 1) We propose an efficient framework for processing SPARQL queries with regular expression patterns in RDF databases. 2) We propose a cost model in order to adapt the proposed framework in the existing query optimizers. 3) We build a prototype for the proposed framework in C++ and conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our technique. Experiments with a full-blown RDF engine show that our framework outperforms the existing ones by up to two orders of magnitude in processing SPARQL queries with regular expression patterns.},

abstract = {The side effect of drugs often results from a response to the unintended target of a drug. Recently there have been researches identifying targets of known drugs based on the side effect information. These researches, however, did not consider the association of drugs both with targets and with biological processes. The recent development of a database of the side effects, SIDER, is a first step to provide the relationship between drugs and side effects. In this paper, we propose a novel process-drug-side effect network that discovers the relationship between biological processes and side effects. The multi-level network (the process-drug-side effect network) is built by merging the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. Evaluation is conducted in two ways: 1) how many biological processes discovered by our method are found in co-occurred GO terms with biological processes extracted from the PubMed records by a text mining technique. 2) whether there is the performance improvement by limiting response processes by drugs sharing the same side effect only to frequent ones. The experimental results show that our process-drug-side effect network is able to discover meaningful relationships between biological processes and side effects in an efficient manner.},

On the basis of this finding, we combine the WSD approach with the CRF, and obtain significant improvements over the standalone CRF, gaining particularly in recall.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an unsupervised word sense disambiguation method for the biomedical domain. In this paper, a network representation of co-occurrence data is first defined to represent both word senses and word contexts. The representation expresses textual context observed around a certain term as a network, where nodes are terms and edges are the number of co-occurrences between connected terms. A graph kernel is adopted as a similarity measure between terms and senses represented in networks. Candidate senses and ambiguous contexts are then compared directly in the representation space to resolve the word sense. It only needs the sense definitions and a large amount of unlabeled texts. The experiments in the biomedical domain show that the method outperforms a baseline method of vector representation. The performance of the proposed method is comparable to the state-of-the-art unsupervised word sense disambiguation methods.},

Existing works in improving the search quality on PubMed have focused on helping PubMed query formulation, clustering the results, or ranking by relevance. This paper proposes a novel system that dynamically constructs a concept ontology based on the search results, which visualizes related concepts to the query in the form of ontology. The concept ontology can make the PubMed search more effective by detecting related concepts and their relation hidden in the documents. The ontology can broaden the user's knowledge by recommending new concepts unexpected by the user, and also serves to narrow down the search results by recommending additional query terms. The ontology construction is processed in real-time as a result of query, integrated within our PubMed search engine called RefMED. Our system is accesible at "http://dm.hwanjoyu.org/refmed".},
