abstract = {Genetic information can provide important insights into the detailed disease status of a patient, and guide the selection of the best choice of treatment for an individual. The Variome corpus, a small collection of published articles about inherited colorectal cancer, includes annotations of 11 entity types and 13 relation types capturing the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Due to the richness of these annotations, the corpus provides a good testbed for evaluation of biomedical literature information extraction systems. To date, the corpus has been employed to study the performance of mutation extraction systems but has to our knowledge not previously been tested for development of a relation extraction system.In this work, we explore the adaptation of the PKDE4J system to suit relation extraction of the fine-grained relations in the Variome corpus, and provide the first results for automatic relation extraction on the full set of relations captured in that corpus. PKDE4J extends the Stanford CoreNLP platform, consisting of an annotation pipeline including tokenization, lemmatization, dependency and constituency parsers, POS taggers, and other natural language processing components. For the machine learning tasks, we use a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model based on an implementation of L-BFGS.We focus on assessing performance of extraction of relations connecting entities in the corpus, using gold standard entities as a starting point (hence, limiting the task to a post-Named Entity Recognition process). We address extraction of 11 relations for which there are adequate annotations (attested at least 100 times) in the corpus, involving gene, disease, mutation, cohort/patient, body part entities and specific subtypes of characteristics. We test the PKDE4J system on this corpus, based on 10-fold cross-validation. Overall, the PKDE4J achieves a performance of 0.70-0.82 F-score on the relation extraction tasks.We find that the system adapted straightforwardly to the range of relation types represented in the corpus, and the results are competitive with state-of-the-art relation extraction performance on more heavily studied corpora. The system can provide a starting point for larger-scale extraction of information related to genetic variation in disease.},

abstract = {The impact of duplicate or inconsistent records in databases can be severe, and for general databases has led to development of a range of techniques for identification of such records. In bioinformatics, duplication arises when two or more database records represent the same biological entity, a problem that has been known for over 20 years. However, only a limited number of techniques for detecting bioinformatics duplicates have emerged. Special techniques for handling large data sets (a common 5000-record data set has over 10 million pairs to compare) and imbalanced data (where the prevalence of duplicate pairs is minute as compared to non-duplicate pairs). Biological domain interpretation (records with very similar sequences are not necessarily duplicates) is also important to adapt general methods to this context.In particular, machine learning techniques are widely used for finding duplicate records in general databases, but only a few have been proposed for bioinformatics. We have evaluated one such method against a collection of submitter-labeled duplicates in nucleotide databases. The results reveal that the best rule in the original study can only detect 0.2% of the duplicates, and overall results for all the rules are extremely poor. Our study highlights the need for techniques to solve this pressing problem.},

abstract = {We used a longitudinal biomarker, prostate specific antigen (PSA), to discover a new prognostic pattern that predicts castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy. PSA is an important biomarker of prostate cancer to monitor the response to the treatment, but existing PSA patterns such as pretreatment PSA level, nadir, time to nadir, and doubling time are computed based on only one or two PSA values before or around nadir, thus PSA has not been fully utilized as a whole sequence.We used 1645 PSA values after nadir from 261 men. We transformed the longitudinal PSA into PSA velocity and discrete sequences of PSA state. We then used frequent sequential pattern mining (PrefixSpan) to find frequent candidate patterns from the sequences. We computed AUC and C-index of the patterns by logistic regression and Cox regression, respectively to find the predictive candidate patterns. Among the candidate patterns, we chose the most informative patterns that were specific and rare because we assumed that the amount of information that a pattern has is large if i) the pattern is not sub-pattern of others, ii) the pattern's interval is shorter (concise) than others, or iii) the frequency of the pattern is less than other patterns. We compared the progression to CRPC of the final predictive and informative pattern with that of pretreatment PSA, nadir, and time to nadir, which are known as prognosis factor of CRPC. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to test survival difference between patients with and without the pattern.As a result, patients were less likely to be CRPC if, after PSA values reach nadir, the PSA decreases more than 0.048 ng/ml during a month, and the decrease occurs again. After investigating 19 HSPC and 5 CRPC candidate patterns of PSA after nadir, we found that the two declines pattern significantly increased the accuracy of predicting CRPC by supplementing information provided by existing PSA patterns such as pretreatment PSA. The AUC and C-index of this pattern was 0.82 and 0.77, respectively, which was comparably higher than that of other candidate patterns. The occurrence of two substantial declines after PSA nadir implies that PSA fluctuates after nadir. PSA might increase due to some reasons such as intermittent treatment, and decline as sensitively reacting to ADT.This result can help clinicians to stratify men by the risk of CRPC and to determine the patient that needs intensive follow-up.},

However, this entails a great deal of effort to clarify the interaction throughout in vitro or in vivo experiments. In this light, in silico prediction of the interactions between compounds and target proteins can help ease the efforts.In this study, data related to compounds, target proteins, and interactions between them are taken from DrugBank [1]. Then we characterized six classes of compound-target interaction networks in humans including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channel, enzymes, receptors, transporters, and other proteins. We then calculated the structural similarity matrix between compounds - as well as the protein sequence similarity matrix between target proteins - and established drug-target interaction. Also, classification-prediction models that predict the interactions between compounds and target proteins through a machine leaning method were constructed using these matrices. As a result, AUC values of six classes are 0.94, 0.93, 0.90, 0.89, 0.91, and 0.76 respectively. Finally, the interactions of compounds from natural products were predicted using the constructed classification models.},

abstract = {The survival of patients with breast cancer is highly sporadic, from a few months to more than 15 years. Recently, the large-scale gene expression profiling of tumors has been used as a promising means of predicting prognosis factors. In this study, we used large-scale gene expression datasets of tumors to identify prognostic factors in breast cancer. We conducted survival log-rank tests and used an unsupervised clustering method to find individual genes associated with worse survival rates. For each gene, log-rank test was performed between two groups of patients who had high and low gene expression levels. After the genes which were associated with poor survival were separated into high- or low-expressed gene sets, we clustered genes to find co-expressed or reciprocally expressed gene sets through maximal clique and bi-clique algorithms. As a result, four prognostic gene sets were constructed among 24,924 genes. Based on the ratio of high and low expression levels, our four scores predicted the worse survival rates in three independent data sets. In addition, we found that cancer patient with poor prognosis, i.e., triple-negative cancer types, HER2-enriched, and high-grade patients, had higher scores than those with other types of breast cancer. In conclusion, based on a gene expression analysis, we suggest that our well-defined method of the prediction of survival outcome may be useful for developing prognostic factors in breast cancer.},

abstract = {The scientific literature is a rich resource for information retrieval on the biological knowledge. Nevertheless, the unstructured textual data in the research articles makes it difficult to access the information with computer-aided systems. Text-mining is one of the solution that can transform unstructured information in the text into database content, and most of the approaches are based on the machine learning models. Since these approaches require high-dimensional features, the performance of the model is heavily dependent on the selection of features. However, it is usually difficult and labor-intensive to choose good features, because feature extraction requires prior knowledge and ingenuity of human experts. Here, we suggest a novel framework to extract biological relations from the texts by using hierarchical text features that enhance the effectiveness of relation extraction model.The proposed framework is composed of two parts, node and edge detection, using deep belief networks. Each part is based on the hierarchical text features learned by Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (GBRBM). In this work, we performed gene-cancer relation extraction task as a pilot study. The classification model was trained based on both GE09 corpus from BioNLP'09 Shared Task and CoMAGC corpus. The results show that our model achieved better performance than other handcrafted feature-based approaches. The evaluation results suggest that deep belief networks offers the optimized and generalized hierarchical text features for the large-scale text mining.},

abstract = {Construction of a virtual physiological human system by reconstructing biological networks is proposed as an alternative to traditional drug development process. In silico methods using biological networks in human have been used for resolving current issues of traditional drug discovery like high costs and low success rates. However, most of previous approaches for reconstructing biological networks have considered only one relation type although there are various types of relations not only in molecular level but also within over-molecule levels such as biological processes and diseases. In addition, each tissue specific network in previous works is isolated and it is not appropriate to analyze diseases associated to multi-tissues like type 2 diabetes (T2D).Here, we develop a framework for reconstructing genome-scale biological networks into a whole body level. We collected and integrated biological interactions in bio-synergy modeling language (BSML) format, which can contain anatomical context information and multi-components. Based on BSML format, we constructed context specific directed associations (CODA) repository comprising various types of interactions including not only molecular interactions such as tissue specific intracellular interactions and intercellular interactions but also associations between molecules and over-molecules. All of associations in CODA repository have anatomical contexts covering 71 tissue-cell types. To verify the possibility of uses of CODA to drug development, we selected T2D as a case study. We simulated effects of drugs on T2D with our CODA system, drug-drug target interaction information, and Petri Net.},

Even though various computational approaches are developed for predicting bioactive compounds, the prediction performances are diverse due to different methods and dataset. Therefore, there is urgent demand for an approach that connotes the previous methods and identify potential bioactive compounds with high accuracy. To meet the demand, we proposed a filtering strategy that identifies potential bioactive compounds by combining previously developed computational methods which predict ADMET, such as Human Intestinal Absorption (HIA) and Caco-2 permeability. Our approach was evaluated on 930 compounds that are known as bioactive compounds, which were extracted from literature, DrugBank and Dr. Dukes phytochemical databases. By applying our filtering strategy, 97.5% of the known bioactive compounds were correctly predicted as bioactive. We examined whether our approach can distinguish the potential bioactive compound from the non-potential bioactive compounds with Fishers' exact test, and a reasonable p-value (3.806 x 10-9) was derived. For the next step, we are planning to develop a machine-learning based method to improve our filtering approach.},

Here we evaluated three text-mining databases with genes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Their per-gene accuracy is high (57-100%), but their per-abstract accuracy is relatively low (33-64%). This represents that the association of gene and disease is well-identified when abundant articles are available. However, genes with fewer articles could be wrongfully identified associated. Consequently, human-curation is still complementary to current text-mining approaches and future text-mining methods should improve their accuracy for genes with few articles or information.},

abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of the major factors in drug development because it causes failure in clinical trials and withdrawals from market. Though, determining the DILI potentiality is still challenging due to its low occurrences and unexpected contradicts with clinical animal studies.There have been a variety of efforts and experiments on constructing prediction models to identify compounds that cause liver toxicity. However, the discriminant power of the previous models is not confident enough. Also, studies often relies on experimental data for better accuracy which can cause data access limitation and time consuming works. Therefore, some researchers started concerning compound properties and its molecular structures.In this study, we developed a classification model using liver toxicity related compounds as training set. We acquired 192 toxin data and 187 DILI-negative drugs. We obtained toxin data related to liver toxicity from two databases; Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) [1] , Toxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB) [2; 4]. For negative set, we used data from three previous studies which include DILI-labels.We used 18 compound properties and molecular structures as features of a classification model. We collected property information using the admetSAR website and the CDK descriptor tool. Moreover, we used the Pybel API provided by Open Babel [3] to retrieve fingerprints as structure information.In classification model construction, two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest, were used with physicochemical properties and structure information as features. The classifiers were developed through 10-fold cross-validation and resulted in accuracy of 73% and 80% in the SVM and the random forest model respectively.},

abstract = {Analyzing true effect of medicine or functional food is major issue in associated research area. In order to achieve that, gathering of massive clinical trial data is required. There are three major concepts for clinical trial data collection: Citizen Science, Health 2.0 and Crowdsourcing. Citizen Science, which uses web 2.0 technologies, is web-based service for health care. Health 2.0 uses non-professionally trained individuals to conduct science-related activities. Lastly, Crowdsourcing is an online distributed problem-solving and production model. Following systems have tried to process data based on above concepts. PatientsLikeme attempted to find potential benefits from clinical outcomes within longitudinal evaluation of online data-sharing platforms. ResearchKit is about to create apps that could revolutionize medical studies. However, these systems do not have reliable protocols to obtain credible results. In addition, they mainly focus on diseases with a medicine, not on effect with a functional food.Hereby, we are developing a novel system to solve the issues: Citizen Organization System for Advanced MEDical research(COSAMED). We are looking forward to find true effect information of a functional food with our new system. COSAMED is made of five steps to design a reliable protocol. (1) Target Item Selection, to select a target effect and effect related items. (2) Preparation of Research, to select designed clinical trial protocol on user demand with automated scientific criteria. (3) Recruiting Participants, to recruit participants from linked SNS friends or from other systems. (4) Data Collection, to collect effect information from various sources. (5) Analysis, to analyze the results by web-bases statistical tools, transfer results to a data warehouse and calculate credibility rate. Finally, the protocol is developed with product DB and clinical trial protocol snapshot DB on COSAMED. In future, we will integrate it with Openmhealth architecture to connect related systems easily and build it with user friendly interfaces to collect big data. COSAMED will be available at www.cosamed.org, and it will be a cornerstone of first citizen based clinical trial system.},

abstract = {Due to the importance of anti-cancer drug development, there has been a surge of publications pertinent to the field of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, a need for analysis of drug research trend is recognized to minimize risk of new drug testing and understand the anti-cancer drug research area. The purpose of this paper is to identify the landscape of pancreatic cancer drug research by analyzing the anti-cancer drugs extracted from PubMed records and clinical trials datasets. We conduct drug cluster analysis by using the topic modeling technique and network analysis of drug clusters. Comparison of two distinct datasets, scientific publications vs. clinical trials, gives us a new insight into identifying the different portrait of anti-cancer drug research in pure research and clinical settings.The results show that two distinct research trends are observed by ClinicalTrials dataset and PubMed records. It is the major difference with other bibliometric studies in cancer research. Using two different data sources, we can identify different drug research patterns. First, the assumption that drug research published in PubMed is preceded by clinical trials is statistically confirmed in our study. Second, a research trend of new drug testing with various targets is observed in clinical data. On the other hand, we identify that diverse chemicals (e.g. sodium, phosphatidylinositols, and calcium) together with standard therapeutic agent are studied in scientific publications in PubMed.},

abstract = {Herbs are natural products that human consume in many different ways such as food and medicine. They have a long empirical history to treat diseases and have relatively less side effects in comparison to Western medicine. Due to such strengths of herbs, many studies related to medicinal herbs have been conducted all over the world. For example, researches proving the medical efficacy of herbs in target diseases and developing new drugs for the treatment of various diseases have been performed. In this aspect, identifying chemicals in herbs is a crucial task because, although several existing databases related to traditional Chinese medicine currently provide herb-chemical relationships, the number of provided herbs is limited. Recently, with the accumulation of a large amount of biomedical articles on the Web site such as PubMed, it becomes possible to extract relationship from texts using a text-mining method. Thus, in this study, we constructed a herb-chemical corpus and developed a rule-based text mining model for identifying herb-chemical relationships from PubMed abstracts.},

abstract = {Due to an enormous number of scientific publications that cannot be handled manually, there is a rising interest in text-mining techniques for automated information extraction, especially in the biomedical field. Such techniques provide effective means of information search, knowledge discovery, and hypothesis generation. Therefore, we present PKDE4J, a comprehensive text-mining system that integrates dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a highly flexible and extensible framework. Extending Stanford CoreNLP, we developed the system with multiple types of entities and relations.We demonstrate the performance by evaluating on various corpora such as CRAFT, GENETAG, AnEM Corpus, NCBI Disease Corpus, DDI Corpus, Metabolite and Enzyme Corpus for NER and BioInfer, AIMed, GAD, CoMAGC, and PolySearch for RE and achieve with average F-measures of 85% for entity extraction and 82% for relation extraction. As advantages of this system, one is a configurability in various combinations of text-processing components that can be plugged in for different tasks. The other is an extensible framework for extraction; extensible rule engine for relation extraction (Plug-and-play approach).As shown in figure 1, the system contains two major pipelines for public knowledge discovery. The first pipeline extracts target entities based on dictionaries by extending the Stanford CoreNLP. The second pipeline applies dependency tree-based rules to sentences with two or more entities to extract relationships among those entities.},

abstract = {common and different research subjects and methods. Identifying popular and unpopular subjects and methods in both fields is critical to understand differences in two perspectives and to promote their collaboration. For Bioinformatics, discovering biologists' research interests that can be solved by bioinformatics is valuable. We explore subjects and methods dealt within Bioinformatics and Biology with an objective to understand the current state of the two research fields and to discover the potential hot spots for research. We introduce a subject-method network analysis and apply it to overview subjects, methods, and the associations between subjects and methods of the two fields.For our analysis, we applied the categories of Web of Science Journal Citation Report(SJCR) that the data were obtained from Biology and Mathematical and Computational Biology categories for each Biology and Bioinformatics. We analyzed edges that a pair of "Mathematical modeling of biological systems" and "Theoretical ecology" ranked the third among edges. Ecologists were interested in interactions of all the creatures but had limitation in exploring and observing the whole system. However, recently, Bioinformatics enabled ecologists to build a biological systems as a mathematical model to simulate the whole system regarding environmental factors. The edge ranked at 8th of Bioinformatics is "genetic history" and "circadian rhythm" pair. It means scholars were interested in how climate affects genetic history.We also analyzed communities that it showed difference in biology and bioinformatics. In the research of cancer, biology tries to understand the mechanism while bioinformatics searches the sequence to find the mutation that caused cancer. Both biology and bioinformatics semiparametric methods and meta-analysis, but biology applies statistical method and SVM to it while bioinformatics utilizes gene expression profiling, gene ontology, sequence alignment, protein prediction, computational methods in drug design, mass spectrometry frequently. It means biology looks cancer biology in molecular level but bioinformatics investigates it in gene level. It is similar to chronic disease.This study is to build a higher level of knowledge structure called subject-method network to enhance our understanding on research problems and solutions in two relevant fields, Biology and Bioinformatics.The extensions can be made by detecting subjects and methods with named entity recognition technique, by substituting degree centralities to other centralities, by adding meta-information such as author, affiliation, and journal, and by building an extensive network of subject-subject-method-method network.},

There have been a number of computational methods to analyze quantitative/qualitative traits of biomedical networks. However, a genome-wide observation of a molecular and system level response to a given perturbation is hardly explored due to the lack of proper large-scale inference models. Here we developed a novel expert system that can be applied to a conventional biological network by transforming node and edges into facts and rules. We tested our model to a newly constructed multi-level biomedical network to conduct an artificial triggering of oncogene and drug targets. We found up to 640 genes are affected from a single gene perturbation until the system recovers to the steady state.},

abstract = {It is necessary to predict the efficacy of individual drugs on patients to realize personalized medicine. Testing drugs on patients in clinical trial is the only way to evaluate the efficacy of drugs. The approach is labor intensive and requires overwhelming costs and a number of experiments. Therefore, preclinical model system has been intensively investigated for predicting the efficacy of drugs. Current computational drug sensitivity prediction [1-2] approaches used known genes, known pathways or general biological network module as their prediction features. Therefore, they missed indirect effector or the effects from tissue-specific interactions.In this study, we developed cell line specific functional modules, which are cell line specific features, as prediction features to predict the efficacy of drugs. Cell line specific functional modules are clusters of genes, which have similar biological functions in cell line specific networks. We used two types of data from the US National Cancer Institute 60 anticancer drug screen (NCI60)[3]: 1) cell line transcription data of nine tissue types and 52 different cell lines, 2)drug response data of 30 drugs across 52 of the cell lines. We used linear regression for drug sensitivity prediction. We assessed the prediction performance in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). We also selected functions which are associated with drug sensitivity.Our method performed better than random function module-based model. We also analyzed selected functions, which are associated with drug sensitivity, of five drugs - lapatinib, erotinib, raloxifen, tamoxifen and gefitinib- by our model. Two drug pairs in five drugs have same therapeutic effect. Our model also showed that two drug pairs have same selected functions.These results suggest that our model can provide drug sensitivity prediction and also provide functions which are associated with drug sensitivity. Therefore, we could utilize drug sensitivity associated functions for drug repositioning or for suggesting secondary drugs for overcoming drug resistance.},

abstract = {Motivation: Scaffold proteins are known as crucial regulators of various cellular functions by assembling multiple proteins involved in signaling and metabolic pathways. Identification of scaffold proteins and the study of their molecular mechanisms can open a new aspect of cellular systemic regulation and the resulting application on medicine and engineering. There have been highlighted the regulatory roles of dozens of scaffold proteins, but just one computational approach tried to find scaffold proteins from interactomes until now. However, there was a limitation to find diverse types of scaffold proteins because their criteria were restricted to the classical scaffold proteins.Methods: Here we suggest a systematic approach to predict massive scaffold proteins from interactomes and to characterize the roles of scaffold proteins comprehensively. We gathered known and predicted scaffold proteins from articles and interactomes. First, we carried out extraction of known scaffold proteins from review articles and collection of scaffold protein candidates from the UniProt and the PubMed using query search. Second, we proposed criteria for finding scaffold proteins and predicted scaffold proteins from interactome according to the criteria. Scaffold proteins are defined as proteins that: (i) directly interact with at least two proteins, (ii) have domain-domain interactions with two partner proteins using different domain regions, and (iii) are component of the same protein complex with two partner proteins. To characterize functional roles, we assigned the localization, pathway, and enzyme information of their partner proteins and classified functional roles of them from their partners' functionResults: From total 10,419 basic scaffold protein candidates in protein interactomes, we classified them into three classes according to structural evidences for scaffolding, such as domain architectures, domain interactions and protein complexes. Finally, we could define 2,716 highly reliable scaffold protein candidates and characterized functional features of these scaffold proteins. To assess the accuracy of our prediction, the gold standard positive and negative data sets are constructed. We prepared 158 gold standard positive data and 844 gold standard negative data based on functional information from Gene Ontology consortium. The precision, sensitivity and specificity of our testing was 83.8%, 42.4%, and 90.1%, respectively. Through function enrichment analysis about highly reliable scaffold proteins, we could confirm significantly enriched functions related on binding and found unexpected functions like transcription regulator activity, kinase activity, and ubiquitin protein ligase binding, etc. Furthermore, we identified functional association between scaffold proteins and their recruited proteins. From these results, we inferred novel functional information of scaffold proteins from recruited proteins. We also compared disease association of scaffold proteins with kinases and the result showed that the disease association of scaffold proteins is higher than kinases. As revealing more understandings about the roles of scaffold proteins in future studies, scaffolds will be used as generate novel and predictable pathway to program useful cellular behaviors. In conclusion, our finding can support further investigation to understand scaffold proteins and discover targets for molecular engineering and therapy.},
