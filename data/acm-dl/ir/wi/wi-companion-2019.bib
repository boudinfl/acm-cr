abstract = {Consider the problem of socially isolated people who are not trusted by the people around them. This can be not only in the real world, but also in human relations on SNS. Using a new theory of opinion dynamics that can handle both trust and distrust among people, we perform simulations related to isolated person. We found that a charismatic popular person could be saved by having a relationship with an isolated person. However, on the other hand, the charismatic population is weakened.},

abstract = {Using a large amount of social media data, this study employed a variety of computational methods to investigate online extremism in Japan. In order to explain the increase of online extremism, this study identifies extremists by estimating the ideological position of social media users based on the follower-followee relationship. Following this, this study characterizes the behavioral patterns of such individuals from two perspectives: comparison of profile information and preference in online discussions among different ideological groups.Computational methods provide many insights into the online extremism in Japan. First, this study finds that although online extremism has been frequently debated about in the recent years, it is somewhat surprising there were a relatively limited number of extremists. Moreover, this study finds that such individuals are more likely to spread information and express their views than moderate users. They particularly exhibit a significant preference to engage in discussions related to political issues or social issues. As a consequence, their behavior and views are more likely to capture a lot of attention and generate influence as a consequence. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that online extremism in Japan is attributed to the behavioral patterns of extremists, rather than their increasing number.},

abstract = {The spread of digital communication technology has enabled office workers to perform many tasks at remote locations such as at home, in cafes, and in shared offices. However, remote workers are likely to feel anxious about the decline in their trust with colleagues and the loss of opportunities to obtain important information. Employee well-being is an important management issue as it relates to the productivity and growth potential of an organization. The purpose of this study is to identify the features of communication in the workplace that are important for maintaining the well-being of employees. We aim to determine behaviors that employees should prioritize in their respective situations of remote work and office work. As a research approach, real-time face-to-face communication data detected by a wearable sensor is used. The data was classified as communication characteristics of total time, variety, frequency, and interactivity. We analyzed this face-to-face, real-time communication data in relation to Psychological Capital (PsyCap), a positive multi-dimensional construct derived by Fred Luthans consisting of hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism or the HERO within. There is a growing body of published research which has clearly demonstrated PsyCap is related to and causes employee improved performance and well-being. A experiment found that employees with high PsyCap tend to talk with diverse persons for a relatively short period of time in the workplace and also have a relatively long time of interactive dialogue. It turned out that these elements of face-to-face communication are related to the credibility to oneself and their team. In particular, taking a PsyCap perspective and approach when communicating (i.e., internally and exhibiting externally) with colleagues and team-mates should promote not only improved communication but also well-being.},

abstract = {Previous work on link prediction focuses on single network settings or transferring knowledge between two networks for predicting intra-network links. However, many real-world applications involve multiple networks, and we need to predict cross-network links in these networks instead. For example, when mergers or acquisitions happen between two companies, the two business networks need to be merged into one. We may want to promote cross-network links, such as connections between the users in PayPal with those in x.com, to speed up the merger and integration of the two business networks. Considering recommending cross-network links can significantly speed up the business integration, in this paper, we study the problem of cross-network link prediction in merged heterogeneous networks. The goal is to predict potential links between multiple kinds of nodes across the two merged networks. It is also highly challenging because little or no information is previously known about the cross-network links, i.e., a cold-start problem. We proposed an approach, called NetMerger, which first learns network embeddings of the merged networks based upon their network structures and then makes cross-network link predictions. We compared our method with baselines on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposal. },

abstract = {A variety of information is transmitted through websites, which often requires users to give immediate and appropriate reactions. Consequently, users must make ever greater efforts to select information themselves, and this is fueling further improvements in recommendation services that can reduce such burdens. On the other hand, filter bubbles that only provide biased information to users are generated due to redundant recommendations. Previous research has analyzed the behavioral changes of users on existing news sites, and findings have suggested that the index of diversity of browsed articles decreases over time. However, no consideration has been given to the change in the category diversity of articles across news media and the influence of the number of views. In this research, we propose a method to evaluate the relationship between the change in diversity and the period and number of views by dividing the target period at regular intervals and evaluating the diversity of article categories by considering the readability of each article based on the number of views. Then, we analyze the relationship between the change in diversity of the entire media and the change in the variety of articles viewed by users on the actual online media, as well as the influence of the period and number of views on the change in diversity. As a result, there is a correlation between changes in user behavior and changes in the number of browsing times. Furthermore, the results indicate that the change in the category diversity of articles across news media has a strong impact on the change in the diversity of users.},

abstract = {TV news is the major source of political information for most of the people, exercising a strong influence on public opinion. Japanese news media try to carefully balance politicians’ representation, but it is important to empirically examine this balance longitudinally. However, it is a tedious, and in many cases impossible task to achieve manually, especially when the news archive covers over a decade. We therefore rely on automatic procedures to do it computationally rather than manually. In this paper, we compare the two face tracking methods as well as a traditional text-based method by using the same dataset of Japanese broadcasting news spanning over a decade. We evaluate the three methods against a manually curated random sample of NHK’s News 7, the flagship news program of the Japanese public broadcasting. The first tracking method is inherited from previous works used on the same dataset and based on traditional Viola-Jones detections and VGGFace for embeddings. Our second method uses modern deep learning techniques with MTCNN for face detection, and ResNet50 trained with VGGFace2 for embeddings. We not only demonstrate that our modern implementation outperforms the two other methods, but also discuss implications and application for social scientific studies.},

It is known that the home locations of certain users, such as celebrities, are hard to estimate using relationships. However, because estimating the home locations of all celebrities is not actually hard, it is important to clarify the characteristics of users whose home locations are hard to estimate. We analyze whether centralities, which represent users’ characteristics, and the tendency to have the same home locations as friends are related. The results indicate that PageRank and HITS scores are related to whether users have the same home location as friends, and that users with higher HITS scores have the same home location as their friends less often. This result indicates that there are two types of users whose home locations are difficult to estimate: hub users who follow many celebrities and authority users who are celebrities.},

Actually, emotions affect our choices and are activated as feedback during the decision process. In Recommender Systems research, preference learning is an important element to produce good recommendations. Preferences can be acquired by explicitly asking the user or by analyzing his implicit feedback that can be inferred from his behavior. Following the latter vein of research, we developed a novel approach to automatically extract these preferences by analyzing the gaze behavior and the facial expressions of the users while looking at item’s images form making a choice between them. Specifically, we focused on pairwise image comparisons in a preference elicitation experiment and exploited a Process Mining approach to learn preferences. In particular, we investigated whether behavior patterns can be learned and used to predict the user choice. We evaluated strategies based on gaze behavior and experienced emotions and results obtained so far show promising prediction performance.},

We focus on the use case of gaming based platforms like Twitch.tv, where the content is classified by semi-free categories by the users. We also apply our methodology to the MovieLens dataset to try to predict the ratings of the users and provide a degree of comparability. We evaluate our results using a modified accuracy metric and also the normalized discounted cumulative gain when comparing with user ratings. We show that this heuristic more closely maps to the natural search behavior of users in content platforms than the classic neighborhood methods, and show how it can be used to improve recommendation, ad targeting, and content production.},

abstract = {In the field of image forensics, many convolutional neural network (CNN)-based forensic methods have been proposed and generally achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, some questions are worth studying and answering regarding the trustworthiness of such methods, including for example the appropriateness of the discriminative information automatically extracted by CNN and the generalization performance on “unseen” data during the testing phase. In this paper, we study these questions in the case of a specific forensic problem of distinguishing between natural images (NIs) and colorized images (CIs). Through a series of experiments, we analyze the impact of data preparation and setting of the first layer of a recent state-of-the-art CNN-based method on the detector’s forensic performance, in particular the generalization capability. We obtain some interesting observations which can serve as useful hints for carrying out image forensics experiments. Moreover, we propose a very simple method to improve the generalization performance of colorized image detection by combining decision results from CNN models with different settings at the network’s first layer.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a main-stream technique to alleviate information overload. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has become very popular in the field of collaborative filtering. For computation of collaborative filtering, traditional SVD algorithms are too slow, randomized SVD algorithms using sampling techniques are more practical than them. The approximation accuracy of these randomized SVD algorithms, however, comes with a high price at their sampling. The enlargement of sample-set picked by the sampling will dramatically increase the computational complexity. The algorithm proposed in this paper aims to give a more efficient precision-improvement to these randomized SVD algorithms under some assumptions of collaborative filtering. The idea of our algorithm is two-fold. Firstly, the a priori error estimate of these randomized SVD algorithms is replaced by an efficient a posteriori estimate to control the amount of further sampling adaptively. Secondly, since SVD is actually a factorization to diagonalize a matrix with orthogonal transforms, our algorithm iteratively improve the precision with two basic operations: a diagonal-attraction operation to transform the matrix according to further sampling for better concentration of residuals near the diagonal, and a diagonal-absorption operation to absorb a large portion of these concentrated residuals into the diagonal. Experiments have shown that our algorithm can efficiently improve the precision of a randomized SVD in collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {Cyberspace topologies can be demonstrated mathematically by a graph theoretic approach which basic structure is in accord with the interconnected world of social networks. Subgraph pattern matching analysis is an approach to performing computer network data analysis that executes efficient continuous queries on dynamic social graphs and minimizes the overhead on both search space and query. Privacy preserving has become a forward-looking interest both in industry and in academia in recent years, especially for social media streams and cyber data sources are prominent examples of high throughput and dynamic graphs, which made us inundate with the stream of updates. Existing research work about anonymizing a social network is still an open question for research. It is because altering attributes of vertices and edges might affect the neighbourhood relationships between vertices; removing or adding vertices and edges might also influence other vertices and edges as well as the properties of the social network. As a matter of fact, measuring information loss in the re-construction of graph is also a problem of research. Therefore, the technical challenges of privacy security have aroused a lot of attention, including rational dataset anonymity strategy, subgraph matching method, user queries processing without compromising sensitive information and and adversary background capability modelling. As today's defenses on the network are fast becoming obsolete and dealing with problems causing by flooding activities and untrustworthy nodes in the network is urgent. To this end, this talk will complement the corresponding defects of existing methods as well as enhance overall security posture. More specifically, this research will investigate: (i) how to perform privacy preserving graph analytics on encrypted graphs, and (ii) how to ensure that the procedure of matching can be protected from privacy breach. In addition, we also focus on incremental processing algorithm that can support high data velocity social data graph with distributed environment. It is hoped that by doing so, it can alleviate the burden of searching (sub-)graph patterns. Finally, quantification analysis on information loss under different data and anonymous structural methods will be studied to find out the most suitable ones for privacy protection. The objective is to build a complete and strong framework aiming at dealing with not only scalability, confidentiality privacy leakage, and authenticity, but also fairness towards aborting behaviors, which can improve the work of privacy-preserving technique to achieve efficiency, safety, and convenience in practical application.To preserve nodes’ privacy, all identities are removed as shown in Figure 1(b). Unfortunately, if an adversary has acquired some knowledge about the neighbors of an individual, the privacy leakage may still happen. If an attacker knows that Dave has two close friends who they are mutual friends and has another three friends who do not know each other, the 1-neighborhood graph of Dave as shown in Figure l (d), so the node representing Dave can be correctly identified since no other vertices don't share the same 1-neighborhood graph in the released network. To protect the privacy network, the traditional method is to guarantee that any individual cannot be located uniquely in the anonymized social network with a probability higher than 1/k, where k is a user- specified parameter carrying the same structural pattern in the k-anonymity model. By adding a noise edge connecting Fred with Greg, the 1-neighborhood graph of every vertex in Figure (e) is not unique, which can ensure an adversary with the 1- neighborhood knowledge cannot target any individual from this anonymous graph with a confidence higher than 1.However, the existing work about anonymizing a social network is limited since altering labels of vertices and edges may affect the neighborhood relationships between vertices, and removing or adding vertices and edges may influence other vertices and edges as well as the properties of the Social network.},

abstract = {With the development of big data, the amount of text data is growing bigger and bigger in which errors are also more and more. The traditional human-correction cannot meet the actual demand. It is a trend for automatic text proofing by using computer data processing. Chinese text errors can be divided into two categories: non-word error and real-word error. One or more character in a Chinese word replaced by other character will result in the word does not belong to the Chinese dictionary, which we call "non-word error". The word segmentation is firstly performed on the corpus in Chinese NLP, and non-word error will be divided into several disperse strings, which bring Chinese text proofreading several problems, because there are single-character words and multi-characters words in Chinese dictionary. In this paper, an approach is proposed to construct Chinese typo-pairs from Web corpus, which can be used in Chinese text automatic proofreading efficiently. Firstly, the method adds similar words into a candidate set using fuzzy matching algorithm, and then validates the similar words in the candidate set using statistical models, and finally constructs the typo-pairs.},

To tackle this problem, we propose a framework to detect such groups through a community detection approach.

abstract = {The Web and social media nowadays play an increasingly significant role in spreading terrorism-related propaganda and content. In order to deploy counterterrorism measures, authorities rely on automated systems for analysing text, multimedia, and social media content on the Web. However, since each of these systems is an isolated solution, investigators often face the challenge of having to cope with a diverse array of heterogeneous sources and formats that generate vast volumes of data. Semantic Web technologies can alleviate this problem by delivering a toolset of mechanisms for knowledge representation, information fusion, semantic search, and sophisticated analyses of terrorist networks and spatiotemporal information. In the Semantic Web environment, ontologies play a key role by offering a shared, uniform model for semantically integrating information from multimodal heterogeneous sources. An additional benefit is that ontologies can be augmented with powerful tools for semantic enrichment and reasoning. This paper presents such a unified semantic infrastructure for information fusion of terrorism-related content and threat detection on the Web. The framework is deployed within the TENSOR EU-funded project, and consists of an ontology and an adaptable semantic reasoning mechanism. We strongly believe that, in the short- and long-term, these techniques can greatly assist Law Enforcement Agencies in their investigational operations.},

abstract = {Computer vision systems are increasingly used for the early detection of skin cancers. Recognizing the first sign of melanoma is very important because if melanoma is found and treated in its primary stage the chances for long-term survival are excellent. On the contrary, as it progresses its treatment becomes increasingly harder and it has worse outcome. The various proposals of computer vision systems are characterized by some fundamental common phases: image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, features extraction and finally classification. Feature extraction aims at extracting the features from the lesion image in order to characterize the melanoma and feed the classifier. The recent research provided many different feature extraction algorithms for melanoma diagnosis from dermoscopy images from the simplest to the most sophisticated. Features are typically extracted using digital image processing methods (i.e., segmentation, edge detection and color and structure processing), and an open discussion about the meaning of these features and the objective ways of measuring them is ongoing. This paper is a contribution to the feature extraction phase as it describes the most frequently used features in the elaboration of computer vision systems and reports a description of recent works for feature extraction and classification. },

The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and clinical decision making. Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications, including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the electronic health medical data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches are employed to implement a set of services to recommend a list of diseases and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients’ health issues more efficiently.},

abstract = {Nowadays, increasing Internet use is plagued by malicious activity. Drive-by downloads are still a serious problem. Furthermore, new kinds of malicious sites are increasing. Published analysis has reported that 10% of Internet are malicious. To countermeasure these malicious URLs, blacklisting based on threat intelligence is widely used as a multilayer defense mechanism in modern Internet security techniques. Blacklisting on the network side is especially effective for protecting critical information infrastructure of various industries because it is not necessary to change the configuration or to use system resources. We propose a method of collecting efficiently malicious candidate URLs (seed) from open information and generating highly accurate blacklists based on information. This open information is called “Open Source Intelligence” (OSINT). OSINT information must be examined carefully to detect inaccuracies. Our seed collector that collects 50% or more truly malicious URLs, and we showed 75% of the blacklist generated by our proposed method was unknown to Google Safe Browsing. We also showed that malware collected by our method was rich in family variations, and 23% of the malware was unknown.},

abstract = {Today, an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare devices, crucial to a person's wellbeing and life, connects to the internet and consequently is exposed to a variety of threats. These devices possess low computational resources, and as a result they cannot use security tools such as antivirus or firewalls. Consequently, they become easy targets for cyber-attacks and malware infection, thus putting a person's life at risk. One way to protect these devices from malware infection is Remote Attestation (RA), a process by which a device with low computational power (prover) verifies its internal state to a party with higher computational resources (verifier) upon the latter's request. However, in case the verifier is malicious, it may constantly send numerous requests for RA to a prover to prevent it from performing the functions it was designed for. Thus, keeping it busy and rendering it unusable to its legit users as well as services. In short, the verifier performs a Computational Denial of Service (CDoS) attack against the prover. This paper proposes the BARRETT architecture which uses a Public Ethereum Network (PEN) in conjunction with an RA protocol to protect the prover from CDoS attacks. In particular, the PEN in BARRETT deters CDoS by forcing the verifier to pay a fee in Ether cryptocurrency every time they wish to send an Attestation Request (AR) to a prover. The verifier pays the fee since in BARRETT it can send the AR only via Ethereum transactions. Consequently, any attempt to perform a CDoS becomes prohibitively expensive.},

abstract = {Urbanization is accelerating at a high pace. This places new and critical issues on the transition towards smarter, efficient, livable as well as economically, socially and environmentally sustainable cities. Urban Mobility is one of the toughest challenges. In many cities, existing mobility systems are already inadequate, yet urbanization and increasing populations will increase mobility demand still further. Understanding traffic flows within an urban environment, studying similarities (or dissimilarity) among weekdays, finding the peaks within a day are the first steps towards understanding urban mobility. Following the implementation of a micro-simulation model in the city of Modena based on actual data from traffic sensors, a huge amount of information that describes daily traffic flows within the city were available. This paper reports an in-depth investigation of traffic flows in order to discover trends. Traffic analyzes to compare working days, weekends and to identify significant deviations are performed. Moreover, traffic flows estimations were studied during special days such as weather alert days or holidays to discover particular tendencies. This preliminary study allowed to identify the main critical points in the mobility of the city. },

abstract = {Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a new approach for multimodal transportation in smart cities which refers to the seamless integration of various forms of transport services accessible through one single digital platform. In a MaaS environment there can be a multitude of multi modal options to reach a destination which are derived from combinations of available transport services. Therefore, route planning functionalities in the MaaS era need to be able to generate multi-modal routes using constraints related to a user's modal allowances, service provision and limited user preferences (e.g. mode exclusions) and suggest to the traveller the routes that are relevant for specific trips as well as aligned to her/his preferences. In this paper, we describe an architecture for a MaaS multi-modal route planner which integrates i) a dynamic journey planner that aggregates unimodal routes from existing route planners (e.g. Google directions or Here routing), enriches them with innovative mobility services typically found in MaaS schemes, and converts them to multimodal options, while considering aspects of transport network supply and ii) a route recommender that filters and ranks the available routes in an optimal manner, while trying to satisfy travellers’ preferences as well as requirements set by the MaaS operator (e.g. environmental friendliness of the routes or promotion of specific modes of transport).},

abstract = {The mobility landscape has changed over the last years with the advent of innovative transportation solutions which are being constantly deployed whereas more are set to emerge in the near future such as autonomous vehicles and flying taxis. In this landscape a new mobility paradigm has come to the forefront during the last years through Mobility as a Service (MaaS). This refers to a seamless integration of various forms of transport services accessible through one single digital platform. The concept of MaaS is aligned with Smart mobility, one of main Smart City components which refers to smart manners of people and goods mobility through the integration of all transport modes, ICT solutions, zero pollution and congestions and so on [1]. A key enabler for MaaS is technology that can provide the means for complex mobility ecosystems to be integrated, while allowing diverse service providers and related stakeholders (e.g. payment management organizations) to perform transactions between each other (for booking, invoicing, payment, etc.) as well as interact with the traveler, acquire and exchange operational data, and process it into information that can be used to support MaaS related business processes. Such an ecosystem can be centrally coordinated when all participants in the value chain have the same understanding of what needs to be delivered and accept to follow a common approach, which can be proprietary, customized and aligned to vendor specific guidelines. As the MaaS ecosystem expands and the coordination of an increasing number of mobility solutions comes into play, the complexity can be such that new decentralized solutions are required. In this work in progress paper we discuss the role of blockchain technology for enabling seamless mobility for MaaS.},

abstract = {With continuous evolution of web standard, dynamic web application needs are driving precipitous browser technology advancements. To fulfill the requirements of dynamic web applications, modern browsers transformed into complex system platforms similar to operating systems. However, evercomplex os-like browser architecture has led to inefficient hardware resource consumption and the increasing hardware resource requirements, such as memory requirements and CPU requirements, of the web browsers raise a challenging problem for resource-constrained embedded devices or consumer electronics devices. Considering both limited hardware capabilities of the consumer electronics devices and increasing hardware resource demands of the web browsers, the resource consumption of the web browser must be mitigated. In this demo, we introduce a novel edge distributed web browser solution. The browser is designed for both memory resource requirements mitigation and JavaScript execution speed enhancement to overcome the resource constraints of the low-end devices. We demonstrate that the distributed web browser (DWB) reduces up to 41% of the memory consumption compared to the Chrome browser. We also demonstrate that the DWB speeds up the complicated JavaScript application execution performance in low-end devices. In the demo, the OS-like browser process runs on the user target device and the application-like renderer process runs on the remote edge device. },

Over 300 hours worth of videos are uploaded every minute and 5 billion videos are watched every day - almost one video per person worldwide. Because videos can deliver a complex message in a way that captures the audience’s attention more effectively than text-based platforms, it has become one of the most relevant platforms in the age of digital mass communication. This makes the analysis of YouTube content and user behavior invaluable not only to information scientists but also communication researchers, journalists, sociologists, and many more. There exists a number of YouTube analysis tools but few of them provide an in-depth qualitative and quantitative insights into user behavior or networks from massive aggregated data. Towards that direction, we introduce YouTubeTracker - a tool designed to gather YouTube data and gain insights on content and users. This tool can help identify leading actors, networks and spheres of influence, emerging popular trends, as well as user opinion. This analysis can also be used to understand user engagement and social networks. This can help reveal suspicious and inorganic behaviors (e.g., trolling, botting) causing algorithmic manipulations. Utility of the YouTubeTracker application is demonstrated via a case study on NATO’s 2018 Trident Juncture Exercise.},

In order to deal with this issue, necessary anonymisation measures need to be taken which, however, reduce the quality of a dataset by modifying its values. Data publishers may deem that some QIs are more important than others and, therefore, should be distorted as little as possible in the anonymisation process. Most existing tools do not take such weighting into consideration. In this demo, we present a tool addressing this issue by utilising a local recoding algorithm for k-anonymity, capable of outperforming the existing state-of-the-art tool ARX.},

Different from collaborative filtering based recommendation, which relies on usage patterns from a large number of users, we propose a novel approach that does not require other users’ information. We formulate the recommendation as a task of knowledge base completion and exploit the expert knowledge from a music knowledge base. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated, and the player is released as an open-source software for music lovers.},

abstract = {Empirical and Traditional knowledge is part of the concept of intangible cultural heritage, which represents immaterial cultural heritage items such as facts, stories, and traditions that are part of local culture. However, this knowledge might be lost over time. Encouraging public participation to record empirical knowledge is a way to preserve the culture of a region and make it known to others. This paper presents a web system that aims to record and to preserve empirical knowledge data. To achieve this goal, the tool uses three combined approaches: (i) crowdsourcing calls oriented to content creation by visitors; (ii) collaborative curation among experts for selection, evaluation, and publication of content; and (iii) interconnection between user contributions and data already available in open repositories on the web (in LOD format). The tool was applied in the Botany domain to curate empirical and cultural data about medicinal plants, where experts from the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden evaluated it.},
