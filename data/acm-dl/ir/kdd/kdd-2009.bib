abstract = {Data mining techniques use 'score functions' to quantify how well a model fits a given data set. Parameters are estimated by optimising the fit, as measured by the chosen score function, and model choice is guided by the size of the scores for the different models. Since different score functions summarise the fit in different ways, it is important to choose a function which matches the objectives of the data mining exercise. For predictive classification problems, a wide variety of score functions exist, including measures such as precision and recall, the F measure, misclassification rate, the area under the ROC curve (the AUC), and others. The first four of these require a 'classification threshold' to be chosen, a choice which may not be easy, or may even be impossible, especially when the classification rule is to be applied in the future. In contrast, the AUC does not require the specification of a classification threshold, but summarises performance over the range of possible threshold choices. However, unfortunately, and despite the widespread use of the AUC, it has a previously unrecognised fundamental incoherence lying at the core of its definition. This means that using the AUC can lead to poor model choice and unecessary misclassifications. The AUC is set in context, its deficiency explained and the implications illustrated - with the bottom line being that the AUC should not be used. A family of coherent alternative scores is described. The ideas are illustrated with examples from bank loans, fraud, face recognition, and health screening.},

Our approach is based on a model that predicts response as a multiplicative function of row and column latent factors that are estimated through separate regressions on known row and column features. In fact, our model provides a single unified framework to address both cold and warm start scenarios that are commonplace in practical applications like recommender systems, online advertising, web search, etc. We provide scalable and accurate model fitting methods based on Iterated Conditional Mode and Monte Carlo EM algorithms. We show our model induces a stochastic process on the dyadic space with kernel (covariance) given by a polynomial function of features. Methods that generalize our procedure to estimate factors in an online fashion for dynamic applications are also considered. Our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a novel content recommendation application that arises in the context of Yahoo! Front Page. We report significant improvements over several commonly used methods on all datasets.},

One of our insightful observations is that the experimental behavior of different classes of algorithms is very different in the uncertain case as compared to the deterministic case. In particular, the hyper-structure and the candidate generate-and-test algorithms perform much better than tree-based algorithms. This counter-intuitive behavior is an important observation from the perspective of algorithm design of the uncertain variation of the problem. We will test the approach on a number of real and synthetic data sets, and show the effectiveness of two of our approaches over competitive techniques.},

abstract = {A major source of information (often the most crucial and informative part) in scholarly articles from scientific journals, proceedings and books are the figures that directly provide images and other graphical illustrations of key experimental results and other scientific contents. In biological articles, a typical figure often comprises multiple panels, accompanied by either scoped or global captioned text. Moreover, the text in the caption contains important semantic entities such as protein names, gene ontology, tissues labels, etc., relevant to the images in the figure. Due to the avalanche of biological literature in recent years, and increasing popularity of various bio-imaging techniques, automatic retrieval and summarization of biological information from literature figures has emerged as a major unsolved challenge in computational knowledge extraction and management in the life science. We present a new structured probabilistic topic model built on a realistic figure generation scheme to model the structurally annotated biological figures, and we derive an efficient inference algorithm based on collapsed Gibbs sampling for information retrieval and visualization. The resulting program constitutes one of the key IR engines in our SLIF system that has recently entered the final round (4 out 70 competing systems) of the Elsevier Grand Challenge on Knowledge Enhancement in the Life Science. Here we present various evaluations on a number of data mining tasks to illustrate our method.},

We have applied this classifier to over 20 million names from a large-scale news corpus, identifying interesting temporal and spatial trends on the representation of particular cultural/ethnic groups.},

abstract = {The central challenge in temporal data analysis is to obtain knowledge about its underlying dynamics. In this paper, we address the observation of noisy, stochastic processes and attempt to detect temporal segments that are related to inconsistencies and irregularities in its dynamics. Many conventional anomaly detection approaches detect anomalies based on the distance between patterns, and often provide only limited intuition about the generative process of the anomalies. Meanwhile, model-based approaches have difficulty in identifying a small, clustered set of anomalies.We propose Information-theoretic Meta-clustering (ITMC), a formalization of model-based clustering principled by the theory of lossy data compression. ITMC identifies a 'unique' cluster whose distribution diverges significantly from the entire dataset. Furthermore, ITMC employs a regularization term derived from the preference for high compression rate, which is critical to the precision of detection.For empirical evaluation, we apply ITMC to two temporal anomaly detection tasks. Datasets are taken from generative processes involving heterogeneous and inconsistent dynamics. A comparison to baseline methods shows that the proposed algorithm detects segments from irregular states with significantly high precision and recall.},

abstract = {The availability and the accuracy of the data dictate the success of a data mining application. Increasingly, there is a need to resort to on-line data collection to address the problem of data availability. However, participants in on-line data collection applications are naturally distrustful of the data collector as well as their peer respondents, resulting in inaccurate data collected as the respondents refuse to provide truthful data in fear of collusion attacks. The current anonymity-preserving solutions for on-line data collection are unable to adequately resist such attacks in a scalable fashion. In this paper, we present an efficient anonymous data collection protocol for a malicious environment such as the Internet. The protocol employs cryptographic and random shuffling techniques to preserve participants' anonymity. The proposed method is collusion-resistant and guarantees that an attacker will be unable to breach an honest participant's anonymity unless she controls all N-1 participants. In addition, our method is efficient and achieved 15-42% communication overhead reduction in comparison to the prior state-of-the-art methods.},

Such applications can typically be represented as evolving interaction graphs with nodes denoting entities and edges representing their interactions. The study of entities and communities and how they evolve in such large dynamic graphs is both important and challenging.While much of the past work in this area has focused on static analysis, more recently researchers have investigated dynamic analysis. In this paper, in a departure from recent efforts, we consider the problem of analyzing patterns and critical events that affect the dynamic graph from the viewpoint of a single node, or a selected subset of nodes. Defining and extracting a relevant viewpoint neighborhood efficiently, while also quantifying the key relationships among nodes involved are the key challenges we address. We also examine the evolution of viewpoint neighborhoods for different entities over time to identify key structural and behavioral transformations that occur.},

In this paper we present an algorithm to balance the need to keep a website fresh with new content with the desire to present the best content to the most visitors at times of peak traffic. We formulate this as the media scheduling problem, where we attempt to maximize total clicks, given the overall traffic pattern and the time varying clickthrough rates of available media content. We present an efficient algorithm to perform this scheduling under certain conditions and apply this algorithm to real data obtained from server logs, showing evidence of significant improvements in traffic from our algorithmic schedules. Finally, we analyze the click data, presenting models for why and how the clickthrough rate for new content declines as it ages.},

abstract = {As clustering methods are often sensitive to parameter tuning, obtaining stability in clustering results is an important task. In this work, we aim at improving clustering stability by attempting to diminish the influence of algorithmic inconsistencies and enhance the signal that comes from the data. We propose a mechanism that takes m clusterings as input and outputs m clusterings of comparable quality, which are in higher agreement with each other. We call our method the Clustering Agreement Process (CAP). To preserve the clustering quality, CAP uses the same optimization procedure as used in clustering. In particular, we study the stability problem of randomized clustering methods (which usually produce different results at each run). We focus on methods that are based on inference in a combinatorial Markov Random Field (or Comraf, for short) of a simple topology. We instantiate CAP as inference within a more complex, bipartite Comraf. We test the resulting system on four datasets, three of which are medium-sized text collections, while the fourth is a large-scale user/movie dataset. First, in all the four cases, our system significantly improves the clustering stability measured in terms of the macro-averaged Jaccard index. Second, in all the four cases our system managed to significantly improve clustering quality as well, achieving the state-of-the-art results. Third, our system significantly improves stability of consensus clustering built on top of the randomized clustering solutions.},

abstract = {In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in the analysis of process logs. Several proposed techniques, such as workflow mining, are aimed at automatically deriving the underlying workflow models. However, current approaches only pay little attention on an important piece of information contained in process logs: the timestamps, which are used to define a sequential ordering of the performed tasks. In this work we try to overcome these limitations by explicitly including time in the extracted knowledge, thus making the temporal information a first-class citizen of the analysis process. This makes it possible to discern between apparently identical process executions that are performed with different transition times between consecutive tasks.This paper proposes a framework for the user-interactive exploration of a condensed representation of groups of executions of a given process. The framework is based on the use of an existing mining paradigm: Temporally-Annotated Sequences (TAS). These are aimed at extracting sequential patterns where each transition between two events is annotated with a typical transition time that emerges from input data. With the extracted TAS, which represent sets of possible frequent executions with their typical transition times, a few factorizing operators are built. These operators condense such executions according to possible parallel or possible mutual exclusive executions. Lastly, such condensed representation is rendered to the user via the exploration graph, namely the Temporally-Annotated Graph (TAG).The user, the domain expert, is allowed to explore the different and alternative factorizations corresponding to different interpretations of the actual executions. According to the user choices, the system discards or retains certain hypotheses on actual executions and shows the consequent scenarios resulting from the coresponding re-aggregation of the actual data.},

The consideration of existential uncertainty of item(sets), indicating the probability that an item(set) occurs in a transaction, makes traditional techniques inapplicable. In this paper, we introduce new probabilistic formulations of frequent itemsets based on possible world semantics. In this probabilistic context, an itemset X is called frequent if the probability that X occurs in at least minSup transactions is above a given threshold τ. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach addressing this problem under possible worlds semantics. In consideration of the probabilistic formulations, we present a framework which is able to solve the Probabilistic Frequent Itemset Mining (PFIM) problem efficiently. An extensive experimental evaluation investigates the impact of our proposed techniques and shows that our approach is orders of magnitude faster than straight-forward approaches.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm, called the Offset Tree, for learning to make decisions in situations where the payoff of only one choice is observed, rather than all choices. The algorithm reduces this setting to binary classification, allowing one to reuse any existing, fully supervised binary classification algorithm in this partial information setting. We show that the Offset Tree is an optimal reduction to binary classification. In particular, it has regret at most (k-1) times the regret of the binary classifier it uses (where k is the number of choices), and no reduction to binary classification can do better. This reduction is also computationally optimal, both at training and test time, requiring just O(log2 k) work to train on an example or make a prediction.Experiments with the Offset Tree show that it generally performs better than several alternative approaches.},

abstract = {Advanced analysis of data streams is quickly becoming a key area of data mining research as the number of applications demanding such processing increases. Online mining when such data streams evolve over time, that is when concepts drift or change completely, is becoming one of the core issues. When tackling non-stationary concepts, ensembles of classifiers have several advantages over single classifier methods: they are easy to scale and parallelize, they can adapt to change quickly by pruning under-performing parts of the ensemble, and they therefore usually also generate more accurate concept descriptions. This paper proposes a new experimental data stream framework for studying concept drift, and two new variants of Bagging: ADWIN Bagging and Adaptive-Size Hoeffding Tree (ASHT) Bagging. Using the new experimental framework, an evaluation study on synthetic and real-world datasets comprising up to ten million examples shows that the new ensemble methods perform very well compared to several known methods.},

abstract = {How can we automatically spot all outstanding observations in a data set? This question arises in a large variety of applications, e.g. in economy, biology and medicine. Existing approaches to outlier detection suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: The results of many methods strongly depend on suitable parameter settings being very difficult to estimate without background knowledge on the data, e.g. the minimum cluster size or the number of desired outliers. Many methods implicitly assume Gaussian or uniformly distributed data, and/or their result is difficult to interpret. To cope with these problems, we propose CoCo, a technique for parameter-free outlier detection. The basic idea of our technique relates outlier detection to data compression: Outliers are objects which can not be effectively compressed given the data set. To avoid the assumption of a certain data distribution, CoCo relies on a very general data model combining the Exponential Power Distribution with Independent Components. We define an intuitive outlier factor based on the principle of the Minimum Description Length together with an novel algorithm for outlier detection. An extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real world data demonstrates the benefits of our technique. Availability: The source code of CoCo and the data sets used in the experiments are available at: http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Forschung/KDD/Boehm/CoCo.},

This problem is challenging due to the requirement of high speed data processing within limited space cost. In this paper, we present a novel framework for monitoring anomalies over continuous trajectory streams. First, we illustrate the importance of distance-based anomaly monitoring over moving object trajectories. Then, we utilize the local continuity characteristics of trajectories to build local clusters upon trajectory streams and monitor anomalies via efficient pruning strategies. Finally, we propose a piecewise metric index structure to reschedule the joining order of local clusters to further reduce the time cost.

While many resources for networks of interesting entities are emerging, most of these can only annotate connections in a limited fashion. Although relationships between entities are rich, it is impractical to manually devise complete characterizations of these relationships for every pair of entities on large, real-world corpora.In this paper we present a novel probabilistic topic model to analyze text corpora and infer descriptions of its entities and of relationships between those entities. We develop variational methods for performing approximate inference on our model and demonstrate that our model can be practically deployed on large corpora such as Wikipedia.

abstract = {One common predictive modeling challenge occurs in text mining problems is that the training data and the operational (testing) data are drawn from different underlying distributions. This poses a great difficulty for many statistical learning methods. However, when the distribution in the source domain and the target domain are not identical but related, there may exist a shared concept space to preserve the relation. Consequently a good feature representation can encode this concept space and minimize the distribution gap. To formalize this intuition, we propose a domain adaptation method that parameterizes this concept space by linear transformation under which we explicitly minimize the distribution difference between the source domain with sufficient labeled data and target domains with only unlabeled data, while at the same time minimizing the empirical loss on the labeled data in the source domain. Another characteristic of our method is its capability for considering multiple classes and their interactions simultaneously. We have conducted extensive experiments on two common text mining problems, namely, information extraction and document classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Conditional random fields(CRFs) are a class of undirected graphical models which have been widely used for classifying and labeling sequence data. The training of CRFs is typically formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem that maximizes the conditional likelihood. However, maximum likelihood training is prone to overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a novel constrained nonlinear optimization formulation in which the prediction accuracy of cross-validation sets are included as constraints. Instead of requiring multiple passes of training, the constrained formulation allows the cross-validation be handled in one pass of constrained optimization.The new formulation is discontinuous, and classical Lagrangian based constraint handling methods are not applicable. A new constrained optimization algorithm based on the recently proposed extended saddle point theory is developed to learn the constrained CRF model. Experimental results on gene and stock-price prediction tasks show that the constrained formulation is able to significantly improve the generalization ability of CRF training.},

abstract = {Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small subset of nodes (seed nodes) in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. In this paper, we study the efficient influence maximization from two complementary directions. One is to improve the original greedy algorithm of [5] and its improvement [7] to further reduce its running time, and the second is to propose new degree discount heuristics that improves influence spread. We evaluate our algorithms by experiments on two large academic collaboration graphs obtained from the online archival database arXiv.org. Our experimental results show that (a) our improved greedy algorithm achieves better running time comparing with the improvement of [7] with matching influence spread, (b) our degree discount heuristics achieve much better influence spread than classic degree and centrality-based heuristics, and when tuned for a specific influence cascade model, it achieves almost matching influence thread with the greedy algorithm, and more importantly (c) the degree discount heuristics run only in milliseconds while even the improved greedy algorithms run in hours in our experiment graphs with a few tens of thousands of nodes.Based on our results, we believe that fine-tuned heuristics may provide truly scalable solutions to the influence maximization problem with satisfying influence spread and blazingly fast running time. Therefore, contrary to what implied by the conclusion of [5] that traditional heuristics are outperformed by the greedy approximation algorithm, our results shed new lights on the research of heuristic algorithms.},

The state-of-the-art of BT derives a linear Poisson regression model from fine-grained user behavioral data and predicts click-through rate (CTR) from user history. We designed and implemented a highly scalable and efficient solution to BT using Hadoop MapReduce framework. With our parallel algorithm and the resulting system, we can build above 450 BT-category models from the entire Yahoo's user base within one day, the scale that one can not even imagine with prior systems. Moreover, our approach has yielded 20% CTR lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset.Specifically, our major contributions include: (1) A MapReduce statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal data parallelism, task parallelism, and load balance in spite of the typically skewed distribution of domain data. (2) An in-place feature vector generation algorithm with linear time complexity O(n) regardless of the granularity of sliding target window. (3) An in-memory caching scheme that significantly reduces the number of disk IOs to make large-scale learning practical. (4) Highly efficient data structures and sparse representations of models and data to enable fast model updates. We believe that our work makes significant contributions to solving large-scale machine learning problems of industrial relevance in general.

We show that some of the problems are NP-hard yet admit effective heuristics, some of which can exploit properties of social networks such as link reciprocity. Our extensive experiments show that social networks and the Web graph exhibit vastly different compressibility characteristics.},

For each query, ranking is applied to order a set of relevant items from which the user selects his favorite. This is the case when ranking search results for pages on the World Wide Web or for merchandize on an e-commerce site. In this work, we present a new online ranking algorithm, called NoRegret KLRank. Our algorithm is designed to use "clickthrough" information as it is provided by the users to improve future ranking decisions. More importantly, we show that its long term average performance will converge to the best rate achievable by any competing fixed ranking policy selected with the benefit of hindsight. We show how to ensure that this property continues to hold as new items are added to the set thus requiring a richer class of ranking policies. Finally, our empirical results show that, while in some context NoRegret KLRank might be considered conservative, a greedy variant of this algorithm actually outperforms many popular ranking algorithms.},

abstract = {Recently many data types arising from data mining and Web search applications can be modeled as bipartite graphs. Examples include queries and URLs in query logs, and authors and papers in scientific literature. However, one of the issues is that previous algorithms only consider the content and link information from one side of the bipartite graph. There is a lack of constraints to make sure the final relevance of the score propagation on the graph, as there are many noisy edges within the bipartite graph. In this paper, we propose a novel and general Co-HITS algorithm to incorporate the bipartite graph with the content information from both sides as well as the constraints of relevance. Moreover, we investigate the algorithm based on two frameworks, including the iterative and the regularization frameworks, and illustrate the generalized Co-HITS algorithm from different views. For the iterative framework, it contains HITS and personalized PageRank as special cases. In the regularization framework, we successfully build a connection with HITS, and develop a new cost function to consider the direct relationship between two entity sets, which leads to a significant improvement over the baseline method. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the Co-HITS algorithm, with many different settings, to the application of query suggestion by mining the AOL query log data. Experimental results demonstrate that CoRegu-0.5 (i.e., a model of the regularization framework) achieves the best performance with consistent and promising improvements.},

This is particularly important in cases where due to finite resources or domain requirements, one wants to make decisions based only on the most reliable rather than on the entire set of predictions. This paper introduces novel and effective ways of ranking predictions by their accuracy for problems involving large-scale, heterogeneous data with a dyadic structure, i.e., where the independent variables can be naturally decomposed into three groups associated with two sets of elements and their combination. These approaches are based on modeling the data by a collection of localized models learnt while simultaneously partitioning (co-clustering) the data. For regression this leads to the concept of "certainty lift". We also develop a robust predictive modeling technique that identifies and models only the most coherent regions of the data to give high predictive accuracy on the selected subset of response values. Extensive experimentation on real life datasets highlights the utility of our proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Many scalable data mining tasks rely on active learning to provide the most useful accurately labeled instances. However, what if there are multiple labeling sources ('oracles' or 'experts') with different but unknown reliabilities? With the recent advent of inexpensive and scalable online annotation tools, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, the labeling process has become more vulnerable to noise - and without prior knowledge of the accuracy of each individual labeler. This paper addresses exactly such a challenge: how to jointly learn the accuracy of labeling sources and obtain the most informative labels for the active learning task at hand minimizing total labeling effort. More specifically, we present IEThresh (Interval Estimate Threshold) as a strategy to intelligently select the expert(s) with the highest estimated labeling accuracy. IEThresh estimates a confidence interval for the reliability of each expert and filters out the one(s) whose estimated upper-bound confidence interval is below a threshold - which jointly optimizes expected accuracy (mean) and need to better estimate the expert's accuracy (variance). Our framework is flexible enough to work with a wide range of different noise levels and outperforms baselines such as asking all available experts and random expert selection. In particular, IEThresh achieves a given level of accuracy with less than half the queries issued by all-experts labeling and less than a third the queries required by random expert selection on datasets such as the UCI mushroom one. The results show that our method naturally balances exploration and exploitation as it gains knowledge of which experts to rely upon, and selects them with increasing frequency.},

abstract = {For a training dataset with a nonexhaustive list of classes, i.e. some classes are not yet known and hence are not represented, the resulting learning problem is ill-defined. In this case a sample from a missing class is incorrectly classified to one of the existing classes. For some applications the cost of misclassifying a sample could be negligible. However, the significance of this problem can better be acknowledged when the potentially undesirable consequences of incorrectly classifying a food pathogen as a nonpathogen are considered. Our research is directed towards the real-time detection of food pathogens using optical-scattering technology. Bacterial colonies consisting of the progeny of a single parent cell scatter light at 635 nm to produce unique forward-scatter signatures. These spectral signatures contain descriptive characteristics of bacterial colonies, which can be used to identify bacteria cultures in real time. One bottleneck that remains to be addressed is the nonexhaustive nature of the training library. It is very difficult if not impractical to collect samples from all possible bacteria colonies and construct a digital library with an exhaustive set of scatter signatures. This study deals with the real-time detection of samples from a missing class and the associated problem of learning with a nonexhaustive training dataset. Our proposed method assumes a common prior for the set of all classes, known and missing. The parameters of the prior are estimated from the samples of the known classes. This prior is then used to generate a large number of samples to simulate the space of missing classes. Finally a Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier is implemented using samples from real as well as simulated classes. Experiments performed with samples collected for 28 bacteria subclasses favor the proposed approach over the state of the art.},

abstract = {In recent years, the blogosphere has experienced a substantial increase in the number of posts published daily, forcing users to cope with information overload. The task of guiding users through this flood of information has thus become critical. To address this issue, we present a principled approach for picking a set of posts that best covers the important stories in the blogosphere.We define a simple and elegant notion of coverage and formalize it as a submodular optimization problem, for which we can efficiently compute a near-optimal solution. In addition, since people have varied interests, the ideal coverage algorithm should incorporate user preferences in order to tailor the selected posts to individual tastes. We define the problem of learning a personalized coverage function by providing an appropriate user-interaction model and formalizing an online learning framework for this task. We then provide a no-regret algorithm which can quickly learn a user's preferences from limited feedback.We evaluate our coverage and personalization algorithms extensively over real blog data. Results from a user study show that our simple coverage algorithm does as well as most popular blog aggregation sites, including Google Blog Search, Yahoo! Buzz, and Digg. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that our algorithm can successfully adapt to user preferences. We believe that our technique, especially with personalization, can dramatically reduce information overload.},

abstract = {Linear classifiers have been shown to be effective for many discrimination tasks. Irrespective of the learning algorithm itself, the final classifier has a weight to multiply by each feature. This suggests that ideally each input feature should be linearly correlated with the target variable (or anti-correlated), whereas raw features may be highly non-linear. In this paper, we attempt to re-shape each input feature so that it is appropriate to use with a linear weight and to scale the different features in proportion to their predictive value. We demonstrate that this pre-processing is beneficial for linear SVM classifiers on a large benchmark of text classification tasks as well as UCI datasets.},

abstract = {Spatial classification is the task of learning models to predict class labels based on the features of entities as well as the spatial relationships to other entities and their features. Spatial data can be represented as multi-relational data, however it presents novel challenges not present in multi-relational problems. One such problem is that spatial relationships are embedded in space, unknown a priori, and it is part of the algorithm's task to determine which relationships are important and what properties to consider. In order to determine when two entities are spatially related in an adaptive and non-parametric way, we propose a Voronoi-based neighbourhood definition upon which spatial literals can be built. Properties of these neighbourhoods also need to be described and used for classification purposes. Non-spatial aggregation literals already exist within the multi-relational framework, but are not sufficient for comprehensive spatial classification. A formal set of additions to the multi-relational data mining framework is proposed, to be able to represent spatial aggregations as well as spatial features and literals. These additions allow for capturing more complex interactions and spatial occurrences such as spatial trends. In order to more efficiently perform the rule learning and exploit powerful multi-processor machines, a scalable parallelized method capable of reducing the runtime by several factors is presented. The method is compared against existing methods by experimental evaluation on a real world crime dataset which demonstrate the importance of the neighbourhood definition and the advantages of parallelization.},

abstract = {Learning probabilistic graphical models from high-dimensional datasets is a computationally challenging task. In many interesting applications, the domain dimensionality is such as to prevent state-of-the-art statistical learning techniques from delivering accurate models in reasonable time. This paper presents a hybrid random field model for pseudo-likelihood estimation in high-dimensional domains. A theoretical analysis proves that the class of pseudo-likelihood distributions representable by hybrid random fields strictly includes the class of joint probability distributions representable by Bayesian networks. In order to learn hybrid random fields from data, we develop the Markov Blanket Merging algorithm. Theoretical and experimental evidence shows that Markov Blanket Merging scales up very well to high-dimensional datasets. As compared to other widely used statistical learning techniques, Markov Blanket Merging delivers accurate results in a number of link prediction tasks, while achieving also significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency.Our software implementation of the models investigated in this paper is publicly available at http://www.dii.unisi.it/~freno/.

abstract = {Learning from data streams is a research area of increasing importance. Nowadays, several stream learning algorithms have been developed. Most of them learn decision models that continuously evolve over time, run in resource-aware environments, detect and react to changes in the environment generating data. One important issue, not yet conveniently addressed, is the design of experimental work to evaluate and compare decision models that evolve over time. There are no golden standards for assessing performance in non-stationary environments. This paper proposes a general framework for assessing predictive stream learning algorithms. We defend the use of Predictive Sequential methods for error estimate - the prequential error. The prequential error allows us to monitor the evolution of the performance of models that evolve over time. Nevertheless, it is known to be a pessimistic estimator in comparison to holdout estimates. To obtain more reliable estimators we need some forgetting mechanism. Two viable alternatives are: sliding windows and fading factors. We observe that the prequential error converges to an holdout estimator when estimated over a sliding window or using fading factors. We present illustrative examples of the use of prequential error estimators, using fading factors, for the tasks of: i) assessing performance of a learning algorithm; ii) comparing learning algorithms; iii) hypothesis testing using McNemar test; and iv) change detection using Page-Hinkley test. In these tasks, the prequential error estimated using fading factors provide reliable estimators. In comparison to sliding windows, fading factors are faster and memory-less, a requirement for streaming applications. This paper is a contribution to a discussion in the good-practices on performance assessment when learning dynamic models that evolve over time.},

abstract = {Nowadays, enormous amounts of data are continuously generated not only in massive scale, but also from different, sometimes conflicting, views. Therefore, it is important to consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making. For example, to predict the research areas of some people, the best results are usually achieved by combining and consolidating predictions obtained from the publication network, co-authorship network and the textual content of their publications. Multiple supervised and unsupervised hypotheses can be drawn from these information sources, and negotiating their differences and consolidating decisions usually yields a much more accurate model due to the diversity and heterogeneity of these models. In this paper, we address the problem of "consensus learning" among competing hypotheses, which either rely on outside knowledge (supervised learning) or internal structure (unsupervised clustering). We argue that consensus learning is an NP-hard problem and thus propose to solve it by an efficient heuristic method. We construct a belief graph to first propagate predictions from supervised models to the unsupervised, and then negotiate and reach consensus among them. Their final decision is further consolidated by calculating each model's weight based on its degree of consistency with other models. Experiments are conducted on 20 Newsgroups data, Cora research papers, DBLP author-conference network, and Yahoo! Movies datasets, and the results show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy and the clustering quality measure (NMI) over the best base model by up to 10%. Furthermore, it runs in time proportional to the number of instances, which is very efficient for large scale data sets.},

abstract = {In this study, we formalize a multi-focal learning problem, where training data are partitioned into several different focal groups and the prediction model will be learned within each focal group. The multi-focal learning problem is motivated by numerous real-world learning applications. For instance, for the same type of problems encountered in a customer service center, the problem descriptions from different customers can be quite different. The experienced customers usually give more precise and focused descriptions about the problem. In contrast, the inexperienced customers usually provide more diverse descriptions. In this case, the examples from the same class in the training data can be naturally in different focal groups. As a result, it is necessary to identify those natural focal groups and exploit them for learning at different focuses. The key developmental challenge is how to identify those focal groups in the training data. As a case study, we exploit multi-focal learning for profiling problems in customer service centers. The results show that multifocal learning can significantly boost the learning accuracies of existing learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for classifying customer problems.},

abstract = {Co-clustering is based on the duality between data points (e.g. documents) and features (e.g. words), i.e. data points can be grouped based on their distribution on features, while features can be grouped based on their distribution on the data points. In the past decade, several co-clustering algorithms have been proposed and shown to be superior to traditional one-side clustering. However, existing co-clustering algorithms fail to consider the geometric structure in the data, which is essential for clustering data on manifold. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dual Regularized Co-Clustering (DRCC) method based on semi-nonnegative matrix tri-factorization. We deem that not only the data points, but also the features are sampled from some manifolds, namely data manifold and feature manifold respectively. As a result, we construct two graphs, i.e. data graph and feature graph, to explore the geometric structure of data manifold and feature manifold. Then our co-clustering method is formulated as semi-nonnegative matrix tri-factorization with two graph regularizers, requiring that the cluster labels of data points are smooth with respect to the data manifold, while the cluster labels of features are smooth with respect to the feature manifold. We will show that DRCC can be solved via alternating minimization, and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Experiments of clustering on many benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state of the art clustering methods.},

abstract = {Various online social networks (OSNs) have been developed rapidly on the Internet. Researchers have analyzed different properties of such OSNs, mainly focusing on the formation and evolution of the networks as well as the information propagation over the networks. In knowledge-sharing OSNs, such as blogs and question answering systems, issues on how users participate in the network and how users "generate/contribute" knowledge are vital to the sustained and healthy growth of the networks. However, related discussions have not been reported in the research literature.In this work, we empirically study workloads from three popular knowledge-sharing OSNs, including a blog system, a social bookmark sharing network, and a question answering social network to examine these properties. Our analysis consistently shows that (1) users' posting behavior in these networks exhibits strong daily and weekly patterns, but the user active time in these OSNs does not follow exponential distributions; (2) the user posting behavior in these OSNs follows stretched exponential distributions instead of power-law distributions, indicating the influence of a small number of core users cannot dominate the network; (3) the distributions of user contributions on high-quality and effort-consuming contents in these OSNs have smaller stretch factors for the stretched exponential distribution. Our study provides insights into user activity patterns and lays out an analytical foundation for further understanding various properties of these OSNs.},

abstract = {There is a wide variety of data mining methods available, and it is generally useful in exploratory data analysis to use many different methods for the same dataset. This, however, leads to the problem of whether the results found by one method are a reflection of the phenomenon shown by the results of another method, or whether the results depict in some sense unrelated properties of the data. For example, using clustering can give indication of a clear cluster structure, and computing correlations between variables can show that there are many significant correlations in the data. However, it can be the case that the correlations are actually determined by the cluster structure.In this paper, we consider the problem of randomizing data so that previously discovered patterns or models are taken into account. The randomization methods can be used in iterative data mining. At each step in the data mining process, the randomization produces random samples from the set of data matrices satisfying the already discovered patterns or models. That is, given a data set and some statistics (e.g., cluster centers or co-occurrence counts) of the data, the randomization methods sample data sets having similar values of the given statistics as the original data set. We use Metropolis sampling based on local swaps to achieve this. We describe experiments on real data that demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. Our results indicate that in many cases, the results of, e.g., clustering actually imply the results of, say, frequent pattern discovery.},

abstract = {In traditional text clustering methods, documents are represented as "bags of words" without considering the semantic information of each document. For instance, if two documents use different collections of core words to represent the same topic, they may be falsely assigned to different clusters due to the lack of shared core words, although the core words they use are probably synonyms or semantically associated in other forms. The most common way to solve this problem is to enrich document representation with the background knowledge in an ontology. There are two major issues for this approach: (1) the coverage of the ontology is limited, even for WordNet or Mesh, (2) using ontology terms as replacement or additional features may cause information loss, or introduce noise. In this paper, we present a novel text clustering method to address these two issues by enriching document representation with Wikipedia concept and category information. We develop two approaches, exact match and relatedness-match, to map text documents to Wikipedia concepts, and further to Wikipedia categories. Then the text documents are clustered based on a similarity metric which combines document content information, concept information as well as category information. The experimental results using the proposed clustering framework on three datasets (20-newsgroup, TDT2, and LA Times) show that clustering performance improves significantly by enriching document representation with Wikipedia concepts and categories.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trust-based approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision. In order to find a good trade-off, we propose a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation. The random walk model allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset and compared our model with existing trust-based and collaborative filtering methods.},

abstract = {The Drosophila gene expression pattern images document the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression and they are valuable tools for explicating the gene functions, interaction, and networks during Drosophila embryogenesis. To provide text-based pattern searching, the images in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) study are annotated with ontology terms manually by human curators. We present a systematic approach for automating this task, because the number of images needing text descriptions is now rapidly increasing. We consider both improved feature representation and novel learning formulation to boost the annotation performance. For feature representation, we adapt the bag-of-words scheme commonly used in visual recognition problems so that the image group information in the BDGP study is retained. Moreover, images from multiple views can be integrated naturally in this representation. To reduce the quantization error caused by the bag-of-words representation, we propose an improved feature representation scheme based on the sparse learning technique. In the design of learning formulation, we propose a local regularization framework that can incorporate the correlations among terms explicitly. We further show that the resulting optimization problem admits an analytical solution. Experimental results show that the representation based on sparse learning outperforms the bag-of-words representation significantly. Results also show that incorporation of the term-term correlations improves the annotation performance consistently.},

More interestingly, it takes a first step in deriving a generative view of the frequent pattern formulation, i.e., how a small number of patterns interact with each other and produce the complexity of frequent itemsets. We perform a theoretical investigation of the concise representation problem and link it to the biclique set cover problem and prove its NP-hardness. We develop a novel approach utilizing the technique developed in frequent itemset mining, set cover, and max k-cover to approximate the minimal biclique set cover problem. In addition, we consider several heuristic techniques to speedup the construction of Cartesian contour. The detailed experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

Relatively little is understood, as to how the natural label noise distribution can be measured or simulated. Using email spam-filtering data, we demonstrate that class noise can have substantial content specific bias. We also demonstrate that noise detection techniques based on classifier confidence tend to identify instances that human assessors are likely to label in error. We show that genre modeling can be very informative in identifying potential areas of mislabeling. Moreover, we are able to show that genre decomposition can also be used to substantially improve spam filtering accuracy, with our results outperforming the best published figures for the trec05-p1 and ceas-2008 benchmark collections.},

abstract = {Research in relational data mining has two major directions: finding global models of a relational database and the discovery of local relational patterns within a database. While relational patterns show how attribute values co-occur in detail, their huge numbers hamper their usage in data analysis. Global models, on the other hand, only provide a summary of how different tables and their attributes relate to each other, lacking detail of what is going on at the local level.In this paper we introduce a new approach that combines the positive properties of both directions: it provides a detailed description of the complete database using a small set of patterns. More in particular, we utilise a rich pattern language and show how a database can be encoded by such patterns. Then, based on the MDLprinciple, the novel RDB-KRIMP algorithm selects the set of patterns that allows for the most succinct encoding of the database. This set, the code table, is a compact description of the database in terms of local relational patterns. We show that this resulting set is very small, both in terms of database size and in number of its local relational patterns: a reduction of up to 4 orders of magnitude is attained.},

abstract = {Customer preferences for products are drifting over time. Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics should be a key when designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the eco-system intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance-decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too much signal when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long term patterns. The paradigm we offer is creating a model tracking the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. This allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie rating dataset by Netflix. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset.},

abstract = {To take the first step beyond keyword-based search toward entity-based search, suitable token spans ("spots") on documents must be identified as references to real-world entities from an entity catalog. Several systems have been proposed to link spots on Web pages to entities in Wikipedia. They are largely based on local compatibility between the text around the spot and textual metadata associated with the entity. Two recent systems exploit inter-label dependencies, but in limited ways. We propose a general collective disambiguation approach. Our premise is that coherent documents refer to entities from one or a few related topics or domains. We give formulations for the trade-off between local spot-to-entity compatibility and measures of global coherence between entities. Optimizing the overall entity assignment is NP-hard. We investigate practical solutions based on local hill-climbing, rounding integer linear programs, and pre-clustering entities followed by local optimization within clusters. In experiments involving over a hundred manually-annotated Web pages and tens of thousands of spots, our approaches significantly outperform recently-proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {Overall performance of the data mining process depends not just on the value of the induced knowledge but also on various costs of the process itself such as the cost of acquiring and pre-processing training examples, the CPU cost of model induction, and the cost of committed errors. Recently, several progressive sampling strategies for maximizing the overall data mining utility have been proposed. All these strategies are based on repeated acquisitions of additional training examples until a utility decrease is observed. In this paper, we present an alternative, projective sampling strategy, which fits functions to a partial learning curve and a partial run-time curve obtained from a small subset of potentially available data and then uses these projected functions to analytically estimate the optimal training set size. The proposed approach is evaluated on a variety of benchmark datasets using the RapidMiner environment for machine learning and data mining processes. The results show that the learning and run-time curves projected from only several data points can lead to a cheaper data mining process than the common progressive sampling methods.},

abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events.We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.},

abstract = {In data publishing, anonymization techniques such as generalization and bucketization have been designed to provide privacy protection. In the meanwhile, they reduce the utility of the data. It is important to consider the tradeoff between privacy and utility. In a paper that appeared in KDD 2008, Brickell and Shmatikov proposed an evaluation methodology by comparing privacy gain with utility gain resulted from anonymizing the data, and concluded that "even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility". This conclusion seems to undermine existing work on data anonymization. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental characteristics of privacy and utility, and show that it is inappropriate to directly compare privacy with utility. We then observe that the privacy-utility tradeoff in data publishing is similar to the risk-return tradeoff in financial investment, and propose an integrated framework for considering privacy-utility tradeoff, borrowing concepts from the Modern Portfolio Theory for financial investment. Finally, we evaluate our methodology on the Adult dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. Our results clarify several common misconceptions about data utility and provide data publishers useful guidelines on choosing the right tradeoff between privacy and utility.},

abstract = {This paper aims at discovering community structure in rich media social networks, through analysis of time-varying, multi-relational data. Community structure represents the latent social context of user actions. It has important applications in information tasks such as search and recommendation. Social media has several unique challenges. (a) In social media, the context of user actions is constantly changing and co-evolving; hence the social context contains time-evolving multi-dimensional relations. (b) The social context is determined by the available system features and is unique in each social media website. In this paper we propose MetaFac (MetaGraph Factorization), a framework that extracts community structures from various social contexts and interactions. Our work has three key contributions: (1) metagraph, a novel relational hypergraph representation for modeling multi-relational and multi-dimensional social data; (2) an efficient factorization method for community extraction on a given metagraph; (3) an on-line method to handle time-varying relations through incremental metagraph factorization. Extensive experiments on real-world social data collected from the Digg social media website suggest that our technique is scalable and is able to extract meaningful communities based on the social media contexts. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through prediction tasks. We outperform baseline methods (including aspect model and tensor analysis) by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Logistic Regression is a well-known classification method that has been used widely in many applications of data mining, machine learning, computer vision, and bioinformatics. Sparse logistic regression embeds feature selection in the classification framework using the l1-norm regularization, and is attractive in many applications involving high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose Lassplore for solving large-scale sparse logistic regression. Specifically, we formulate the problem as the l1-ball constrained smooth convex optimization, and propose to solve the problem using the Nesterov's method, an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. One of the critical issues in the use of the Nesterov's method is the estimation of the step size at each of the optimization iterations. Previous approaches either applies the constant step size which assumes that the Lipschitz gradient is known in advance, or requires a sequence of decreasing step size which leads to slow convergence in practice. In this paper, we propose an adaptive line search scheme which allows to tune the step size adaptively and meanwhile guarantees the optimal convergence rate. Empirical comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed Lassplore algorithm for large-scale problems.},

Due to the difficulty and complexity of software systems, bugs and anomalies are prevalent. Bugs have caused billions of dollars loss, in addition to privacy and security threats. In this work, we address software reliability issues by proposing a novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs. With the technique, it is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures and anomalies. Our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitive series of events from program execution traces. It then performs feature selection to select the best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to detect failures. Experiments and case studies on traces of several benchmark software systems and a real-life concurrency bug from MySQL server show the utility of the technique in capturing failures and anomalies. On average, our pattern-based classification technique outperforms the baseline approach by 24.68% in accuracy.},

Graphical Granger modeling uses graphical modeling techniques on time series data and invokes the notion of "Granger causality" to make assertions on causality among a potentially large number of time series variables through inference on time-lagged effects. The present paper proposes a novel enhancement to the graphical Granger methodology by developing and applying families of regression methods that are sensitive to group information among variables, to leverage the group structure present in the lagged temporal variables according to the time series they belong to. Additionally, we propose a new family of algorithms we call group boosting, as an improved component of grouped graphical Granger modeling over the existing regression methods with grouped variable selection in the literature (e.g group Lasso). The introduction of group boosting methods is primarily motivated by the need to deal with non-linearity in the data. We perform empirical evaluation to confirm the advantage of the grouped graphical Granger methods over the standard (non-grouped) methods, as well as that specific to the methods based on group boosting. This advantage is also demonstrated for the real world application of gene regulatory network discovery from time-course microarray data.},

We propose an alternative, data centric, approach that relies on actual measurements of climate observations and human and natural forcing factors. Specifically, we develop a novel method to infer causality from spatial-temporal data, as well as a procedure to incorporate extreme value modeling into our method in order to address the attribution of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves. Our experimental results on a real world dataset indicate that changes in temperature are not solely accounted for by solar radiance, but attributed more significantly to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Combined with extreme value modeling, we also show that there has been a significant increase in the intensity of extreme temperatures, and that such changes in extreme temperature are also attributable to greenhouse gases. These preliminary results suggest that our approach can offer a useful alternative to the simulation-based approach to climate modeling and attribution, and provide valuable insights from a fresh perspective.},

abstract = {Active and semi-supervised learning are important techniques when labeled data are scarce. Recently a method was suggested for combining active learning with a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses Gaussian fields and harmonic functions. This classifier is relational in nature: it relies on having the data presented as a partially labeled graph (also known as a within-network learning problem). This work showed yet again that empirical risk minimization (ERM) was the best method to find the next instance to label and provided an efficient way to compute ERM with the semi-supervised classifier. The computational problem with ERM is that it relies on computing the risk for all possible instances. If we could limit the candidates that should be investigated, then we can speed up active learning considerably. In the case where the data is graphical in nature, we can leverage the graph structure to rapidly identify instances that are likely to be good candidates for labeling. This paper describes a novel hybrid approach of using of community finding and social network analytic centrality measures to identify good candidates for labeling and then using ERM to find the best instance in this candidate set. We show on real-world data that we can limit the ERM computations to a fraction of instances with comparable performance.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of electronic communication data, such as that arising from e-mail exchange, presents social and information scientists with new possibilities for characterizing individual behavior and, by extension, identifying latent structure in human populations. Here, we propose a model of individual e-mail communication that is sufficiently rich to capture meaningful variability across individuals, while remaining simple enough to be interpretable. We show that the model, a cascading non-homogeneous Poisson process, can be formulated as a double-chain hidden Markov model, allowing us to use an efficient inference algorithm to estimate the model parameters from observed data. We then apply this model to two e-mail data sets consisting of 404 and 6,164 users, respectively, that were collected from two universities in different countries and years. We find that the resulting best-estimate parameter distributions for both data sets are surprisingly similar, indicating that at least some features of communication dynamics generalize beyond specific contexts. We also find that variability of individual behavior over time is significantly less than variability across the population, suggesting that individuals can be classified into persistent "types". We conclude that communication patterns may prove useful as an additional class of attribute data, complementing demographic and network data, for user classification and outlier detection-a point that we illustrate with an interpretable clustering of users based on their inferred model parameters.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to large-scale graph mining based on so-called backbone refinement classes. The method efficiently mines tree-shaped subgraph descriptors under minimum frequency and significance constraints, using classes of fragments to reduce feature set size and running times. The classes are defined in terms of fragments sharing a common backbone. The method is able to optimize structural inter-feature entropy as opposed to occurrences, which is characteristic for open or closed fragment mining. In the experiments, the proposed method reduces feature set sizes by &gt;90 % and &gt;30 % compared to complete tree mining and open tree mining, respectively. Evaluation using crossvalidation runs shows that their classification accuracy is similar to the complete set of trees but significantly better than that of open trees. Compared to open or closed fragment mining, a large part of the search space can be pruned due to an improved statistical constraint (dynamic upper bound adjustment), which is also confirmed in the experiments in lower running times compared to ordinary (static) upper bound pruning. Further analysis using large-scale datasets yields insight into important properties of the proposed descriptors, such as the dataset coverage and the class size represented by each descriptor. A final cross-validation run confirms that the novel descriptors render large training sets feasible which previously might have been intractable.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of producing recommendations from collective user behavior while simultaneously providing guarantees of privacy for these users. Specifically, we consider the Netflix Prize data set, and its leading algorithms, adapted to the framework of differential privacy.Unlike prior privacy work concerned with cryptographically securing the computation of recommendations, differential privacy constrains a computation in a way that precludes any inference about the underlying records from its output. Such algorithms necessarily introduce uncertainty--i.e., noise--to computations, trading accuracy for privacy.We find that several of the leading approaches in the Netflix Prize competition can be adapted to provide differential privacy, without significantly degrading their accuracy. To adapt these algorithms, we explicitly factor them into two parts, an aggregation/learning phase that can be performed with differential privacy guarantees, and an individual recommendation phase that uses the learned correlations and an individual's data to provide personalized recommendations. The adaptations are non-trivial, and involve both careful analysis of the per-record sensitivity of the algorithms to calibrate noise, as well as new post-processing steps to mitigate the impact of this noise.We measure the empirical trade-off between accuracy and privacy in these adaptations, and find that we can provide non-trivial formal privacy guarantees while still outperforming the Cinematch baseline Netflix provides.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of mobile devices and location based services is leading to an increasing volume of mobility data.This side eect provides the opportunity for innovative methods that analyse the behaviors of movements. In this paper we propose WhereNext, which is a method aimed at predicting with a certain level of accuracy the next location of a moving object. The prediction uses previously extracted movement patterns named Trajectory Patterns, which are a concise representation of behaviors of moving objects as sequences of regions frequently visited with a typical travel time. A decision tree, named T-pattern Tree, is built and evaluated with a formal training and test process. The tree is learned from the Trajectory Patterns that hold a certain area and it may be used as a predictor of the next location of a new trajectory finding the best matching path in the tree. Three dierent best matching methods to classify a new moving object are proposed and their impact on the quality of prediction is studied extensively. Using Trajectory Patterns as predictive rules has the following implications: (I) the learning depends on the movement of all available objects in a certain area instead of on the individual history of an object; (II) the prediction tree intrinsically contains the spatio-temporal properties that have emerged from the data and this allows us to define matching methods that striclty depend on the properties of such movements. In addition, we propose a set of other measures, that evaluate a priori the predictive power of a set of Trajectory Patterns. This measures were tuned on a real life case study. Finally, an exhaustive set of experiments and results on the real dataset are presented.},

abstract = {Most of recommender systems try to find items that are most relevant to the older choices of a given user. Here we focus on the "surprise me" query: A user may be bored with his/her usual genre of items (e.g., books, movies, hobbies), and may want a recommendation that is related, but off the beaten path, possibly leading to a new genre of books/movies/hobbies.How would we define, as well as automate, this seemingly selfcontradicting request? We introduce TANGENT, a novel recommendation algorithm to solve this problem. The main idea behind TANGENT is to envision the problem as node selection on a graph, giving high scores to nodes that are well connected to the older choices, and at the same time well connected to unrelated choices. The method is carefully designed to be (a) parameter-free (b) effective and (c) fast. We illustrate the benefits of TANGENT with experiments on both synthetic and real data sets. We show that TANGENT makes reasonable, yet surprising, horizon-broadening recommendations. Moreover, it is fast and scalable, since it can easily use existing fast algorithms on graph node proximity.},

Typical characteristics include: Only positive examples can be observed, classes are highly imbalanced, and the vast majority of data points are missing. The idea of introducing weights for missing parts of a matrix has recently been shown to help in OCCF. While existing weighting approaches mitigate the first two problems above, a sparsity preserving solution that would allow to efficiently utilize data sets with e.g., hundred thousands of users and items has not yet been reported. In this paper, we study three different collaborative filtering frameworks: Low-rank matrix approximation, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, and maximum-margin matrix factorization. We propose two novel algorithms for large-scale OCCF that allow to weight the unknowns. Our experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency on different problems, including the Netflix Prize data.},

abstract = {The discovery of biclusters, which denote groups of items that show coherent values across a subset of all the transactions in a data set, is an important type of analysis performed on real-valued data sets in various domains, such as biology. Several algorithms have been proposed to find different types of biclusters in such data sets. However, these algorithms are unable to search the space of all possible biclusters exhaustively. Pattern mining algorithms in association analysis also essentially produce biclusters as their result, since the patterns consist of items that are supported by a subset of all the transactions. However, a major limitation of the numerous techniques developed in association analysis is that they are only able to analyze data sets with binary and/or categorical variables, and their application to real-valued data sets often involves some lossy transformation such as discretization or binarization of the attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel association analysis framework for exhaustively and efficiently mining "range support" patterns from such a data set. On one hand, this framework reduces the loss of information incurred by the binarization- and discretization-based approaches, and on the other, it enables the exhaustive discovery of coherent biclusters. We compared the performance of our framework with two standard biclustering algorithms through the evaluation of the similarity of the cellular functions of the genes constituting the patterns/biclusters derived by these algorithms from microarray data. These experiments show that the real-valued patterns discovered by our framework are better enriched by small biologically interesting functional classes. Also, through specific examples, we demonstrate the ability of the RAP framework to discover functionally enriched patterns that are not found by the commonly used biclustering algorithm ISA.

Several features of our proposed summary are: (1) each profile in the summary can be analyzed independently, (2) it provides error guarantee (ε-adequate), and (3) it produces no false positives or false negatives.Having the formulation, the next challenge is to produce the most concise summary which satisfies the requirement. In this paper, we also designed an algorithm which is both effective and efficient for this task. The quality of our approach is justified by extensive experiments.The implementations for the algorithms are available from www.cais.ntu.edu.sg/~vivek/pubs/cprofile09.},

However, despite growing interest in this field, no previous approach mines proportional FTFIs with their exact support (FT-support).This problem is difficult because of two concerns: (a) non anti-monotonic property of FT-support when relaxation is proportional, and (b) difficulty in computing FT-support. Previous efforts on this problem either simplify the general problem by adding constraints, or provide approximate solutions without any error guarantees.In this paper, we address these concerns in the general FTFI mining problem. We limit the search space by providing provably correct anti monotone bounds for FT-support and develop practically efficient means of achieving them. Besides, we also provide an efficient and exact FT-support counting procedure.Extensive experiments using real datasets validate that our solution is reasonably efficient for completely mining FTFIs.

Targeting social-network neighbors resonates well with advertisers, and on-line browsing behavior data counterintuitively can allow the identification of good audiences anonymously. Besides being one of the first papers to our knowledge on data mining for on-line brand advertising, this paper makes several important contributions. We introduce a framework for evaluating brand audiences, in analogy to predictive-modeling holdout evaluation. We introduce methods for extracting quasi-social networks from data on visitations to social networking pages, without collecting any information on the identities of the browsers or the content of the social-network pages. We introduce measures of brand proximity in the network, and show that audiences with high brand proximity indeed show substantially higher brand affinity. Finally, we provide evidence that the quasi-social network embeds a true social network, which along with results from social theory offers one explanation for the increase in brand affinity of the selected audiences.},

However, most algorithms typically just find a single (possibly non-novel/actionable) interpretation of the data even though alternatives could exist. The problem of finding an alternative to a given original clustering has received little attention in the literature. Current techniques (including our previous work) are unfocused/unrefined in that they broadly attempt to find an alternative clustering but do not specify which properties of the original clustering should or should not be retained. In this work, we explore a principled and flexible framework in order to find alternative clusterings of the data. The approach is principled since it poses a constrained optimization problem, so its exact behavior is understood. It is flexible since the user can formally specify positive and negative feedback based on the existing clustering, which ranges from which clusters to keep (or not) to making a trade-off between alternativeness and clustering quality.},

abstract = {Tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item. This is important for many websites with tagging capabilities like last.fm or delicious. In this paper, we propose a method for tag recommendation based on tensor factorization (TF). In contrast to other TF methods like higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), our method RTF ('ranking with tensor factorization') directly optimizes the factorization model for the best personalized ranking. RTF handles missing values and learns from pairwise ranking constraints. Our optimization criterion for TF is motivated by a detailed analysis of the problem and of interpretation schemes for the observed data in tagging systems. In all, RTF directly optimizes for the actual problem using a correct interpretation of the data. We provide a gradient descent algorithm to solve our optimization problem. We also provide an improved learning and prediction method with runtime complexity analysis for RTF. The prediction runtime of RTF is independent of the number of observations and only depends on the factorization dimensions. Besides the theoretical analysis, we empirically show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art tag recommendation methods like FolkRank, PageRank and HOSVD both in quality and prediction runtime.},

In this article we present a multi-level algorithm for graph clustering using flows that delivers significant improvements in both quality and speed. The graph is first successively coarsened to a manageable size, and a small number of iterations of flow simulation is performed on the coarse graph. The graph is then successively refined, with flows from the previous graph used as initializations for brief flow simulations on each of the intermediate graphs. When we reach the final refined graph, the algorithm is run to convergence and the high-flow regions are clustered together, with regions without any flow forming the natural boundaries of the clusters. Extensive experimental results on several real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

We also present empirical justification for some of the modeling assumptions made in dynamic network analysis (e.g., first-order Markovian assumption) and develop metrics to measure the alignment between links and attributes under different strategies of using the historical network data. We also demonstrate the effect of attribute drift, that is, the importance of individual attributes in forming links change over time.},

abstract = {Mining discrete patterns in binary data is important for subsampling, compression, and clustering. We consider rank-one binary matrix approximations that identify the dominant patterns of the data, while preserving its discrete property. A best approximation on such data has a minimum set of inconsistent entries, i.e., mismatches between the given binary data and the approximate matrix. Due to the hardness of the problem, previous accounts of such problems employ heuristics and the resulting approximation may be far away from the optimal one. In this paper, we show that the rank-one binary matrix approximation can be reformulated as a 0-1 integer linear program (ILP). However, the ILP formulation is computationally expensive even for small-size matrices. We propose a linear program (LP) relaxation, which is shown to achieve a guaranteed approximation error bound. We further extend the proposed formulations using the regularization technique, which is commonly employed to address overfitting. The LP formulation is restricted to medium-size matrices, due to the large number of variables involved for large matrices. Interestingly, we show that the proposed approximate formulation can be transformed into an instance of the minimum s-t cut problem, which can be solved efficiently by finding maximum flows. Our empirical study shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm based on the maximum flow. Results also confirm the established theoretical bounds.},

abstract = {Anomalous windows are the contiguous groupings of data points. In this paper, we propose an approach for discovering anomalous windows using Scan Statistics for Linear Intersecting Paths (SSLIP). A linear path refers to a path represented by a line with a single dimensional spatial coordinate marking an observation point. Our approach for discovering anomalous windows along linear paths comprises of the following distinct steps: (a) Cross Path Discovery: where we identify a subset of intersecting paths to be considered, (b) Anomalous Window Discovery: where we outline three order invariant algorithms, namely SSLIP, Brute Force-SSLIP and Central Brute Force-SSLIP, for the traversal of the cross paths to identify varying size directional windows along the paths. For identifying an anomalous window we compute an unusualness metric, in the form of a likelihood ratio to indicate the degree of unusualness of this window with respect to the rest of the data. We identify the window with the highest likelihood ratio as our anomalous window, and (c) Monte Carlo Simulations: to ascertain whether this window is truly anomalous and not just a random occurrence we perform hypothesis testing by computing a p-value using Monte Carlo Simulations. We present extensive experimental results in real world accident datasets for various highways with known issues(code and data available from [27], [21]). Our results show that our approach indeed is effective in identifying anomalous traffic accident windows along multiple intersecting highways.},

abstract = {Online forums represent one type of social media that is particularly rich for studying human behavior in information seeking and diffusing. The way users join communities is a reflection of the changing and expanding of their interests toward information. In this paper, we study the patterns of user participation behavior, and the feature factors that influence such behavior on different forum datasets. We find that, despite the relative randomness and lesser commitment of structural relationships in online forums, users' community joining behaviors display some strong regularities. One particularly interesting observation is that the very weak relationships between users defined by online replies have similar diffusion curves as those of real friendships or co-authorships. We build social selection models, Bipartite Markov Random Field (BiMRF), to quantitatively evaluate the prediction performance of those feature factors and their relationships. Using these models, we show that some features carry supplementary information, and the effectiveness of different features vary in different types of forums. Moreover, the results of BiMRF with two-star configurations suggest that the feature of user similarity defined by frequency of communication or number of common friends is inadequate to predict grouping behavior, but adding node-level features can improve the fit of the model.},

abstract = {Time series prediction is an important issue in a wide range of areas. There are various real world processes whose states vary continuously, and those processes may have influences on each other. If the past information of one process X improves the predictability of another process Y, X is said to have a causal influence on Y. In order to make good predictions, it is necessary to identify the appropriate causal relationships. In addition, the processes to be modeled may include symbolic data as well as numerical data. Therefore, it is important to deal with symbolic and numerical time series seamlessly when attempting to detect causality.In this paper, we propose a new method for quantifying the strength of the causal influence from one time series to another. The proposed method can represent the strength of causality as the number of bits, whether each of two time series is symbolic or numerical. The proposed method can quantify causality even from a small number of samples. In addition, we propose structuring and modeling methods for multivariate time series using causal relationships of two time series. Our structuring and modeling methods can also deal with data sets which include both types of time series. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can perform well even if the number of samples is small.},

abstract = {A heterogeneous information network is an information networkcomposed of multiple types of objects. Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding of both hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in each cluster. However, although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied over decades, clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently.A recent study proposed a new algorithm, RankClus, for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneous networks. However, a real-world network may consist of more than two types, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that a network carries. In this paper, we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networks with a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm, NetClus, that utilizes links across multityped objects to generate high-quality net-clusters. An iterative enhancement method is developed that leads to effective ranking-based clustering in such heterogeneous networks. Our experiments on DBLP data show that NetClus generates more accurate clustering results than the baseline topic model algorithm PLSA and the recently proposed algorithm, RankClus. Further, NetClus generates informative clusters, presenting good ranking and cluster membership information for each attribute object in each net-cluster.},

How to quantify the strength of those social influences? How to estimate the model on real large networks?To address these fundamental questions, we propose Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) to model the topic-level social influence on large networks. In particular, TAP can take results of any topic modeling and the existing network structure to perform topic-level influence propagation.

We further present the common characteristics of distributed learning algorithms for Map-Reduce. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TAP on real large data sets.},

abstract = {Social media such as blogs, Facebook, Flickr, etc., presents data in a network format rather than classical IID distribution. To address the interdependency among data instances, relational learning has been proposed, and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction. However, connections in social media are often multi-dimensional. An actor can connect to another actor for different reasons, e.g., alumni, colleagues, living in the same city, sharing similar interests, etc. Collective inference normally does not differentiate these connections. In this work, we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information, and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning. These social dimensions describe diverse affiliations of actors hidden in the network, and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which affiliations are better aligned with the class labels. Such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network. We conduct extensive experiments on social media data (one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site). Our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference, especially when few labeled data are available. The sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined.},

abstract = {We propose two approximation algorithms for identifying communities in dynamic social networks. Communities are intuitively characterized as "unusually densely knit" subsets of a social network. This notion becomes more problematic if the social interactions change over time. Aggregating social networks over time can radically misrepresent the existing and changing community structure. Recently, we have proposed an optimization-based framework for modeling dynamic community structure. Also, we have proposed an algorithm for finding such structure based on maximum weight bipartite matching. In this paper, we analyze its performance guarantee for a special case where all actors can be observed at all times. In such instances, we show that the algorithm is a small constant factor approximation of the optimum. We use a similar idea to design an approximation algorithm for the general case where some individuals are possibly unobserved at times, and to show that the approximation factor increases twofold but remains a constant regardless of the input size. This is the first algorithm for inferring communities in dynamic networks with a provable approximation guarantee. We demonstrate the general algorithm on real data sets. The results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in identifying dynamic communities.},

We propose a practical method, out of which all triangle counting algorithms can potentially benefit. Using a straightforward triangle counting algorithm as a black box, we performed 166 experiments on real-world networks and on synthetic datasets as well, where we show that our method works with high accuracy, typically more than 99% and gives significant speedups, resulting in even ≈ 130 times faster performance.},

abstract = {Many applications in surveillance, monitoring, scientific discovery, and data cleaning require the identification of anomalies. Although many methods have been developed to identify statistically significant anomalies, a more difficult task is to identify anomalies that are both interesting and statistically significant. Category detection is an emerging area of machine learning that can help address this issue using a "human-in-the-loop" approach. In this interactive setting, the algorithm asks the user to label a query data point under an existing category or declare the query data point to belong to a previously undiscovered category. The goal of category detection is to bring to the user's attention a representative data point from each category in the data in as few queries as possible. In a data set with imbalanced categories, the main challenge is in identifying the rare categories or anomalies; hence, the task is often referred to as rare category detection. We present a new approach to rare category detection based on hierarchical mean shift. In our approach, a hierarchy is created by repeatedly applying mean shift with an increasing bandwidth on the data. This hierarchy allows us to identify anomalies in the data set at different scales, which are then posed as queries to the user. The main advantage of this methodology over existing approaches is that it does not require any knowledge of the dataset properties such as the total number of categories or the prior probabilities of the categories. Results on real-world data sets show that our hierarchical mean shift approach performs consistently better than previous techniques.},

A broad latent query aspect is a set of keywords that succinctly represents one particular sense, or one particular information need, that can aid users in reformulating such queries. We extract such broad latent aspects from query reformulations found in historical search session logs. We propose a framework under which the problem of extracting such broad latent aspects reduces to that of optimizing a formal objective function under constraints on the total number of aspects the system can store, and the number of aspects that can be shown in response to any given query. We present algorithms to find a good set of aspects, and also to pick the best k aspects matching any query. Empirical results on real-world search engine logs show significant gains over a strong baseline that uses single-keyword reformulations: a gain of 14% and 23% in terms of human-judged accuracy and click-through data respectively, and around 20% in terms of consistency among aspects predicted for "similar" queries. This demonstrates both the importance of broad query aspects, and the efficacy of our algorithms for extracting them.},

While many validation measures have been developed for evaluating the performance of clustering algorithms, these measures often provide inconsistent information about the clustering performance and the best suitable measures to use in practice remain unknown. This paper thus fills this crucial void by giving an organized study of 16 external validation measures for K-means clustering. Specifically, we first introduce the importance of measure normalization in the evaluation of the clustering performance on data with imbalanced class distributions. We also provide normalization solutions for several measures. In addition, we summarize the major properties of these external measures. These properties can serve as the guidance for the selection of validation measures in different application scenarios. Finally, we reveal the interrelationships among these external measures. By mathematical transformation, we show that some validation measures are equivalent. Also, some measures have consistent validation performances. Most importantly, we provide a guide line to select the most suitable validation measures for K-means clustering.},

We design and evaluate a number of methods for coping with this problem and compare the performance of these methods. Our quantification-based methods estimate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from the changed distribution and adjust the original classifier accordingly, while our semi-supervised methods build a new classifier using the examples from the new (unlabeled) distribution which are supplemented with predicted class values. We also introduce a hybrid method that utilizes both quantification and semi-supervised learning. All methods are evaluated using accuracy and F-measure on a set of benchmark data sets.

This framework is based on a theoretical analysis that provides a statistical characterization of the effect of local distortion on the mis-clustering rate. We develop two concrete instances of our general framework, one based on local k-means clustering (KASP) and one based on random projection trees (RASP). Extensive experiments show that these algorithms can achieve significant speedups with little degradation in clustering accuracy. Specifically, our algorithms outperform k-means by a large margin in terms of accuracy, and run several times faster than approximate spectral clustering based on the Nystrom method, with comparable accuracy and significantly smaller memory footprint. Remarkably, our algorithms make it possible for a single machine to spectral cluster data sets with a million observations within several minutes.},

abstract = {Labeling text data is quite time-consuming but essential for automatic text classification. Especially, manually creating multiple labels for each document may become impractical when a very large amount of data is needed for training multi-label text classifiers. To minimize the human-labeling efforts, we propose a novel multi-label active learning approach which can reduce the required labeled data without sacrificing the classification accuracy. Traditional active learning algorithms can only handle single-label problems, that is, each data is restricted to have one label. Our approach takes into account the multi-label information, and select the unlabeled data which can lead to the largest reduction of the expected model loss. Specifically, the model loss is approximated by the size of version space, and the reduction rate of the size of version space is optimized with Support Vector Machines (SVM). An effective label prediction method is designed to predict possible labels for each unlabeled data point, and the expected loss for multi-label data is approximated by summing up losses on all labels according to the most confident result of label prediction. Experiments on several real-world data sets (all are publicly available) demonstrate that our approach can obtain promising classification result with much fewer labeled data than state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of combining link and content analysis for community detection from networked data, such as paper citation networks and Word Wide Web. Most existing approaches combine link and content information by a generative model that generates both links and contents via a shared set of community memberships. These generative models have some shortcomings in that they failed to consider additional factors that could affect the community memberships and isolate the contents that are irrelevant to community memberships. To explicitly address these shortcomings, we propose a discriminative model for combining the link and content analysis for community detection. First, we propose a conditional model for link analysis and in the model, we introduce hidden variables to explicitly model the popularity of nodes. Second, to alleviate the impact of irrelevant content attributes, we develop a discriminative model for content analysis. These two models are unified seamlessly via the community memberships. We present efficient algorithms to solve the related optimization problems based on bound optimization and alternating projection. Extensive experiments with benchmark data sets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for combining link and content analysis for community detection.},

abstract = {Topic models provide a powerful tool for analyzing large text collections by representing high dimensional data in a low dimensional subspace. Fitting a topic model given a set of training documents requires approximate inference techniques that are computationally expensive. With today's large-scale, constantly expanding document collections, it is useful to be able to infer topic distributions for new documents without retraining the model. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the performance of several methods for topic inference in previously unseen documents, including methods based on Gibbs sampling, variational inference, and a new method inspired by text classification. The classification-based inference method produces results similar to iterative inference methods, but requires only a single matrix multiplication. In addition to these inference methods, we present SparseLDA, an algorithm and data structure for evaluating Gibbs sampling distributions. Empirical results indicate that SparseLDA can be approximately 20 times faster than traditional LDA and provide twice the speedup of previously published fast sampling methods, while also using substantially less memory.},

abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. Recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems. While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data.In this work we introduce a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations. Informally, shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. As we shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains, algorithms based on the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable, more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art classifiers.},

abstract = {This paper studies web object classification problem with the novel exploration of social tags. Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental preprocess for indexing, browsing, searching, and mining these objects. The explosive growth of heterogeneous web objects, especially non-textual objects such as products, pictures, and videos, has made the problem of web classification increasingly challenging. Such objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable features with semantic information, interconnections between each other, as well as training examples with category labels.In this paper, we explore the social tagging data to bridge this gap. We cast web object classification problem as an optimization problem on a graph of objects and tags. We then propose an efficient algorithm which not only utilizes social tags as enriched semantic features for the objects, but also infers the categories of unlabeled objects from both homogeneous and heterogeneous labeled objects, through the implicit connection of social tags. Experiment results show that the exploration of social tags effectively boosts web object classification. Our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art of general classification methods.},

abstract = {Email is one of the most prevalent communication tools today, and solving the email overload problem is pressingly urgent. A good way to alleviate email overload is to automatically prioritize received messages according to the priorities of each user. However, research on statistical learning methods for fully personalized email prioritization (PEP) has been sparse due to privacy issues, since people are reluctant to share personal messages and importance judgments with the research community. It is therefore important to develop and evaluate PEP methods under the assumption that only limited training examples can be available, and that the system can only have the personal email data of each user during the training and testing of the model for that user. This paper presents the first study (to the best of our knowledge) under such an assumption. Specifically, we focus on analysis of personal social networks to capture user groups and to obtain rich features that represent the social roles from the viewpoint of a particular user. We also developed a novel semi-supervised (transductive) learning algorithm that propagates importance labels from training examples to test examples through message and user nodes in a personal email network. These methods together enable us to obtain an enriched vector representation of each new email message, which consists of both standard features of an email message (such as words in the title or body, sender and receiver IDs, etc.) and the induced social features from the sender and receivers of the message. Using the enriched vector representation as the input in SVM classifiers to predict the importance level for each test message, we obtained significant performance improvement over the baseline system (without induced social features) in our experiments on a multi-user data collection. We obtained significant performance improvement over the baseline system (without induced social features) in our experiments on a multi-user data collection: the relative error reduction in MAE was 31% in micro-averaging, and 14% in macro-averaging.},

abstract = {Our dynamic graph-based relational mining approach has been developed to learn structural patterns in biological networks as they change over time. The analysis of dynamic networks is important not only to understand life at the system-level, but also to discover novel patterns in other structural data. Most current graph-based data mining approaches overlook dynamic features of biological networks, because they are focused on only static graphs. Our approach analyzes a sequence of graphs and discovers rules that capture the changes that occur between pairs of graphs in the sequence. These rules represent the graph rewrite rules that the first graph must go through to be isomorphic to the second graph. Then, our approach feeds the graph rewrite rules into a machine learning system that learns general transformation rules describing the types of changes that occur for a class of dynamic biological networks. The discovered graph-rewriting rules show how biological networks change over time, and the transformation rules show the repeated patterns in the structural changes. In this paper, we apply our approach to biological networks to evaluate our approach and to understand how the biosystems change over time. We evaluate our results using coverage and prediction metrics, and compare to biological literature.},

In this paper, we propose a novel community detection algorithm, which utilizes a dynamic process by contradicting the network topology and the topology-based propinquity, where the propinquity is a measure of the probability for a pair of nodes involved in a coherent community structure. Through several rounds of mutual reinforcement between topology and propinquity, the community structures are expected to naturally emerge. The overlapping vertices shared between communities can also be easily identified by an additional simple postprocessing. To achieve better efficiency, the propinquity is incrementally calculated. We implement the algorithm on a vertex-oriented bulk synchronous parallel(BSP) model so that the mining load can be distributed on thousands of machines. We obtained interesting experimental results on several real network data.},

However, the assumption made by existing approaches, that the marginal and conditional probabilities are directly related between source and target domains, has limited applicability in either the original space or its linear transformations. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive kernel approach that maps the marginal distribution of target-domain and source-domain data into a common kernel space, and utilize a sample selection strategy to draw conditional probabilities between the two domains closer. We formally show that under the kernel-mapping space, the difference in distributions between the two domains is bounded; and the prediction error of the proposed approach can also be bounded. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both traditional inductive classifiers and the state-of-the-art boosting-based transfer algorithms on most domains, including text categorization and web page ratings. In particular, it can achieve around 10% higher accuracy than other approaches for the text categorization problem. The source code and datasets are available from the authors.},

However, the existing M3N formulation does not enjoy primal sparsity, which is a desirable property for selecting significant features and reducing the risk of over-fitting. In this paper, we present an l1-norm regularized max-margin Markov network (l1-M3N), which enjoys dual and primal sparsity simultaneously. To learn an l1-M3N, we present three methods including projected sub-gradient, cutting-plane, and a novel EM-style algorithm, which is based on an equivalence between l1-M3N and an adaptive M3N. We perform extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real data sets. Our experimental results show that: (1) l1-M3N can effectively select significant features; (2) l1-M3N can perform as well as the pseudo-primal sparse Laplace M3N in prediction accuracy, while consistently outperforms other competing methods that enjoy either primal or dual sparsity; and (3) the EM-algorithm is more robust than the other two in pre-diction accuracy and time efficiency.},

abstract = {Implicit user feedback, including click-through and subsequent browsing behavior, is crucial for evaluating and improving the quality of results returned by search engines. Several recent studies [1, 2, 3, 13, 25] have used post-result browsing behavior including the sites visited, the number of clicks, and the dwell time on site in order to improve the ranking of search results. In this paper, we first study user behavior on sponsored search results (i.e., the advertisements displayed by search engines next to the organic results), and compare this behavior to that of organic results. Second, to exploit post-result user behavior for better ranking of sponsored results, we focus on identifying patterns in user behavior and predict expected on-site actions in future instances. In particular, we show how post-result behavior depends on various properties of the queries, advertisement, sites, and users, and build a classifier using properties such as these to predict certain aspects of the user behavior. Additionally, we develop a generative model to mimic trends in observed user activity using a mixture of pareto distributions. We conduct experiments based on billions of real navigation trails collected by a major search engine's browser toolbar.},

abstract = {Data analytics tools and frameworks abound, yet rapid deployment of analytics solutions that deliver actionable insights from business data remains a challenge. The primary reason is that on-field practitioners are required to be both technically proficient and knowledgeable about the business. The recent abundance of unstructured business data has thrown up new opportunities for analytics, but has also multiplied the deployment challenge, since interpretation of concepts derived from textual sources require a deep understanding of the business. In such a scenario, a managed service for analytics comes up as the best alternative. A managed analytics service is centered around a business analyst who acts as a liaison between the business and the technology. This calls for new tools that assist the analyst to be efficient in the tasks that she needs to execute. Also, the analytics needs to be repeatable, in that the delivered insights should not depend heavily on the expertise of specific analysts. These factors lead us to identify new areas that open up for KDD research in terms of 'time-to-insight' and repeatability for these analysts. We present our analytics framework in the form of a managed service offering for CRM analytics. We describe different analyst-centric tools using a case study from real-life engagements and demonstrate their effectiveness.},

abstract = {For implementing content management solutions and enabling new applications associated with data retention, regulatory compliance, and litigation issues, enterprises need to develop advanced analytics to uncover relationships among the documents, e.g., content similarity, provenance, and clustering. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of four syntactic similarity algorithms. Three algorithms are based on Broder's "shingling" technique while the fourth algorithm employs a more recent approach, "content-based chunking". For our experiments, we use a specially designed corpus of documents that includes a set of "similar" documents with a controlled number of modifications. Our performance study reveals that the similarity metric of all four algorithms is highly sensitive to settings of the algorithms' parameters: sliding window size and fingerprint sampling frequency. We identify a useful range of these parameters for achieving good practical results, and compare the performance of the four algorithms in a controlled environment. We validate our results by applying these algorithms to finding near-duplicates in two large collections of HP technical support documents.},

abstract = {Conjoint analysis is one of the most popular market research methodologies for assessing how customers with heterogeneous preferences appraise various objective characteristics in products or services, which provides critical inputs for many marketing decisions, e.g. optimal design of new products and target market selection. Nowadays it becomes practical in e-commercial applications to collect millions of samples quickly. However, the large-scale data sets make traditional conjoint analysis coupled with sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation for parameter estimation computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we report a successful large-scale case study of conjoint analysis on click through stream in a real-world application at Yahoo!. We consider identifying users' heterogenous preferences from millions of click/view events and building predictive models to classify new users into segments of distinct behavior pattern. A scalable conjoint analysis technique, known as tensor segmentation, is developed by utilizing logistic tensor regression in standard partworth framework for solutions. In offline analysis on the samples collected from a random bucket of Yahoo! Front Page Today Module, we compare tensor segmentation against other segmentation schemes using demographic information, and study user preferences on article content within tensor segments. Our knowledge acquired in the segmentation results also provides assistance to editors in content management and user targeting. The usefulness of our approach is further verified by the observations in a bucket test launched in Dec. 2008.},

While the theoretical aspects of offline controlled experiments have been well studied and documented, the practical aspects of running them in online settings, such as web sites and services, are still being developed. As the usage of controlled experiments grows in these online settings, it is becoming more important to understand the opportunities and pitfalls one might face when using them in practice. A survey of online controlled experiments and lessons learned were previously documented in Controlled Experiments on the Web: Survey and Practical Guide (Kohavi, et al., 2009). In this follow-on paper, we focus on pitfalls we have seen after running numerous experiments at Microsoft. The pitfalls include a wide range of topics, such as assuming that common statistical formulas used to calculate standard deviation and statistical power can be applied and ignoring robots in analysis (a problem unique to online settings). Online experiments allow for techniques like gradual ramp-up of treatments to avoid the possibility of exposing many customers to a bad (e.g., buggy) Treatment. With that ability, we discovered that it's easy to incorrectly identify the winning Treatment because of Simpson's paradox.},

abstract = {All Netflix Prize algorithms proposed so far are prohibitively costly for large-scale production systems. In this paper, we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering (CF) solution to the Netflix Prize problem [1] based on weighted coclustering [5]. The dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware, while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing, threading, memory management, and deadlocks.The dataflow CF implementation first compresses the large, sparse training dataset into co-clusters. Then it generates recommendations by combining the average ratings of the co-clusters with the biases of the users and movies. When configured to identify 20x20 co-clusters in the Netflix training dataset, the implementation predicted over 100 million ratings in 16.31 minutes and achieved an RMSE of 0.88846 without any fine-tuning or domain knowledge. This is an effective real-time prediction runtime of 9.7 us per rating which is far superior to previously reported results. Moreover, the implemented co-clustering framework supports a wide variety of other large-scale data mining applications and forms the basis for predictive modeling on large, dyadic datasets [4, 7].},

abstract = {Opinion mining became an important topic of study in recent years due to its wide range of applications. There are also many companies offering opinion mining services. One problem that has not been studied so far is the assignment of entities that have been talked about in each sentence. Let us use forum discussions about products as an example to make the problem concrete. In a typical discussion post, the author may give opinions on multiple products and also compare them. The issue is how to detect what products have been talked about in each sentence. If the sentence contains the product names, they need to be identified. We call this problem entity discovery. If the product names are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence but are implied due to the use of pronouns and language conventions, we need to infer the products. We call this problem entity assignment. These problems are important because without knowing what products each sentence talks about the opinion mined from the sentence is of little use. In this paper, we study these problems and propose two effective methods to solve the problems. Entity discovery is based on pattern discovery and entity assignment is based on mining of comparative sentences. Experimental results using a large number of forum posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique. Our system has also been successfully tested in a commercial setting.},

abstract = {A recent study by two prominent finance researchers, Fama and French, introduces a new framework for studying risk vs. return: the migration of stocks across size-value portfolio space. Given the financial events of 2008, this first attempt to disentangle the relationships between migration behavior and stock returns is especially timely. Their work, however, derives results only for market segments, not individual companies, and only for one-year moves. Thus, we see a new challenge for financial data mining: how to capture and categorize the migration of individual companies, and how such behavior affects their returns.We propose a novel data mining approach to study the multi-year movement of individual companies. Specifically, we address the question: "How does one discover frequent migration patterns in the stock market?" We present a new trajectory mining algorithm to discover migration motifs in financial markets. Novel features of this algorithm are its handling of approximate pattern matching through a graph theoretical method, maximal clique identification, and incorporation of temporal and spatial constraints. We have performed a detailed study of the NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX stock markets, over a 43-year span. We successfully find migration motifs that confirm existing finance theories and other motifs that may lead to new financial models.},

abstract = {Classification is a core task in knowledge discovery and data mining, and there has been substantial research effort in developing sophisticated classification models. In a parallel thread, recent work from the NLP community suggests that for tasks such as natural language disambiguation even a simple algorithm can outperform a sophisticated one, if it is provided with large quantities of high quality training data. In those applications, training data occurs naturally in text corpora, and high quality training data sets running into billions of words have been reportedly used.We explore how we can apply the lessons from the NLP community to KDD tasks. Specifically, we investigate how to identify data sources that can yield training data at low cost and study whether the quantity of the automatically extracted training data can compensate for its lower quality. We carry out this investigation for the specific task of inferring whether a search query has commercial intent. We mine toolbar and click logs to extract queries from sites that are predominantly commercial (e.g., Amazon) and non-commercial (e.g., Wikipedia). We compare the accuracy obtained using such training data against manually labeled training data. Our results show that we can have large accuracy gains using automatically extracted training data at much lower cost.},

abstract = {Address standardization is a very challenging task in data cleansing. To provide better customer relationship management and business intelligence for customer-oriented cooperates, millions of free-text addresses need to be converted to a standard format for data integration, de-duplication and householding. Existing commercial tools usually employ lots of hand-craft, domain-specific rules and reference data dictionary of cities, states etc. These rules work better for the region they are designed. However, rule-based methods usually require more human efforts to rewrite these rules for each new domain since address data are very irregular and varied with countries and regions. Supervised learning methods usually are more adaptable than rule-based approaches. However, supervised methods need large-scale labeled training data. It is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task to build a large-scale annotated corpus for each target domain. For minimizing human efforts and the size of labeled training data set, we present a free-text address standardization method with latent semantic association (LaSA). LaSA model is constructed to capture latent semantic association among words from the unlabeled corpus. The original term space of the target domain is projected to a concept space using LaSA model at first, then the address standardization model is active learned from LaSA features and informative samples. The proposed method effectively captures the data distribution of the domain. Experimental results on large-scale English and Chinese corpus show that the proposed method significantly enhances the performance of standardization with less efforts and training data.},

Experimental results obtained from (1) historical logs and (2) live trials on a large-scale advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the overall success of our approach in identifying high-quality broad match mappings.},

abstract = {In recent years, the number of patents filed by the business enterprises in the technology industry are growing rapidly, thus providing unprecedented opportunities for knowledge discovery in patent data. One important task in this regard is to employ data mining techniques to rank patents in terms of their potential to earn money through licensing. Availability of such ranking can substantially reduce enterprise IP (Intellectual Property) management costs. Unfortunately, the existing software systems in the IP domain do not address this task directly. Through our research, we build a patent ranking software, named COA (Claim Originality Analysis) that rates a patent based on its value by measuring the recency and the impact of the important phrases that appear in the "claims" section of a patent. Experiments show that COA produces meaningful ranking when comparing it with other indirect patent evaluation metrics--citation count, patent status, and attorney's rating. In reallife settings, this tool was used by beta-testers in the IBM IP department. Lawyers found it very useful in patent rating, specifically, in highlighting potentially valuable patents in a patent cluster. In this article, we describe the ranking techniques and system architecture of COA. We also present the results that validate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of unsupervised network anomaly detection. In recent years, networks have played more and more critical roles. Since their outages cause serious economic losses, it is quite significant to monitor their changes over time and to detect anomalies as early as possible. In this paper, we specifically focus on the management of the whole network. In it, it is important to detect anomalies which make great impact on the whole network, and the other local anomalies should be ignored. Further, when we detect the former anomalies, it is required to localize nodes responsible for them. It is challenging to simultaneously perform the above two tasks taking into account the nonstationarity and strong correlations between nodes.We propose a network anomaly detection method which resolves the above two tasks in a unified way. The key ideas of the method are: (1)construction of quantities representing feature of a whole network and each node from the same input based on eigen equation compression, and (2)incremental anomalousness scoring based on learning the probability distribution of the quantities.We demonstrate through the experimental results using two benchmark data sets and a simulation data set that anomalies of a whole network and nodes responsible for them can be detected by the proposed method.},

abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to share their opinions and hands-on experiences on products they have purchased. Unfortunately, reading through all customer reviews is difficult, especially for popular items, the number of reviews can be up to hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision. The OpinionMiner system designed in this work aims to mine customer reviews of a product and extract high detailed product entities on which reviewers express their opinions. Opinion expressions are identified and opinion orientations for each recognized product entity are classified as positive or negative. Different from previous approaches that employed rule-based or statistical techniques, we propose a novel machine learning approach built under the framework of lexicalized HMMs. The approach naturally integrates multiple important linguistic features into automatic learning. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main components of the system. The evaluation of the proposed method is presented based on processing the online product reviews from Amazon and other publicly available datasets.},

However, little work has been done on organizing the query results for object-level search. Object-level search result clustering is challenging because we need to support diverse similarity notions over object-specific features (such as the price and weight of a product) of heterogeneous domains. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid subspace clustering algorithm called Hydra. Algorithm Hydra captures the user perception of diverse similarity notions from millions of Web pages and disambiguates different senses using feature-based subspace locality measures. Our proposed solution, by combining wisdom of crowds and wisdom of data, achieves robustness and efficiency over existing approaches. We extensively evaluate our proposed framework and demonstrate how to enrich user experiences in object-level search using a real-world product search scenarios.},

While recommender systems have been widely studied, this is mostly in relation to leisure products (e.g. movies, books and music) with non-repeated purchases. In grocery shopping, however, consumers will make multiple purchases of the same or very similar products more frequently than buying entirely new items. The proposed recommendation scheme offers several advantages in addressing the grocery shopping problem, namely: 1) a product similarity measure that suits a domain where no rating information is available; 2) a basket sensitive random walk model to approximate product similarities by exploiting incomplete neighborhood information; 3) online adaptation of the recommendation based on the current basket and 4) a new performance measure focusing on products that customers have not purchased before or purchase infrequently. Empirical results benchmarking on three real-world data sets demonstrate a performance improvement of the proposed method over other existing collaborative filtering models.},

abstract = {Learning temporal graph structures from time series data reveals important dependency relationships between current observations and histories. Most previous work focuses on learning and predicting with "static" temporal graphs only. However, in many applications such as mechanical systems and biology systems, the temporal dependencies might change over time. In this paper, we develop a dynamic temporal graphical models based on hidden Markov model regression and lasso-type algorithms. Our method is able to integrate two usually separate tasks, i.e. inferring underlying states and learning temporal graphs, in one unified model. The output temporal graphs provide better understanding about complex systems, i.e. how their dependency graphs evolve over time, and achieve more accurate predictions. We examine our model on two synthetic datasets as well as a real application dataset for monitoring oil-production equipment to capture different stages of the system, and achieve promising results.},

abstract = {Web content analysis often has two sequential and separate steps: Web Classification to identify the target Web pages, and Web Information Extraction to extract the metadata contained in the target Web pages. This decoupled strategy is highly ineffective since the errors in Web classification will be propagated to Web information extraction and eventually accumulate to a high level. In this paper we study the mutual dependencies between these two steps and propose to combine them by using a model of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This model can be used to simultaneously recognize the target Web pages and extract the corresponding metadata. Systematic experiments in our project OfCourse for online course search show that this model significantly improves the F1 value for both of the two steps. We believe that our model can be easily generalized to many Web applications.},

abstract = {The importance of event logs, as a source of information in systems and network management cannot be overemphasized. With the ever increasing size and complexity of today's event logs, the task of analyzing event logs has become cumbersome to carry out manually. For this reason recent research has focused on the automatic analysis of these log files. In this paper we present IPLoM (Iterative Partitioning Log Mining), a novel algorithm for the mining of clusters from event logs. Through a 3-Step hierarchical partitioning process IPLoM partitions log data into its respective clusters. In its 4th and final stage IPLoM produces cluster descriptions or line formats for each of the clusters produced. Unlike other similar algorithms IPLoM is not based on the Apriori algorithm and it is able to find clusters in data whether or not its instances appear frequently. Evaluations show that IPLoM outperforms the other algorithms statistically significantly, and it is also able to achieve an average F-Measure performance 78% when the closest other algorithm achieves an F-Measure performance of 10%.},

abstract = {Classifying nodes in networks is a task with a wide range of applications. It can be particularly useful in anomaly and fraud detection. Many resources are invested in the task of fraud detection due to the high cost of fraud, and being able to automatically detect potential fraud quickly and precisely allows human investigators to work more efficiently. Many data analytic schemes have been put into use; however, schemes that bolster link analysis prove promising. This work builds upon the belief propagation algorithm for use in detecting collusion and other fraud schemes. We propose an algorithm called SNARE (Social Network Analysis for Risk Evaluation). By allowing one to use domain knowledge as well as link knowledge, the method was very successful for pinpointing misstated accounts in our sample of general ledger data, with a significant improvement over the default heuristic in true positive rates, and a lift factor of up to 6.5 (more than twice that of the default heuristic). We also apply SNARE to the task of graph labeling in general on publicly-available datasets. We show that with only some information about the nodes themselves in a network, we get surprisingly high accuracy of labels. Not only is SNARE applicable in a wide variety of domains, but it is also robust to the choice of parameters and highly scalable-linearly with the number of edges in a graph.},

abstract = {The explosion of user-generated content on the Web has led to new opportunities and significant challenges for companies, that are increasingly concerned about monitoring the discussion around their products. Tracking such discussion on weblogs, provides useful insight on how to improve products or market them more effectively. An important component of such analysis is to characterize the sentiment expressed in blogs about specific brands and products. Sentiment Analysis focuses on this task of automatically identifying whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative opinion about the subject matter. Most previous work in this area uses prior lexical knowledge in terms of the sentiment-polarity of words. In contrast, some recent approaches treat the task as a text classification problem, where they learn to classify sentiment based only on labeled training data. In this paper, we present a unified framework in which one can use background lexical information in terms of word-class associations, and refine this information for specific domains using any available training examples. Empirical results on diverse domains show that our approach performs better than using background knowledge or training data in isolation, as well as alternative approaches to using lexical knowledge with text classification.},

abstract = {There is a growing number of service providers that a consumer can interact with over the web to learn their service terms. The service terms, such as price and time to completion of the service, depend on the consumer's particular specifications. For instance, a printing services provider would need from its customers specifications such as the size of paper, type of ink, proofing and perforation. In a few sectors, there exist marketplace sites that provide consumers with specifications forms, which the consumer can fill out to learn the service terms of multiple service providers. Unfortunately, there are only a few such marketplace sites, and they cover a few sectors.At HP Labs, we are working towards building a universal marketplace site, i.e., a marketplace site that covers thousands of sectors and hundreds of providers per sector. One issue in this domain is the automated discovery/retrieval of the specifications for each sector. We address it through extracting and analyzing content from the websites of the service providers listed in business directories. The challenge is that each service provider is often listed under multiple service categories in a business directory, making it infeasible to utilize standard supervised learning techniques. We address this challenge through employing a multilabel statistical clustering approach within an expectation-maximization framework. We implement our solution to retrieve specifications for 3000 sectors, representing more than 300,000 service providers. We discuss our results within the context of the services needed to design a marketing campaign for a small business.},

abstract = {Motivation: Data centers are a critical component of modern IT infrastructure but are also among the worst environmental offenders through their increasing energy usage and the resulting large carbon footprints. Efficient management of data centers, including power management, networking, and cooling infrastructure, is hence crucial to sustainability. In the absence of a 'first-principles' approach to manage these complex components and their interactions, data-driven approaches have become attractive and tenable.Results: We present a temporal data mining solution to model and optimize performance of data center chillers, a key component of the cooling infrastructure. It helps bridge raw, numeric, time-series information from sensor streams toward higher level characterizations of chiller behavior, suitable for a data center engineer. To aid in this transduction, temporal data streams are first encoded into a symbolic representation, next run-length encoded segments are mined to form frequent motifs in time series, and finally these metrics are evaluated by their contributions to sustainability. A key innovation in our application is the ability to intersperse "don't care" transitions (e.g., transients) in continuous-valued time series data, an advantage we inherit by the application of frequent episode mining to symbolized representations of numeric time series. Our approach provides both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the sensor streams to the data center engineer, to aid him in tuning chiller operating characteristics. This system is currently being prototyped for a data center managed by HP and experimental results from this application reveal the promise of our approach.},

The bounce rate of an ad can be informally defined as the fraction of users who click on the ad but almost immediately move on to other tasks. A high bounce rate can lead to poor advertiser return on investment, and suggests search engine users may be having a poor experience following the click. In this paper, we first provide quantitative analysis showing that bounce rate is an effective measure of user satisfaction. We then address the question, can we predict bounce rate by analyzing the features of the advertisement? An affirmative answer would allow advertisers and search engines to predict the effectiveness and quality of advertisements before they are shown. We propose solutions to this problem involving large-scale learning methods that leverage features drawn from ad creatives in addition to their keywords and landing pages.},

abstract = {Effective diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia in elderly patients, is of primary importance in biomedical research. Recent studies have demonstrated that AD is closely related to the structure change of the brain network, i.e., the connectivity among different brain regions. The connectivity patterns will provide useful imaging-based biomarkers to distinguish Normal Controls (NC), patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with AD. In this paper, we investigate the sparse inverse covariance estimation technique for identifying the connectivity among different brain regions. In particular, a novel algorithm based on the block coordinate descent approach is proposed for the direct estimation of the inverse covariance matrix. One appealing feature of the proposed algorithm is that it allows the user feedback (e.g., prior domain knowledge) to be incorporated into the estimation process, while the connectivity patterns can be discovered automatically. We apply the proposed algorithm to a collection of FDG-PET images from 232 NC, MCI, and AD subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is promising in revealing the brain region connectivity differences among these groups.},

abstract = {Automatic news extraction from news pages is important in many Web applications such as news aggregation. However, the existing news extraction methods based on template-level wrapper induction have three serious limitations. First, the existing methods cannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template. Second, it is costly to maintain up-to-date wrappers for a large amount of news websites, because any change of a template may invalidate the corresponding wrapper. Last, the existing methods can merely extract unformatted plain texts, and thus are not user friendly. In this paper, we tackle the problem of template-independent Web news extraction in a user-friendly way. We formalize Web news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site. Novel features dedicated to news titles and bodies are developed. Correlations between news titles and news bodies are exploited. Our template-independent wrapper can extract news pages from different sites regardless of templates. Moreover, our approach can extract not only texts, but also images and animates within the news bodies and the extracted news articles are in the same visual style as in the original pages. In our experiments, a wrapper learned from 40 pages from a single news site achieved an accuracy of 98.1% on 3,973 news pages from 12 news sites.},

abstract = {In this article, we report our efforts in mining the information encoded as clickthrough data in the server logs to evaluate and monitor the relevance ranking quality of a commercial web search engine. We describe a metric called pSkip that aims to quantify the ranking quality by estimating the probability of users encountering non relevant results that cost them the efforts to read and skip. A search engine with a lower pSkip is regarded as having a better ranking quality. A key design goal of pSkip is to integrate the findings from two sets of user studies that utilize eye-tracking devices to track users' browsing patterns on the search result pages, and that use specially instrumented browsers to actively solicit users' explicit judgments on their search activities. We present the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimation of pSkip and demonstrate its efficacy in describing the user study data. The mathematical properties of pSkip are further analyzed and compared with several objective metrics as well as the cumulated gain method that uses subjective judgments. Experimental data show that pSkip can measure aspects of the search quality that these existing metrics are not designed or fail to address, such as identifying the real search intents expressed in the ambiguous queries. Although effective and superior in many ways, we also report a series of experiments that show pSkip may be influenced by system issues that are not directly related to relevance ranking, suggesting that measurements complementary to pSkip are still needed in order to form a holistic and accurate characterization of the ranking quality.},

abstract = {This paper addresses Named Entity Mining (NEM), in which we mine knowledge about named entities such as movies, games, and books from a huge amount of data. NEM is potentially useful in many applications including web search, online advertisement, and recommender system. There are three challenges for the task: finding suitable data source, coping with the ambiguities of named entity classes, and incorporating necessary human supervision into the mining process. This paper proposes conducting NEM by using click-through data collected at a web search engine, employing a topic model that generates the click-through data, and learning the topic model by weak supervision from humans. Specifically, it characterizes each named entity by its associated queries and URLs in the click-through data. It uses the topic model to resolve ambiguities of named entity classes by representing the classes as topics. It employs a method, referred to as Weakly Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (WS-LDA), to accurately learn the topic model with partially labeled named entities. Experiments on a large scale click-through data containing over 1.5 billion query-URL pairs show that the proposed approach can conduct very accurate NEM and significantly outperforms the baseline.},

abstract = {We study in this paper the problem of incremental crawling of web forums, which is a very fundamental yet challenging step in many web applications. Traditional approaches mainly focus on scheduling the revisiting strategy of each individual page. However, simply assigning different weights for different individual pages is usually inefficient in crawling forum sites because of the different characteristics between forum sites and general websites. Instead of treating each individual page independently, we propose a list-wise strategy by taking into account the site-level knowledge. Such site-level knowledge is mined through reconstructing the linking structure, called sitemap, for a given forum site. With the sitemap, posts from the same thread but distributed on various pages can be concatenated according to their timestamps. After that, for each thread, we employ a regression model to predict the time when the next post arrives. Based on this model, we develop an efficient crawler which is 260% faster than some state-of-the-art methods in terms of fetching new generated content; and meanwhile our crawler also ensure a high coverage ratio. Experimental results show promising performance of Coverage, Bandwidth utilization, and Timeliness of our crawler on 18 various forums.},

abstract = {Currently, the most significant line of defense against malware is anti-virus products which focus on authenticating valid software from a white list, blocking invalid software from a black list, and running any unknown software (i.e., the gray list) in a controlled manner. The gray list, containing unknown software programs which could be either normal or malicious, is usually authenticated or rejected manually by virus analysts. Unfortunately, along with the development of the malware writing techniques, the number of file samples in the gray list that need to be analyzed by virus analysts on a daily basis is constantly increasing. In this paper, we develop an intelligent file scoring system (IFSS for short) for malware detection from the gray list by an ensemble of heterogeneous base-level classifiers derived by different learning methods, using different feature representations on dynamic training sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of applying such ensemble methods for malware detection. IFSS makes it practical for virus analysts to identify malware samples from the huge gray list and improves the detection ability of anti-virus software. It has already been incorporated into the scanning tool of Kingsoft's Anti-Virus software. The case studies on large and real daily collection of the gray list illustrate that the detection ability and efficiency of our IFSS system outperforms other popular scanning tools such as NOD32 and Kaspersky.},

abstract = {Search logs, which contain rich and up-to-date information about users' needs and preferences, have become a critical data source for search engines. Recently, more and more data-driven applications are being developed in search engines based on search logs, such as query suggestion, keyword bidding, and dissatisfactory query analysis. In this paper, by observing that many data-driven applications in search engines highly rely on online mining of search logs, we develop an OLAP system on search logs which serves as an infrastructure supporting various data-driven applications. An empirical study using real data of over two billion query sessions demonstrates the usefulness and feasibility of our design.},
