abstract = {Data mining has attracted tremendous interest in the research 
community as well as commercial market place. The last few years have witnessed a flurry of technical innovations and introduction of comercial products. The next major challenge facing data mining is to make a transition from a niche technology to a main stream technology. I will present key technical and environmental issues that must be addressed for a successful transition.},

abstract = {The technologies of data warehousing, data mining, hypertext analysis, information visualization, and web information resources are rapidly converging. The challenge is to architect these technologies into a system for systematic business intelligence for a corporation. We need to move from an information refining process that is often haphazard and narrow to one that is reliable and continuous. Web farming is a new area that suggests a methodology and architecture for accomplishing this.},

The plan coincided with the formation of AT&amp;T Labs and the proposed research agenda of the InfoLab, which is both a physical laboratory and an interdisciplinary collection of information researchers in CS, mathematics, and Statistics. At the halfway point of this odyssey we can identify some success stories but more importantly it is an opportune time to re-calibrate the challenges and the milestones.},
