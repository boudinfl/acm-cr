abstract = {Bioinformatics is the study of information flow in biology. Interest in the field has exploded in the last 10 years with the emergence of techniques for large scale experimental data collection-including genome sequencing, gene expression analysis, protein interaction detection, high-throughput structure determination and others. These techniques, in the context of a large online published literature, have created relatively large data sets (at least by biological standards) that are not possible to analyze manually. There is therefore a critical need for methods to analyze these data and reduce them to new knowledge. The principle challenges to the field include the great diversity of data types and questions that are asked of the data, and the communication difficulties that can exist between experts in biology and experts in machine learning. In this talk, I will provide an introduction to the major biological questions that are being addressed, why they are important, and how the field is trying to address them with technical approaches.},

Nowadays, it has become possible to model millions of events described by thousands of variables, within a reasonable time for a specific application. The SRM approach works with a family of models and calibrates the family of models to a point which is the best compromise between accuracy and robustness. It also measures the complexity of the model using VC dimension which is not plagued by number of parameters. Hence models for large events described by several parameters can be generalized. This opens up great prospects in numerous fields like Customer Relationship Management, Network Optimization, Risk Management, Manufacturing Yield Management, and a number of other data-rich problems.},

abstract = {Organizations conducting Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) can greatly benefit from the insight that data mining of transactional and clickstream data provides. Such insight helps not only to improve the electronic channel (e.g., a web site), but it is also a learning vehicle for the bigger organization conducting business at brick-and-mortar stores. The e-commerce site serves as an early alert system for emerging patterns and a laboratory for experimentation. For successful data mining, several ingredients are needed and e-commerce provides all the right ones (the Good). Web server logs, which are commonly used as the source of data for mining e-commerce data, were designed to debug web servers, and the data they provide is insufficient, requiring the use of heuristics to reconstruct events. Moreover, many events are never logged in web server logs, limiting the source of data for mining (the Bad). Many of the problems of dealing with web server log data can be resolved by properly architecting the e-commerce sites to generate data needed for mining. Even with a good architecture, however, there are challenging problems that remain hard to solve (the Ugly). Lessons and metrics based on mining real e-commerce data are presented.},

We present a statistically sound method for estimating the DGX parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We applied DGX to a wide variety of real world data sets, such as sales data from a large retailer chain, us-age data from AT&amp;T, and Internet clickstream data; in all cases, DGX fits these distributions very well, with almost a 99% correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots. Our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data. Finally, we illustrate the power of DGX as a new tool for data mining tasks, such as outlier detection.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the construction of regression and classification trees that are more adapted to data mining applications than conventional trees. To this end, we propose new splitting criteria for growing trees. Conventional splitting criteria attempt to perform well on both sides of a split by attempting a compromise in the quality of fit between the left and the right side. By contrast, we adopt a data mining point of view by proposing criteria that search for interesting subsets of the data, as opposed to modeling all of the data equally well. The new criteria do not split based on a compromise between the left and the right bucket; they effectively pick the more interesting bucket and ignore the other.As expected, the result is often a simpler characterization of interesting subsets of the data. Less expected is that the new criteria often yield whole trees that provide more interpretable data descriptions. Surprisingly, it is a "flaw" that works to their advantage: The new criteria have an increased tendency to accept splits near the boundaries of the predictor ranges. This so-called "end-cut problem" leads to the repeated peeling of small layers of data and results in very unbalanced but highly expressive and interpretable trees.},

Examples include market basket data in retail commerce, telephone call records in telecommunications, and Web logs of individual page-requests at Web sites. Profiling consists of using historical transaction data on individuals to construct a model of each individual's behavior. Simple profiling techniques such as histograms do not generalize well from sparse transaction data. In this paper we investigate the application of probabilistic mixture models to automatically generate profiles from large volumes of transaction data. In effect, the mixture model represents each individual's behavior as a linear combination of "basis transactions." We evaluate several variations of the model on a large retail transaction data set and show that the proposed model provides improved predictive power over simpler histogram-based techniques, as well as being relatively scalable, interpretable, and flexible. In addition we point to applications in outlier detection, customer ranking, interactive visualization, and so forth. The paper concludes by comparing and relating the proposed framework to other transaction-data modeling techniques such as association rules.},

abstract = {The similarity join is an important operation for mining high-dimensional feature spaces. Given two data sets, the similarity join computes all tuples (x, y) that are within a distance Îµ.One of the most efficient algorithms for processing similarity-joins is the Multidimensional-Spatial Join (MSJ) by Koudas and Sevcik. In our previous work --- pursued for the two-dimensional case --- we found however that MSJ has several performance shortcomings in terms of CPU and I/O cost as well as memory-requirements. Therefore, MSJ is not generally applicable to high-dimensional data.In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named Generic External Space Sweep (GESS). GESS introduces a modest rate of data replication to reduce the number of expensive distance computations. We present a new cost-model for replication, an I/O model, and an inexpensive method for duplicate removal. The principal component of our algorithm is a highly flexible replication engine.Our analytical model predicts a tremendous reduction of the number of expensive distance computations by several orders of magnitude in comparison to MSJ (factor 107). In addition, the memory requirements of GESS are shown to be lower by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the I/O cost of our algorithm is by factor 2 better (independent from the fact whether replication occurs or not). Our analytical results are confirmed by a large series of simulations and experiments with synthetic and real high-dimensional data sets.},

abstract = {One of the major applications of data mining is in helping companies determine which potential customers to market to. If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.},

abstract = {This paper considers the framework of the so-called "market basket problem", in which a database of transactions is mined for the occurrence of unusually frequent item sets. In our case, "unusually frequent" involves estimates of the frequency of each item set divided by a baseline frequency computed as if items occurred independently. The focus is on obtaining reliable estimates of this measure of interestingness for all item sets, even item sets with relatively low frequencies. For example, in a medical database of patient histories, unusual item sets including the item "patient death" (or other serious adverse event) might hopefully be flagged with as few as 5 or 10 occurrences of the item set, it being unacceptable to require that item sets occur in as many as 0.1% of millions of patient reports before the data mining algorithm detects a signal. Similar considerations apply in fraud detection applications. Thus we abandon the requirement that interesting item sets must contain a relatively large fixed minimal support, and adopt a criterion based on the results of fitting an empirical Bayes model to the item set counts. The model allows us to define a 95% Bayesian lower confidence limit for the "interestingness" measure of every item set, whereupon the item sets can be ranked according to their empirical Bayes confidence limits. For item sets of size J &gt; 2, we also distinguish between multi-item associations that can be explained by the observed J(J-1)/2 pairwise associations, and item sets that are significantly more frequent than their pairwise associations would suggest. Such item sets can uncover complex or synergistic mechanisms generating multi-item associations. This methodology has been applied within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to databases of adverse drug reaction reports and within AT&amp;T to customer international calling histories. We also present graphical techniques for exploring and understanding the modeling results.},

abstract = {Instead of a standard support vector machine (SVM) that classifies points by assigning them to one of two disjoint half-spaces, points are classified by assigning them to the closest of two parallel planes (in input or feature space) that are pushed apart as far as possible. This formulation, which can also be interpreted as regularized least squares and considered in the much more general context of regularized networks [8, 9], leads to an extremely fast and simple algorithm for generating a linear or nonlinear classifier that merely requires the solution of a single system of linear equations. In contrast, standard SVMs solve a quadratic or a linear program that require considerably longer computational time. Computational results on publicly available datasets indicate that the proposed proximal SVM classifier has comparable test set correctness to that of standard SVM classifiers, but with considerably faster computational time that can be an order of magnitude faster. The linear proximal SVM can easily handle large datasets as indicated by the classification of a 2 million point 10-attribute set in 20.8 seconds. All computational results are based on 6 lines of MATLAB code.},

abstract = {Recently we presented a new approach [18] to the classification problem arising in data mining. It is based on the regularization network approach but, in contrast to other methods which employ ansatz functions associated to data points, we use a grid in the usually high-dimensional feature space for the minimization process. To cope with the curse of dimensionality, we employ sparse grids [49]. Thus, only O(hn-1nd-1) instead of O(hn-d) grid points and unknowns are involved. Here d denotes the dimension of the feature space and hn = 2-n gives the mesh size. We use the sparse grid combination technique [28] where the classification problem is discretized and solved on a sequence of conventional grids with uniform mesh sizes in each dimension. The sparse grid solution is then obtained by linear combination. In contrast to our former work, where d-linear functions were used, we now apply linear basis functions based on a simplicial discretization. This allows to handle more dimensions and the algorithm needs less operations per data point.We describe the sparse grid combination technique for the classification problem, give implementational details and discuss the complexity of the algorithm. It turns out that the method scales linearly with the number of given data points. Finally we report on the quality of the classifier built by our new method on data sets with up to 10 dimensions. It turns out that our new method achieves correctness rates which are competitive to that of the best existing methods.},

abstract = {Most statistical and machine-learning algorithms assume that the data is a random sample drawn from a stationary distribution. Unfortunately, most of the large databases available for mining today violate this assumption. They were gathered over months or years, and the underlying processes generating them changed during this time, sometimes radically. Although a number of algorithms have been proposed for learning time-changing concepts, they generally do not scale well to very large databases. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for mining decision trees from continuously-changing data streams, based on the ultra-fast VFDT decision tree learner. This algorithm, called CVFDT, stays current while making the most of old data by growing an alternative subtree whenever an old one becomes questionable, and replacing the old with the new when the new becomes more accurate. CVFDT learns a model which is similar in accuracy to the one that would be learned by reapplying VFDT to a moving window of examples every time a new example arrives, but with O(1) complexity per example, as opposed to O(w), where w is the size of the window. Experiments on a set of large time-changing data streams demonstrate the utility of this approach.},

Star Coordinates is proposed as a new multi-dimensional visualization technique, which supports various interactions to stimulate visual thinking in early stages of knowledge discovery process. In Star Coordinates, coordinate axes are arranged on a two-dimensional surface, where each axis shares the same origin point. Each multi-dimensional data element is represented by a point, where each attribute of the data contributes to its location through uniform encoding. Interaction features of Star Coordinates provide users the ability to apply various transformations dynamically, integrate and separate dimensions, analyze correlations of multiple dimensions, view clusters, trends, and outliers in the distribution of data, and query points based on data ranges. Our experience with Star Coordinates shows that it is particularly useful for the discovery of hierarchical clusters, and analysis of multiple factors providing insight in various real datasets including telecommunications churn.},

abstract = {The problem of similarity search (query-by-content) has attracted much research interest. It is a difficult problem because of the inherently high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Piecewise Polynomial Approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for using ensembles of two or more representations for more efficient indexing. The basic idea is that instead of committing to a single representation for an entire dataset, different representations are chosen for indexing different parts of the database. The representations are chosen based upon a local view of the database. For example, sections of the data that can achieve a high fidelity representation with wavelets are indexed as wavelets, but highly spectral sections of the data are indexed using the Fourier transform. At query time, it is necessary to search several small heterogeneous indices, rather than one large homogeneous index. As we will theoretically and empirically demonstrate this results in much faster query response times.},

abstract = {For many KDD operations, such as nearest neighbor search, distance-based clustering, and outlier detection, there is an underlying Îº-D data space in which each tuple/object is represented as a point in the space. In the presence of differing scales, variability, correlation, and/or outliers, we may get unintuitive results if an inappropriate space is used.The fundamental question that this paper addresses is: "What then is an appropriate space?" We propose using a robust space transformation called the Donoho-Stahel estimator. In the first half of the paper, we show the key properties of the estimator. Of particular importance to KDD applications involving databases is the stability property, which says that in spite of frequent updates, the estimator does not: (a) change much, (b) lose its usefulness, or (c) require re-computation. In the second half, we focus on the computation of the estimator for high-dimensional databases. We develop randomized algorithms and evaluate how well they perform empirically. The novel algorithm we develop called the Hybrid-random algorithm is, in most cases, at least an order of magnitude faster than the Fixed-angle and Subsampling algorithms.},

abstract = {We present the application of Feature Mining techniques to the Developmental Therapeutics Program's AIDS antiviral screen database. The database consists of 43576 compounds, which were measured for their capability to protect human cells from HIV-1 infection. According to these measurements, the compounds were classified as either active, moderately active or inactive. The distribution of classes is extremely skewed: Only 1.3 % of the molecules is known to be active, and 2.7 % is known to be moderately active.Given this database, we were interested in molecular substructures (i.e., features) that are frequent in the active molecules, and infrequent in the inactives. In data mining terms, we focused on features with a minimum support in active compounds and a maximum support in inactive compounds. We analyzed the database using the levelwise version space algorithm that forms the basis of the inductive query and database system MOLFEA (Molecular Feature Miner). Within this framework, it is possible to declaratively specify the features of interest, such as the frequency of features on (possibly different) datasets as well as on the generality and syntax of them. Assuming that the detected substructures are causally related to biochemical mechanisms, it should be possible to facilitate the development of new pharmaceuticals with improved activities.},

abstract = {Ever since the beginning of the Web, finding useful information from the Web has been an important problem. Existing approaches include keyword-based search, wrapper-based information extraction, Web query and user preferences. These approaches essentially find information that matches the user's explicit specifications. This paper argues that this is insufficient. There is another type of information that is also of great interest, i.e., unexpected information, which is unanticipated by the user. Finding unexpected information is useful in many applications. For example, it is useful for a company to find unexpected information bout its competitors, e.g., unexpected services and products that its competitors offer. With this information, the company can learn from its competitors and/or design counter measures to improve its competitiveness. Since the number of pages of a typical commercial site is very large and there are also many relevant sites (competitors), it is very difficult for a human user to view each page to discover the unexpected information. Automated assistance is needed. In this paper, we propose a number of methods to help the user find various types of unexpected information from his/her competitors' Web sites. Experiment results show that these techniques are very useful in practice and also efficient.},

Hence, models learned from such data may be subject to limitations, the nature of which has not been well studied. Understanding the limitations is particularly important since most current personalization techniques are based on site-centric data only. In this paper, we empirically examine the implications of learning from incomplete data in the context of two specific problems: (a) predicting if the remainder of any given session will result in a purchase and (b) predicting if a given user will make a purchase at any future session. For each of these problems we present new algorithms for fast and accurate data preprocessing of clickstream data. Based on a comprehensive experiment on user-level clickstream data gathered from 20,000 users' browsing behavior, we demonstrate that models built on user-centric data outperform models built on site-centric data for both prediction tasks.},

We formulate two versions of the querying problem: the query selectivity estimation (i.e., finding exact counts for tuples in a data set) and the query generalization problem (i.e., computing the probability that a tuple will occur in new data). We show that frequent itemsets are useful for reducing the original data to a compressed representation and introduce a method to store them using an ADTree data structure. In an extension of our earlier work on this topic we propose several new schemes for query answering based on the compressed representation that avoid direct scans of the data at query time. Experimental results on real-world transaction data sets provide insights into various tradeoffs involving the offline time for model-building, the online time for query-answering, the memory footprint of the compressed data, and the accuracy of the estimate provided to the query.},

abstract = {Game sites on the World Wide Web draw people from around the world with specialized interests, skills, and knowledge. Data from the games often reflects the players' expertise and will to win. We extract probabilistic forecasts from data obtained from three online games: the Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX), the Foresight Exchange (FX), and the Formula One Pick Six (F1P6) competition. We find that all three yield accurate forecasts of uncertain future events. In particular, prices of so-called "movie stocks" on HSX are good indicators of actual box office returns. Prices of HSX securities in Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy awards correlate well with observed frequencies of winning. FX prices are reliable indicators of future developments in science and technology. Collective predictions from players in the F1 competition serve as good forecasts of true race outcomes. In some cases, forecasts induced from game data are more reliable than expert opinions. We argue that web games naturally attract well-informed and well-motivated players, and thus offer a valuable and oft-overlooked source of high-quality data with significant predictive value.},

The algorithm exploits sparseness of the underlying data to find large groups of items that are correlated over database records (rows). The notion of transaction coverage allows us to extend the algorithm and view it as a fast clustering algorithm for discovering segments of similar transactions in binary sparse data. We evaluate the new algorithm on three real-world applications: clustering high-dimensional data, query selectivity estimation and collaborative filtering. Results show that the algorithm consistently uncovers structure in large sparse databases that other traditional clustering algorithms fail to find.},

abstract = {In many data mining domains, misclassification costs are different for different examples, in the same way that class membership probabilities are example-dependent. In these domains, both costs and probabilities are unknown for test examples, so both cost estimators and probability estimators must be learned. After discussing how to make optimal decisions given cost and probability estimates, we present decision tree and naive Bayesian learning methods for obtaining well-calibrated probability estimates. We then explain how to obtain unbiased estimators for example-dependent costs, taking into account the difficulty that in general, probabilities and costs are not independent random variables, and the training examples for which costs are known are not representative of all examples. The latter problem is called sample selection bias in econometrics. Our solution to it is based on Nobel prize-winning work due to the economist James Heckman. We show that the methods we propose perform better than MetaCost and all other known methods, in a comprehensive experimental comparison that uses the well-known, large, and challenging dataset from the KDD'98 data mining contest.},

The data was encoded from text by a small team of specialists working to a well-defined protocol. The encoded data was analyzed using SOMs. Two exercises were conducted. These resulted in the linking of several offences in to clusters each of which were sufficiently similar to have possibly been committed by the same offender(s). A number of clusters were used to form profiles of offenders. Some of these profiles were confirmed by independent analysts as either belonging to known offenders or appeared sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation.The prototype was developed over 10 weeks. This contrasts with an in-house study using a conventional approach, which took 2 years to reach similar results. As a consequence of this study the NCF intends to pursue an in-depth follow up study.},

Therefore, techniques have recently been proposed to find clusters in hidden subspaces of the data. However, since the behavior of the data may vary considerably in different subspaces, it is often difficult to define the notion of a cluster with the use of simple mathematical formalizations. In fact, the meaningfulness and definition of a cluster is best characterized with the use of human intuition. In this paper, we propose a system which performs high dimensional clustering by effective cooperation between the human and the computer. The complex task of cluster creation is accomplished by a combination of human intuition and the computational support provided by the computer. The result is a system which leverages the best abilities of both the human and the computer in order to create very meaningful sets of clusters in high dimensionality.},
