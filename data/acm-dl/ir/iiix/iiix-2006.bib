abstract = {The launch of this First International Symposium on Information Interaction in Context is a significant and innovative development in the field of Information Research. It represents a new departure in providing a forum to explicitly explore the relationship between three major distinct perspectives of information research namely, Information Seeking Behaviour, laboratory and experimental Information Retrieval and Interactive Information Retrieval. Until now it has been the norm to accentuate the differences between these sub-fields and indeed there has been little agreement on recognising the value and dependency of the different approaches and paradigms. In spite of the persistent call from a number of researchers for the need for a paradigm shift from systems to user centred information research, the overall perception is that progress in accommodating the different approaches has been limited and systems based research seemingly continues to predominate.},

abstract = {Conservative recent estimates of the Web's current size refer to its 10 billion documents and a growth rate that tops 60 terabytes of new information per day [8]. In 2000 the entire World-Wide Web consisted of just 21 terabytes of information, now it grows by 3 times this every single day [5]. This growth frames the information overload problem that is threatening to stall the information revolution going forward. In short, users are finding it increasingly difficult to locate the right information at the right time in the right way. Search engine technologies are struggling to cope with the sheer quantity of information that is available, a problem that is greatly exacerbated by the apparent inability of Web users to formulate effective search queries that accurately reflect their current information needs.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the ways participants in a two-year ethnographic study judged relevance when engaged in searching and research tasks. Two experienced academics have been observed evaluating informative artefacts (documents, citations or other representations) encountered in the course of their own research projects. This study sought to explore the criteria and clues used to make decisions about the relevance of retrievable items. In presenting some of the findings from this longitudinal study, the paper demonstrates the value of this approach for enhancing our understanding of the evolving nature of human relevance judgments. The paper will describe how this interaction involves not only the notion of searcher-system communication, but a range of encounters that inform and influence that particular communication at the search interface. The paper suggests future collaboration between system specialists and human behaviour specialists to further our understanding of the socio-material systems in which people make judgments of relevance.},

The relevance judgements of users engaged in three different types of work task (different contexts) were captured through the use of questionnaires at the end of the work task. The different work tasks were chosen to represent different contexts of information use in order to establish whether the context of the information need and work task has an influence on the way that information sources are evaluated and used. It was found that the context of work task performed has a statistically significant influence on the type of relevance judgement that is made.},

Multiple techniques were used in order to understand the context in which the information flow takes place. The complexity is such that after several meetings with users the full picture is not fully detailed yet. Previously unknown documents, user roles and tasks continue to emerge while the study progresses. The conclusion is that an iterative approach should be adopted when studying highly complex environments: starting from the broadest view, each cycle progressively focuses on a sub-context to identify important details. Researchers should also keep an open mind as unexpected findings are likely to impacts on the current understanding, i.e. discovering the importance of social networks or physical inspection of the hardware as means to access information.},

The Internet was used most often, clearly displacing the print media. When problem solving information and domain information were needed, colleagues and other people were the most important information-seeking channel. It was also found that the outcomes of supportive tasks are usually hard to recognize. Supportive tasks have however, an important role in terms of collaborative information seeking and personal information management.},

The data set was obtained from the INEX 2005 Interactive Track, where a group of users searched information on travel destinations marked up in XML. The aim of this study is to determine the user preferences for element granularity and to examine how the users deal with overlapping elements. In addition, the difference in user behaviour when viewing the results in isolation or in the context of the surrounding elements is analysed. The results suggest that the users prefer element of depth 2-4 to whole documents. Users view fewer overlapping elements than expected and the user behaviour suggests the users consciously view some overlapping elements. There is almost no difference in behaviour whether the users view the element in the context of its document or in isolation.},

In this paper we use the data collected from this user study to investigate dependencies between several contextual features and the structural characteristics of the relevant components (e.g. type and number of relevant elements). The three contextual features analyzed are the user's familiarity with the topic, the request's type, and the user's motivation to perform the search. The dependencies found indicate that XML retrieval systems should also benefit from the use of contextual information.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in faceted grouping of documents for Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). It is suggested that faceted grouping can offer a flexible way of browsing a collection compared to clustering. However, the success of faceted grouping seems to rely on sufficient knowledge of collection structure. In this paper we propose an approach based on the local contexts of query terms, which is inspired by the interaction of faceted search and browsing. The use of local contexts is appealing since it requires less knowledge of the collection than existing approaches. A task-based user study was carried out to investigate the effectiveness of our interface in varied complexity. The results suggest that the local contexts can be exploited as the source of search result browsing in IIR, and that our interface appears to facilitate different aspects of search process over the task complexity. The implication of the evaluation methodology using high complexity tasks is also discussed.},

Different kinds of problems, large or small, complex or simple, continually arise and need to be dealt with. Finding information or people with specific knowledge to solve the problem may be of crucial importance. Today, a number of technologies exist facilitating this, but they are either not sophisticated enough, i.e., not providing results detailed enough, or too complicated to prepare for, e.g., tagging large amounts of information. As an alternative, we propose using ontologies to facilitate free-text searches. From an ontology, a menu-like interface can be automatically generated. Such a menu can replace searching with navigation. To demonstrate our ideas, we present Context Browser, a tool providing ontology based navigation in structured and unstructured information spaces.},

abstract = {The importance of context in meeting user information needs has gained increasing interest. When developing interactive information retrieval systems, we do need to consider how contextual information might be used to improve information retrieval. In this paper, we present a user-centred experiment that focuses on three potential context attributes. These are time, location, and user's interest. The experiment involved tasks using a scenario that would be suitable for mobile situations - one very promising area for the application of context information that can help to deliver personalised services. The scenario involves situations with local events such as jazz concerts and includes the use of a simplified map to help visualise locations. The effect of the three attributes and the interactions between them are analysed and discussed. The effects in most cases were considerable and data analysis showed statistically significant effects. The study shows that time, location, and interest matter to users in mobile situations. There appears to be a priority emerging in the relative importance of these attributes for the mobile user. Also, the results show high order interaction effects between the attributes.},

This paper presents an empirical study of polyrepresentation of the information space with focus on inter and intra-document features. The Cystic Fibrosis test collection indexed in a best match system constitutes the experimental setting. Overlaps between four functionally and/or cognitively different representations are identified. Supporting the principle of polyrepresentation, results show that in general overlaps generated by three or four representations have higher precision than those generated from one or two overlaps both in structured and unstructured search mode. It is concluded that a highly structured query language is necessary when implementing the principle of polyrepresentation in a best match IR system because the principle is inherently Boolean. Finally a re-ranking test shows promising results when search results are re-ranked according to precision obtained in the overlaps.},

The process of image selection was modeled and selection criteria were studied based on interviews, observation and a survey. The results indicate that most image queries and requests dealt with specific entities, but that object types were also common. Thematic image needs seem to be fulfilled by end-user searching and browsing rather than by requests. Image retrieval tasks were highly influenced by contextual factors. Relevance assessments were made at situational level using several types of criteria, including abstract and affective factors. Several types of collaborative searches were observed. Richer research and analysis methods are needed to characterize journalists' image needs and searching behavior.},

During the stages, the journalist gradually develops the program idea into a detailed script. The needs for archive video also evolve with the stages towards increasing specificity. The high level of uncertainty at the planning stage often leads to intense and unfocused searching of the archive and to a collection of a pile of textual listings of video material potentially useful in the task. The pile of materials at hand was consulted frequently especially in lengthy productions like documentaries. The perceived availability of archive and shot video obviously affected the content of the final script. A special limitation of the conventional archive and one reason for maintaining the pile of textual listings is that the journalist often sees the audiovisual contents of retrieved videos very late in the work process. The paper discusses the potential changes in the journalistic work process and the needs for archive video in the case of integrated video retrieval systems supporting instant access to audiovisual contents in addition to textual annotations.},

abstract = {This paper presents methods for correlating a human performer and a synthetic accompaniment based on Implicit Relevance Feedback (IRF) using Graugaard's expanded model for interactive music (Graugaard 2006c). The research is the result of experience with practical work with interactive music systems developed 2004-06 for a body of commissioned works and is based on human perception of music as an expressive artform where musically significant data may be present not only in the audio signal but also in human gestures and in physiological data. The relevance and feasibility of including expression and emotion as a high-level signal processing means for bridging man and machine is discussed. The resulting model is multi-level (physical, sensorial, perceptual, formal, expressive) and multi-modal (sound, human gesture, physiological), which makes it applicable to purely musical contexts, as well as intermodal contexts where music is combined with visual and/or physiological data.},

abstract = {We present results of a preliminary study of a pile-based information retrieval interface that supports contextual relevance feedback. We designed two interfaces based on the pile metaphor, one which supported contextual relevance feedback and the other which did not, and conducted a within-subjects laboratory evaluation with 24 subjects. Results demonstrate support for the pile-based approach generally, with users indicating that it assisted them in structuring and managing their search results. There were significant differences between usability assessments of each interface and in the interactions in which subjects engaged while they were seeking information. Although we found no significant differences in performance between interfaces, subjects showed a strong preference for the contextual relevance feedback interface over the other, and believed that they did better with that interface.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an alternative approach to the problem of contextual relevance feedback in web-based information retrieval. Our approach utilises a rich contextual model that exploits a user's implicit and explicit data. Each user's implicit data are gathered from their Internet search histories on their local machine. The user's explicit data are captured from a lexical database, a shared contextual knowledge base and domain-specific concepts using data mining techniques and a relevance feedback approach. This data is later used by our approach to modify queries to more accurately reflect the user's interests as well as to continually build the user's contextual profile and a shared contextual knowledge base. Finally, the approach retrieves personalised or contextual search results from the search engine using the modified/expanded query. Preliminary experiments indicate that our approach has the potential to not only aid in the contextual relevance feedback but also contribute towards the long term goal of intelligent relevance feedback in web-based information retrieval.},

abstract = {The faceted classification system of information interactions proposed by Cool and Belkin is discussed in the light of two case studies. The two examples use the classification scheme as a structural research instrument in two different phases of investigation: in framing the collection of data and in the analysis of already existing data. The discussion is focussed on usability and the issues related to the classification scheme. We conclude that the proposed scheme is a workable instrument for studying complex information interactions with different kinds of research designs. The either premisory or post-collection use of the classification scheme was recognised to have effects on the classification outcome. The principal issues of using the scheme seemed to relate to the frequent overlap of the facets and the tendency of the classifications to be highly dependent on the perspectives of the study.},

The diary focused on group members' activities and emotional experiences during a project assignment, but differed in both design and usage between the two case studies, e.g. between a structured diary with fixed response-categories and an unstructured diary with no response-categories; between an electronic and a manually kept diary; and between four weeks and one week at three selected points. The diary method was found to generate useful data on group members' actions and behavior, though also stressing the importance of a proper introduction, training, a free format with minor structure, practical feasibility, and participant motivation. As a side effect, both diaries turned out to serve as an instrument for group members' reflection and project management.},

The common theme of these projects is that they addressed information use by users who were neither academics or information professionals. This generates a picture of information use not often seen in the LIS literature, and shows some interesting differences between professional and non-professional information use, particularly in the areas of organisational and social context. The value of Ingwersen and J\"{a}rvelin's framework is shown in that it promotes the identification of commonalities between the different projects, promotes explanations of some of the observations made in the three projects, and suggests an agenda for future work.},

The paper departs from the concept of rationality as it is expressed in the standards of information literacy and confronts this concept against the rationality that lies behind students' actual information behaviour. In the paper some of the main results from the research are presented. The analysis departs from two different cluster analyses. One of them is formed on the basis of the intensity of the students use of physical libraries, web based services and the frequency of use. The other cluster analysis is formed on variables that express the students' perception of educational requirements. For both cluster analyses the information behaviour, study style and the exposure in relation to information literacy is discussed. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},
