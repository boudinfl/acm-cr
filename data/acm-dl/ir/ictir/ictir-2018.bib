abstract = {Implicit user feedback (such as clicks and dwell time) is an important source of data for modern search engines. While heavily biased~citejoachims2005accurately,keane2006modeling,joachims2007evaluating,yue2010beyond, it is cheap to collect and particularly useful for user-centric retrieval applications such as search ranking and query recommendation. Understanding the bias inherent in current systems and designing learning to rank algorithms that can effectively learn from implicit user feedback without bias is an important research direction that can significantly improve the quality of modern search engines. To develop such anunbiased learning-to-rank (ULTR) system, previous studies have focused on constructing probabilistic graphical models (e.g., click models) with user behavior hypothesis to extract and train ranking systems with unbiased relevance signals. Recently, a novel counterfactual learning framework that estimates and adopts examination propensity for unbiased learning to rank has attracted much attention, both in academia and industry. Despite its popularity, there is no systematic comparison and analysis of the unbiased learning-to-rank frameworks based on graphical models and counterfactual learning. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of the fundamental mechanism and algorithms for unbiased learning to rank. We describe and analyze the theory behind each learning framework, and give detailed instructions on how to conduct unbiased learning to rank in practice.},

This thread of research has attracted more information retrieval (IR) researchers in recent years, as evidenced by the establishment of the ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval series (CHIIR). Given recent interests in machine learning, social media data analysis and emerging system-oriented interactive search models, this course provides students with a more complete picture for understanding user search behaviour and user-oriented approaches for the evaluation of IR systems. It emphasises how user aspects should be addressed from theoretical, conceptual, design and evaluation perspectives for IR theory and system development.

abstract = {I think that the vision of a search engine is "Natural Search" with which users input his or her search intent in a natural way such as using natural language or an image and immediately obtains the desired accurate information which is concisely and comprehensibly expressed. During this process, NLP is undoubtedly one of the most crucial technologies. In the past, the search engine uses limited and shallow NLP technologies because NLP technology is not as mature as people have expected. In recent years, we have witnessed that NLP has made huge advances in various tasks such as semantic parser, question-answering, machine translation, machine reading comprehension and text generation. I think that now it is the time to consider applying these new technologies to a search engine to further improve the intelligence and naturalness of the search process. It is necessary to understand the new progress of NLP and their potential impact to a search engine. In this talk, I first provide an overview of advancements of methodology and technology in NLP filed in recent years. Then I will share my thoughts about the promising change of search engines brought by these new NLP technologies. I will further elaborate my thoughts on changing search engine with a set of intelligent question-answering techniques comprising semantic parser, question-answering and machine reading comprehension. Although these new promising NLP have rapidly brought meaningful change to a search engine, there are still many problems unsolved. As a conclusion, a list of the challenging topics will be proposed with my initial thoughts of solutions.},

How to best leverage such dependency structures from multiple graphs with massive and heterogeneous types of nodes and relations has posed grand challenges to machine learning theory and algorithms.

abstract = {In order to provide personalized recommendations, collaborative filtering algorithms take into account several kinds of feedback from the user. A common kind of feedback, which was largely neglected by the Academic community until recently, is textual reviews that are written by the users. Reviews may reveal a great deal about both the users and the items, and indeed in recent years, several algorithms that make use of textual reviews were proposed. However, it is not entirely clear how this signal should be combined with traditional methods that address other kinds of feedback (such as an explicit numeric rating). In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm, named Collaborative Filtering using Compatibility Vectors (CFCV), which builds upon recent advances in natural language understanding, and uses a neural network in order to provide a meaningful representation of the reviews. This allows to enhance collaborative filtering (particularly, factor methods ) with this new kind of information, in a way that is both natural and effective. We validate our algorithm by conducting experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms the existing methods. Moreover, underlying our solution there is a general architecture that may be further explored.},

abstract = {Recommending venues plays a critical rule in satisfying users' needs on location-based social networks. Recent studies have explored the idea of adopting collaborative ranking (CR) for recommendation, combining the idea of learning to rank and collaborative filtering. However, CR suffers from the sparsity problem, mainly because it associates similar users based on exact matching of the venues in their check-in history. Even though research in collaborative filtering has shown that considering auxiliary information such as geographical influence, helps the model to alleviate the sparsity problem, the same direction still needs to be explored in CR. In this work, we present a CR framework that focuses on the top of the ranked list while integrating an arbitrary number of similarity functions between venues as it learns the model's parameters. We further introduce three example similarity measures based on venues' contents and locations. Incorporating cross-venue similarity measures into the model enhances the latent associations between users as similar venues are also taken into account while associating users with each other. Our experiments on the TREC Contextual Suggestion dataset show that our proposed CR model beats other state-of-the-art venue suggestion methods.},

abstract = {Personalized recommendation has become increasingly pervasive nowadays. Users receive recommendations on products, movies, point-of-interests and other online services. Traditional collaborative filtering techniques have demonstrated effectiveness in a wide range of recommendation tasks, but they are unable to capture complex relationships between users and items. There is a surge of interest in applying deep learning to recommender systems due to its nonlinear modeling capacity and recent success in other domains such as computer vision and speech recognition. However, prior work does not incorporate contexual information, which is usually largely available in many recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model for contexual recommendation. Specifically, the model consists of a denoising autoencoder neural network architecture augmented with a context-driven attention mechanism, referred to as Attentive Contextual Denoising Autoencoder (ACDA). The attention mechanism is utilized to encode the contextual attributes into the hidden representation of the user's preference, which associates personalized context with each user's preference to provide recommendation targeted to that specific user. Experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets from Meetup and Movielens on event and movie recommendations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art recommenders.},

Our empirical analysis demonstrates that, those QPP methods that utilize passage-level information are much better suited for verbose QPP settings.

abstract = {In this paper, we study jointly query reformulation and document relevance estimation, the two essential aspects of information retrieval (IR). Their interactions are modelled as a two-player strategic game: one player, a query formulator, taking actions to produce the optimal query, is expected to maximize its own utility with respect to the relevance estimation of documents produced by the other player, a retrieval modeler; simultaneously, the retrieval modeler, taking actions to produce the document relevance scores, needs to optimize its likelihood from the training data with respect to the refined query produced by the query formulator. Their equilibrium or equilibria will be reached when both are the best responses to each other. We derive our equilibrium theory of IR using normal-form representations: when a standard relevance feedback algorithm is coupled with a retrieval model, they would share the same objective function and thus form a partnership game; by contrast, pseudo relevance feedback pursues a rather different objective than that of retrieval models, therefore the interaction between them would lead to a general-sum game (though implicitly collaborative). Our game-theoretical analyses not only yield useful insights into the two major aspects of IR, but also offer new practical algorithms for achieving the equilibrium state of retrieval which have been shown to bring consistent performance improvements in both text retrieval and item recommendation.},

The main idea of this paper is to generate large amounts of synthetic training data from a small seed set of hand-labeled keyword-question pairs. Since natural language questions are available in large quantities, we develop models to automatically generate the corresponding keyword queries. Further, we introduce various filtering mechanisms to ensure that synthetic training data is of high quality. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using both automatic and manual evaluation.},

Depending on the structure of the models, previous deep IR models could be roughly divided into: representation-based models and interaction-based models. A number of experiments have been conducted to test these models, but often under different conditions, making it difficult to draw a clear conclusion on their comparison. In order to compare the two learning schemas for ad hoc search under the same condition, we build similar convolution networks to learn either representations or interaction patterns between document and query and test them on the same test collection. In addition, we also propose multi-level matching models to cope with various types of query, rather than the existing single-level matching. Our experiments show that interaction-based approach generally performs better than representation-based approach, and multi-level matching performs better than single-level matching. We will provide some possible explanations to these observations.},

We input natural language processing datasets into a trained answer passage neural network. Each layer of the neural network is used as input into a unique classifier, or probe, to correctly label that input with respect to a natural language processing task, probing the internal representations for information. Using this approach, we analyze the information relevant to retrieving answer passages from the perspective of information needed for part of speech tagging, named entity retrieval, sentiment classification, and textual entailment. We show a significant information need difference between two seemingly similar question answering collections, and demonstrate that passage retrieval and textual entailment share a common information space, while POS and NER information is used only at a compositional level in the lower layers of an information retrieval model. Lastly, we demonstrate that incorporating this information into a multitask environment is correlated to the information retained by these models during the probe inspection phase.},

abstract = {One of the most significant bottleneck in training large scale machine learning models on parameter server (PS) is the communication overhead, because it needs to frequently exchange the model gradients between the workers and servers during the training iterations. Gradient quantization has been proposed as an effective approach to reducing the communication volume. One key issue in gradient quantization is setting the number of bits for quantizing the gradients. Small number of bits can significantly reduce the communication overhead while hurts the gradient accuracies, and vise versa. An ideal quantization method would dynamically balance the communication overhead and model accuracy, through adjusting the number bits according to the knowledge learned from the immediate past training iterations. Existing methods, however, quantize the gradients either with fixed number of bits, or with predefined heuristic rules. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive quantization method within the framework of reinforcement learning. The method, referred to as MQGrad, formalizes the selection of quantization bits as actions in a Markov decision process (MDP) where the MDP states records the information collected from the past optimization iterations (e.g., the sequence of the loss function values). During the training iterations of a machine learning algorithm, MQGrad continuously updates the MDP state according to the changes of the loss function. Based on the information, MDP learns to select the optimal actions (number of bits) to quantize the gradients. Experimental results based on a benchmark dataset showed that MQGrad can accelerate the learning of a large scale deep neural network while keeping its prediction accuracies.},

Our approach is based on the observations that there are fewer than ten subtopics for most queries, most relevant results cover only a few subtopics, and most search users only focus on the top results. The proposed pruned exhaustive search algorithm based on ordered pairs (PesOP) finds the optimal solution efficiently. Experimental results based on TREC Diversity and NTCIR Intent task datasets show that PesOP outperforms greedy strategies with better diversification performance. Compared with the original non-pruned exhaustive search, the PesOP algorithm decreases the computational cost while maintaining optimality.},

abstract = {In microblog retrieval, query expansion can be essential to obtain good search results due to the short size of queries and posts. Since information in microblogs is highly dynamic, an up-to-date index coupled with pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) with an external corpus has a higher chance of retrieving more relevant documents and improving ranking. In this paper, we focus on the research question:how can we reduce the query expansion computational cost while maintaining the same retrieval precision as standard PRF? Therefore, we propose to accelerate the query expansion step of pseudo-relevance feedback. The hypothesis is that using an expansion corpus organized into verticals for expanding the query, will lead to a more efficient query expansion process and improved retrieval effectiveness. Thus, the proposed query expansion method uses a distributed search architecture and resource selection algorithms to provide an efficient query expansion process. Experiments on the TREC Microblog datasets show that the proposed approach can match or outperform standard PRF in MAP and NDCG@30, with a computational cost that is three orders of magnitude lower.},

abstract = {Topic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are employed effectively in various information retrieval and data mining tasks. Despite their popularity and wide-spread application, the question of assessing the quality of topics extracted by LDA models is still not completely resolved. While various measures have been proposed to quantify the thematic coherence and interpretability of a topic extracted by LDA, they do not address this problem sufficiently. We observe that existing quality measures select top topic words based on their topic-word co-occurrence without considering word co-occurrences within the same context. We incorporate precisely this information by constructing topic-specific graphs capturing neighborhood of words in an LDA modeled corpus. Next, the PageRank algorithm is applied on these graphs to assign word importance scores based on centrality. We propose two measures to compute topic quality: (1) the Aggregate PageRank of Top-words of a topic and (2) the PageRank Centralization Index of a topic-specific word graph. Our experiments across three datasets show that unlike existing quality measures, our proposed measures are able to identify topics that are discriminative as well as interpretable and yield superior performance on both classification and intruder word identification tasks.},

Recent work has moved toward detecting and predicting task from browsing behavior but has not additionally considered user or session characteristics that clearly affect browsing. To what extent should user characteristics and unlogged traits be considered when inferring task type from browsing behavior? This paper examines this complex relationship through the lens of path analysis, showing that such a holistic view should be considered in future task prediction research.

abstract = {Search in meta-data is challenging due to the sparsity of the available textual information. To alleviate the sparsity problem, the paper in hand evolves from the existing document expansion paradigm and proposes pseudo-descriptions as a new paradigm. Instead of encoding paradigmatic term relations implicitly in an expansion vector, we generate an explicit cohesive text field for meta-data records that describes the entity associated with the record. In contrast to document expansions, pseudo-descriptions allow to reveal why a certain document is considered relevant although the original meta-data does not contain the query terms. Moreover, they are easier to operationalize and facilitate the use of sophisticated retrieval features such as phrase search and query term proximity. To generate pseudo-descriptions, we propose a relevance dependent strategy that depends on the search engine result pages obtained from issuing the meta-data as a search query to a designated reference search engine. To demonstrate the validity of the pseudo-description paradigm, we experiment with different TREC collections where we withhold the content information to simulate a meta-data retrieval scenario. Though retrieval with full content information remains superior, our approach achieves retrieval performance improvements en par with document expansion.},

abstract = {Neural network approaches have recently shown to be effective in several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, neural approaches often require large volumes of training data to perform effectively, which is not always available. To mitigate the shortage of labeled data, training neural IR models with weak supervision has been recently proposed and received considerable attention in the literature. In weak supervision, an existing model automatically generates labels for a large set of unlabeled data, and a machine learning model is further trained on the generated "weak" data. Surprisingly, it has been shown in prior art that the trained neural model can outperform the weak labeler by a significant margin. Although these obtained improvements have been intuitively justified in previous work, the literature still lacks theoretical justification for the observed empirical findings. In this paper, we provide a theoretical insight into weak supervision for information retrieval, focusing on learning to rank. We model the weak supervision signal as a noisy channel that introduces noise to the correct ranking. Based on the risk minimization framework, we prove that given some sufficient constraints on the loss function, weak supervision is equivalent to supervised learning under uniform noise. We also find an upper bound for the empirical risk of weak supervision in case of non-uniform noise. Following the recent work on using multiple weak supervision signals to learn more accurate models, we find an information theoretic lower bound on the number of weak supervision signals required to guarantee an upper bound for the pairwise error probability. We empirically verify a set of presented theoretical findings, using synthetic and real weak supervision data.},

The challenging task of expanding entity sets on social media text is to extract more uncommon entities only using several seeds already in hand. In this paper, we present an approach which is able to find novel entities by expanding a small initial seed set on Twitter text. Our method first generates candidate sets on the basis of the semantic similarity feature. Then it jointly utilizes 2 text-based features and other 12 ones which carry social media specific information. With the scores on those features, a ranking model is learned by a supervised algorithm to synthetically score each candidate terms and then the final ranked list is taken as the target expanded set. We do experiments with 24 entity classes on the Twitter corpus and in the expanded sets there come many novel entities which have not been completely detected in previous researches. And the experimental results on the datasets of different years can perfectly consist with the objective law that fresh entities change as time goes on.},

Unlike previous works that put attention mechanism after all steps of GRU, we add the entire representation to the input of the GRU which means the GRU model takes the entire information of the sequence into consideration in every step. We provide three various strategies to adding the entire information which are the Convolutional Neural Network~(CNN) based attentive GRU~(CBAG), the GRU inner attentive GRU~(GIAG) and the pre-trained GRU inner attentive GRU~(Pre-GIAG). To evaluate our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on a benchmark sentiment classification dataset.

abstract = {Web search engines are typically designed to involve multiple pages of search results, and the search users engaging in exploratory search with ad hoc queries are likely to access more than one result pages. The ranking of web pages for such queries should consider additional information other than the original query, e.g., the user clicks on previous result pages. Existing methods that utilize this kind of information usually involve relevance feedback, which uses the feedback information to explore the user's intent. However, due to the limitation of the feedback mechanism, it is difficult to apply existing relevance feedback techniques to state-of-the-art learning to rank models. In this paper, we propose a novel learning to rank model for multi page search in which the user's feedback can be naturally utilized for improving the ranking of next result page. The model, referred to as MDP-MPS, formalizes the ranking of documents in multi page search as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the search engine corresponds to the agent for constructing the document rankings in the result pages, and the user corresponds to the environment for judging the rankings and providing rewards. The policy gradient algorithm of REINFORCE is adopted for learning the model parameters. Experimental results on OHSUMED dataset showed that our approach outperformed the baselines of traditional relevance ranking model of ListNet and relevance feedback method of Rocchio.},

As one of the most successful applications among them, Quantum Language Model (QLM) achieves superior performances compared to various classical models on ad-hoc retrieval tasks. However, the EM-based estimation strategy for QLM is limited in that it cannot efficiently converge to global optimum. As a result, subsequent QLM-based models are more or less restricted to a limited vocabulary. In order to ease this limitation, this study investigates a query expansion framework on the QLM basis. Essentially, the additional terms are selected from the constructed QLM of top-K returned documents in the initial ranking, and a re-ranking is conducted on the expanded query to generate the final ranks. Experiments on TREC 2013 and 2014 session track datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

The combination of distinct theoretical frameworks may be the key to making an important step forward toward a stable and significant improvement in classification effectiveness and, to the same extent improved Quantum Mechanics (QM) signal detection. QM may give rise to a new theoretical framework for classification, since it essentially moves the optimal bound of effectiveness beyond the levels made possible by the state-of-the-art classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose a binary classification model inspired by quantum detection theory in an effort to investigate how much benefit it brings as compared to classical models. Our experiments suggest that the improvement in classification effectiveness can be obtained, although the potential of quantum detection can only be partially exploited.},

abstract = {Topic set size design is an approach to determining the sample sizes of an experiment (e.g., number of topics) based on a statistical requirement, namely a desired statistical power or a cap on the confidence interval (CI) width for the difference in means. Previous work considered paired data cases for a desired power of the t-test and for a cap on CI width, as well as unpaired data cases for a desired power of one-way ANOVA. In the present study, we consider unpaired (i.e., two-sample) cases for the t-test and for the CI width. Since one-way ANOVA with two groups is strictly equivalent to the two-sample t-test, we compare the outcomes of the topic set size design results based on these two approaches, and show that the one-way ANOVA-based approach actually returns tighter sample sizes than the two-sample t-test approach. Moreover, we compare the paired and unpaired cases for both t-test-based and CI-based topic set size design approaches. Because estimating the variance of the score differences for the paired data setting is problematic, we recommend the use of our unpaired-data versions of t-test-based and CI-based topic set size design tools, as they only require a variance estimate for individual scores and the appropriate sample sizes for unpaired data are also large enough for paired data.},

abstract = {The usage of positive relevance feedback in fusion-based retrieval was previously shown to be very useful. Yet, in many retrieval use-cases, no actual relevance feedback may be available. With the absence of relevance data, pseudo-relevance feedback models have been suggested as an alternative. Encouraged by the previous success of using positive relevance feedback in fusion-based retrieval, in this work, we study the usage of pseudo-relevance feedback in this setting as well. We build on top of an existing approach that was originally designed for utilizing positive relevance feedback and adapt it to pseudo-relevance feedback. To this end, we propose a novel approach for estimating document (pseudo) relevance labels. Our labeling approach is better tailored to the fusion-based retrieval setting and provides favorable retrieval quality results.},

abstract = {In Information Retrieval and Web Search, BM25 is one of the most influential probabilistic retrieval formulas for document weighting and ranking. BM25 involves three parameters $k_1$, $k_3$ and b, which provide scalar approximation and scaling of important document features such asterm frequency, document frequency, anddocument length. We investigate in this paper aggregative and statistical document features for document ranking. Shortly speaking, a statistically adjusted BM25 is used to score in an aggregative way onvirtual documents, which are generated by randomly combining documents from the original collection. The problem size, in the number of virtual documents to be ranked, is an expansion to the problem size of the original problem. As a result, ranking is actually realized through performing statistical sampling. Rejection Sampling, a simple Monte Carlo sampling method is used at present. This new framework is called StatBM25, in emphasizing first the fact that the original problem domain space is K-expanded (a concept to be further explained in the paper); Further, statistical sampling is employed in the model. Empirical studies are performed on several standard test collections, where StatBM25 demonstrates convincingly high degree of both uniqueness and effectiveness compared to BM25. This means, in our belief, that StatBM25 as a statistically smoothed and normalized variant to BM25, might eventually lead to discoveries of useful new statistic measures for document ranking.},

abstract = {Serendipity is recognized as very challenging to simulate and stimulate in recommender systems. In this paper, we adopt a novel approach to model and implement serendipity in a context of health news recommender system. The proposed conceptual framework for serendipity consists of a surprise component, a value component, and a learning component. The three components work together to reason about what information is serendipitous, defined as both surprising and valuable to a user. The implementation is through a series of computational approaches, resulting a prototype called "StumbleOn". We find that the computational approaches help identifying serendipitous recommendations, which are further improved by adaptively learning users' real-time feedback. This study contributes to the research on how to generate serendipity for users in a predictable and systematic way.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically assigning a category to a given question posted to a Community Question Answering (CQA) site, where the question contains not only text but also an image. For example, CQA users may post a photograph of a dress and ask the community "Is this appropriate for a wedding?'' where the appropriate category for this question might be "Manners, Ceremonial occasions.'' We tackle this problem using Convolutional Neural Networks with a DualNet architecture for combining the image and text representations. Our experiments with real data from Yahoo Chiebukuro and crowdsourced gold-standard categories show that the DualNet approach outperforms a text-only baseline ($p=.0000$), a sum-and-product baseline ($p=.0000$), Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling ($p=.0000$), and a combination of sum-and-product and MCB ($p=.0000$), where the p-values are based on a randomised Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test with $B = 5000$ trials.},

abstract = {Retrieving short, precise answers to non-factoid queries is an increasingly important task, especially for mobile and voice search. Many of these questions may have multiple or alternative answers. In an environment where answers are presented incrementally, this raises the question of how to generate a diverse ranking to cover these alternatives. Existing search diversification algorithms generate diverse document rankings using explicit or implicit methods based on topical similarity. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of applying these existing document diversification frameworks to the problem of answer diversification to determine if topical diversity is related to answer diversity. Using two common diversification algorithms, xQUAD and PM-2, and three question answering test collections, we show that topic diversification can help to generate more effective rankings but is not consistent across different queries and test collections.},
