abstract = {Dynamic Queries is a querying technique for doing range search on multi-key data sets. It is a direct manipulation mechanism where the query is formulated using graphical widgets and the results are displayed graphically preferably within 100 milliseconds.This paper evaluates four data structures, the multilist, the grid file, k-d tree and the quad tree used to organize data in high speed storage for dynamic queries. The effect of factors like size, distribution and dimensionality of data on the storage overhead and the speed of search is explored. Analytical models for estimating the storage and the search overheads are presented, and verified to be correct by empirical data. Results indicate that multilists are suitable for small (few thousand points) data sets irrespective of the data distribution. For large data sets the grid files are excellent for uniformly distributed data, and trees are good for skewed data distributions. There was no significant difference in performance between the tree structures.},

The intermediate layout is planar for planar graphs and attempts to come close to planar for nonplanar graphs. The system's results are significantly better, and much faster, than what the annealing approach is able to achieve on its own.},

abstract = {Research on automatic help generation fails to match the advance in user interface technology. With users and interfaces becoming increasingly sophisticated, generating help information must be presented with a close tie to the current work context. Help research also needs to utilize the media technology to become effective in conveying information to users. Our work on automatic generation of help from user interface specifications attempts to bridge the gaps, both between help and user interface making help truly sensitive to the interface context, and between the help media and the interface media making communication more direct and more effective. Our work previously reported emphasized a shared knowledge representation for both user interface and help, and an architecture for automatic generation of context-sensitive animated help in Smalltalk-80. This paper presents a new integrated architecture in C++ which not only generates animation, but also audio as procedural help. The architecture also uses the knowledge representation to automatically provide textual help of why an object in an interface is disabled.},

The script is then realized by a given animation system which computes the single frames and does the playback.BETTY is part of the multimodal user interface WIP, that investigates the plan-based automatic generation of multimodal operation instructions for technical devices.Presently, BETTY is able to compute animations to demonstrate movements, to localize parts of a device and to explode assemblies.},

AWI provides operationalizations of illustration techniques frequently used in technical illustration. Given that pure editing systems are too low-level, and that automatically generated illustrations are often suboptimal with regard to functional and aesthetic aspects, semi-automatism seems a reasonable way to produce effective illustrations more efficiently. Within such an approach the collaboration between user and system is twofold. While the user may have the system to provide a first draft which then will be refined through post editing, a user's draft may be evaluated and improved by the system as well. After an introduction of the essential concepts we base on, we give an outline of  the workbench AWI. Examples serve to show the making of illustrations with AWI in a semi-automated manner. Finally we describe potential application areas for AWI.},

abstract = {This paper describes an algorithm to detect user's mental chunks by analysis of pause lengths in goal-directed human-computer interaction. Identifying and characterizing users' chunks can help in gauging the users' level of expertise. The algorithm described in this paper works with information collected by an automatic logging mechanism. Therefore, it is applicable to situations in which no human intervention is required to perform the analysis, such as adaptive interfaces. An empirical study was conducted to validate the algorithm, showing that mental chunks and their characteristics can indeed be inferred from analysis of human-computer interaction logs. Users performing a variety of goal-directed tasks were monitored. Using an automated logging tool, every command invoked, every  operation performed with the input devices, as well as all system responses were recorded. Analysis of the interaction logs was performed by a program that implements a chunk detection algorithm that looks at command sequences and timings. The results support the hypothesis that a significant number of user mental chunks can be detected by our algorithm.},

In this project, the placement problem consists of a computer-aided visual placement of interaction objects (IO) included in a more composite IO called Presentation Unit (PU). Two strategies for placing IO within a PU are characterised and investigated: a static two-column based strategy and a dynamic right/bottom strategy. Each strategy decomposes the placement into three partially overlapping dimensions: localisation, dimensioning, and arrangement. A set of simple mathematical relationships is introduced to rate the quality of visual principles gained with the result of each strategy within  the three dimensions. This rating shows that the lack of flexibility should lead us more towards a dynamic strategy for computer-aided visual placement.},

Traditional GUI do not often go beyond such existing IO. Multimedia GUI add interactive objects such as pictures, images, video sequences that could serve as a base for sophisticated user interaction. All these types of user interfaces have in common the problem of determining a basic layout of IO. The complexity of this problem is proportional to the variety of IO accessible for the designer. This paper summarises visual techniques exported from the area of visual design to be further exploited for user interface. These visual techniques  provide the designer a wide range of means for laying out IO. A small set of guidelines for effectively applying these visual techniques is given.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the mapping of the EVER diagram into an underlying database and the construction of database views for schema versions. Through the reconstruction of views after database reorganization, changes to an ER diagram can be made transparent to the application programs while all objects in the database remain accessible to the  application programs. The EVER system can serve as a front-end for object-oriented databases.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing graphical geographic database user interfaces (GDUIs) and of integrating them into a database management system (DBMS). Geographic applications may vary widely but they all have common aspects due to the spatial component of their data: Geographic data are not standard and they require appropriate tools for (i) editing them (i.e., display and modify) and (ii) querying them. The conceptual problems encountered in designing GDUIs are partly due to the merger of two independent fields, geographic DBMSs on the one hand, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on the other hand. Although these areas have evolved considerably during the past ten years, only little effort has been made to  understand the problems of connecting them in order to efficiently manipulate geographic data on a display. This issue raises the general problem of coupling a DBMS with specialized modules (in particular, the problem of strong vs. weak integration), and more generally the role of a DBMS in a specific application. After giving the functionalities that a GDUI should provide, we study the possible conceptual integrations between a GUI and a DBMS. Finally, a map editing model as well as a general and modular GDUI architecture are presented.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal metaphors can play an important role in making the task of programming serve problem-solving processes. Visual programming research hopes to capitalize on innate human perceptual skills to make the programming task easier by using visualization to simplify program construction at the syntactic level. Instead, we advocate that the role of visualizations, and the consequent use of spatial metaphors, is not to simplify programming per se but instead to support the problem-solving process. To that end, environments endorsing spatial metaphors should support: creating and changing external representations of the problem, and opportunistic design strategies necessary for exploring problem spaces. We discuss problems with human-computer interaction schemes arising from the use of temporal metaphors. Direct-manipulation, on the one hand, can be too direct for controlling a number of autonomous processes such as cooperating agents. The complete delegation of tasks to agents, on the other hand, can leave users entirely in the role of passive observers. We propose a new approach, called the participatory theater metaphor, which combines the advantages of human computer interaction schemes based on direction manipulation and delegation and provides users with a continuous spectrum of control over their program behaviors.},

abstract = {The goal of this panel is to discuss some significant examples of current R&amp;D projects related to visual interfaces, which are part of the different R&amp;D programmes partially funded by the European Commission, and in particular of the Esprit programme. Even if the panel will concentrate on user interface issues, the scope of the presented projects is fairly broad: from user interface development technologies (as in HYPERFACE and INTERACTORS), to banking and financial environments and applications (as in FAST), to hypermedia platforms and applications (as in MINERS), to navigational user interfaces to traditional information systems (as in HIFI), to multimedia educational environments (as in MULTED), to multimedia medical information (as in MILORD), to 3D interaction with data bases (as in FADIVA). All the presented projects make large use of multimedia concepts and technologies.},

abstract = {The paper describes a method for visual systems synthesis. It stresses the importance of meaningful objects at the interface and suggests that semantics be used to derive such meaningful objects. The paper makes a distinction between the semantics of the design process and the problem domain and suggests that problem domain semantic concepts become the operands of design concepts. The paper notes the dual role of CSCW both as a problem domain in its own right and as providing semantics to describe the design process itself. The paper defines a set of formal semantics for CSCW and then describes synthesis of CSCW systems. It then describes the design process and shows how CSCW semantics can be used to define and implement a general model of the design process.},

This paper describes a technique for the semantic analysis of visual languages specified by relation grammars. The technique is based on the definition of Attribute Relation Grammars (ARG), which are an extension of attribute context-free grammars to the case of non-linear grammars. We study the static properties of an ARG under which each sentence can be translated with a cost linear in the size of the sentence.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple but very powerful technique to support user interface evaluation, along with a prototype implementation of this technique. This technique provides tools to allow the user interface evaluator to combine event streams and video recording, analyzing the event stream to search for patterns of interesting or important user actions, then using the recorded timestamps associated with these actions to present only the sections of the video recording of interest. This allows, for example, all places where the user invokes a help system or a particular command to be observed without requiring the evaluator to manually search the recording or sit through long sessions of unrelated interactions. By combining the precise recording of automatic event trace capture with the rich contextual information that can be captured in a video and audio recording, this technique allows analyses to be performed that would not be practical with either media alone.},

In this article we will describe an experimental set-up that tries to explore the possibility of integrating, under a single user interface: a) hypermedia document browsing b) data feeding to scientific visualization programs c) parameter feeding and running numerical simulation programs.},

We show how such a choice, with its resulting synergies, can lead to a multifeatured, flexible and convenient programming environment, where the application developer's tasks are remarkably simplified.},
