abstract = {Rank fusion is a powerful technique that merges multiple system runs to produce a single top-k list that often has much higher effectiveness than any single system can produce. Recently, there has been renewed interest in rank fusion in the IR community as these techniques can also be combined with query variations to produce highly effective runs. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms in the context of risk. Like many re-ranking algorithms, there is a risk-reward trade-off in rank fusion, where improving the retrieval effectiveness for most queries often comes at the expense of others. Since system performance is usually compared using only aggregate scores for an evaluation metric, the risk is potentially obscured. In this work, we explore the use of the risk-based evaluation metrics over deep and shallow evaluation goals, and show that the risk-reward payoff in keyword queries can in fact be significantly improved when careful combinations of system and query variations are fused into a single run.},

abstract = {The unsupervised clustering of biological sequences is an important task in the bioinformatics space; however, the high computational expense associated with computing pairwise distances between these sequences makes many traditional clustering approaches untenable, leading to the use of greedy algorithms that are fast but degrade poorly. In this paper we introduce a method of clustering biological sequences by first converting them into an intermediate binary format where Hamming distance is used as the metric of comparison. Following this, we use the k-means algorithm on these sequences to cluster them. We show that this approach produces results equivalent or superior to comparable biological clustering algorithms in less time.},

abstract = {Query expansion is used to overcome the vocabulary mismatch between the documents and queries, but it can lead to query drift. We propose an automatic term reweighting strategy for BM25 ranking functions. Using expansion terms obtained from general purpose thesauri, we found that reweighting through term frequency merging is more effective than standard query expansion. Instead of appending the new terms directly to the original query, we merge the term frequencies with the original query term. This reduces the impact of spurious expansion terms being over represented in the modified query.},

abstract = {Word embeddings have attracted much attention in recent years and have been heavily applied to many tasks in information retrieval, natural language processing and knowledge base construction. One of the most well noted aspects of word embeddings is their ability to capture relations between terms via simple vector offsets. This ability is often examined via the use of proportional analogy completion tasks. This task requires that the correct single term be returned by a system when prompted with the three other terms of a proportional analogy. This task usually involves a scan of all stored word embeddings which may be a relatively expensive operation when used as part of a larger system.In some preliminary experiments we show that it is quite easy to achieve significant speedups for analogy completion, with little loss of accuracy, via the use of a simple clustering solution of word vectors. Cluster trees have long been used to improve the efficiency of nearest neighbour retrieval but analogy completion has some additional structure due to the use of analogy completion formulas.We evaluate several configurations of word embedding clusters. Due to its relationship to tasks such as link prediction and knowledge base completion we believe that these results may be of interest to a wider group of people.},

abstract = {When building a large inverted file index on a system with effectively unlimited memory, performance may be constrained by RAM latency. To optimise speed requires an understanding of the non-uniform memory access characteristics of modern systems. We address three main techniques for improving the performance of an in-memory, list-based inverted file indexer: List chunking, in-chunk postings compression, and use of virtual memory "Large Pages". We compare performance of dynamic chunking schemes capable of adapting to the Zipf-like distribution of term frequencies. Using a data set with 8.5 billion word occurrences, we find that the techniques are cumulative. Chunking almost halves the memory required for linked lists, while dramatically reducing the number of cache-line reads required to traverse the lists; In-chunk compression further halves the memory footprint, though it does not make much difference to speed; Large pages reduce the inefficiency of page table walks and speed up both phases of index building.},

abstract = {Query auto completion mechanisms assist users to formulate search requests by suggesting possible queries corresponding to incomplete text they have typed. Keystroke by keystroke, these mechanisms proceed by finding matching strings from resources such as logs that have captured the behavior of previous users; they might also be informed by key phrases extracted from indexed documents, including, for example, anchor-text strings. Here we explore the range of ways, or modes, in which strings might be thought of as "matching" a partially typed query, and hence develop a taxonomy of possible approaches, each requiring different implementation structures and algorithms. Past work in the field has typically focused on only one or another of the modes, creating a lack of clarity as to exactly what challenge is being addressed. We use our taxonomy to survey options for auto completion and provide preliminary measurements in regard to their computational cost, using a range of public implementations.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the annotation-based retrieval (AR) of World Wide Web (WWW) resources that has been annotated by users on Collaborative Tagging (CT) platforms as a form of user-generated content (UGC). Previous approaches have simply weight the WWW resources according to their popularity, in order to leverage on the inherent wisdom of the crowd (WotC). In this paper, we argue that the popularity alone is not a sufficient indicator of quality since (1) some users are better annotators than the others; (2) resource popularity can be easily inflated by malicious users; and (3) high quality but highly specific resources may exhibit lower popularity than more general ones. Thus, we investigate the indicators of information quality for WWW resources, particularly user annotations that can be used to describe them. This research estimates the user expertise of content annotators in order to infer the information quality of their contributions; by exploring the various signals available on social bookmarking platforms such as the temporal information of annotations. The evaluation in retrieval performance on social bookmarking data shows significant improvements with the estimated user expertise and inferred information quality.},

We show that careful integration of parallel traversal can improve both efficiency and effectiveness when compared with current single threaded early termination approaches. In addition, we explore the various trade-offs for differing early termination heuristics, and propose hybrid systems which parallelize long running queries, while processing short running queries with only a single thread.},

abstract = {Query Autocompletion (QAC) systems are interactive tools that assist a searcher in entering a query given a partial query prefix. Existing QAC research -- with a number of notable exceptions --relies upon large existing query logs from which to extract historical queries. These queries are then ordered by some ranking algorithm as candidate completions, given the query prefix. Given the numerous search environments (e.g. enterprises, personal or secured data repositories) in which large query logs are unavailable, the need for synthetic -- or generative -- QAC systems will become increasingly important. Generative QAC systems may be used to augment traditional query-based approaches, and/or entirely replace them in certain privacy sensitive applications. Even in commercial Web search engines, a significant proportion (up to 15%) of queries issued daily have never been seen previously, meaning there will always be opportunity to assist users in formulating queries which have not occurred historically. In this paper, we describe a system that can construct generative QAC suggestions within a user-acceptable timeframe (~58ms), and report on a series of experiments over three publicly available, large-scale question sets that investigate different aspects of the system's performance.},

The paper contributes: (1) a test collection investigating the identification of anchor text (entities) in patent link discovery, (2) a user experiment studying the selection of anchors by users, and (3) an evaluation of four popular unsupervised keyword ranking methods (TFIDF, BM25, Keyphraseness, Termex) to identify potential anchors to link.},

Here we use five rankers, 100 tasks, and 28,869 queries to distinguish these three effects over six pre-retrieval predictors. We see that task effects dominate those due to query or ranker; that many "query performance predictors" are in fact predicting task difficulty; and that this makes it difficult to use these algorithms.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been widely used for text classification. Both word-based CNNs and character-based CNNs have shown good performance for Twitter sentiment classification. Most research on CNNs is towards English Twitter sentiment analysis and language-independent sentiment classification is still a challenging task due to the lack of non-English resources. Recently there are several works using character-based CNNs for tackling the language-independence challenge. Motivated by the intuition that the word-level and character-level deep features contain complimentary information, we propose a hybrid word-character CNN for language-agnostic Twitter sentiment classification. Word-character CNN comprises two convolutional channels, one for word-level convolution and one for character-level convolution, and a merge layer is included in our model for combining features from two convolutional channels. Moreover, our model does not require language identification and do not use unsupervised embeddings or other external resources. Our proposed model can achieve more superior performance on language-agnostic Twitter sentiment classification than word-based CNNs and character-based CNNs.},
