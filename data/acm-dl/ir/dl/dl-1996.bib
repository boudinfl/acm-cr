abstract = {Music is traditionally retrieved by title, composer or subject
classification. It is possible, with current technology, to
retrieve music from a database on the basis of a few notes sung or
hummed into a microphone. This paper describes the implementation
of such a system, and discusses several issues pertaining to music
retrieval. We first describe an interface that transcribes acoustic
input into standard music notation. We then analyze string matching
requirements for ranked retrieval of music and present the results
of an experiment which tests how accurately people sing well known
melodies. The performance of several string matching criteria are
analyzed using two folk song databases. Finally, we describe a
prototype system which has been developed for retrieval of tunes
from acoustic input.},

abstract = {The goal of the VISION (Video Indexing for SearchIng Over Networks)
project is to establish a comprehensive, online digital video
library. We are developing automatic mechanisms to populate the
library and provide content-based search and retrieval over
computer networks. The salient feature of our approach is the
integrated application of mature image or video processing,
information retrieval, speech feature extraction and word-spotting
technologies for efficient creation and exploration of the library
materials. First, full-motion video is captured in real-time with
flexible qualities to meet the requirements of library patrons
connected via a wide range of network bandwidths. Then, the videos
are automatically segmented into a number of logically meaningful
video clips by our novel two-step algorithm based on video and
audio contents. A closed caption decoder and/or word-spotter is
being incorporated into the system to extract textual information
to index the video clips by their contents. Finally, all
information is stored in a full-text information retrieval system
for content-baaed exploration of the library over networks of
varying bandwidths.},

abstract = {Often, publishers are reluctant to offer valuable digital documents
on the Internet for fear that they will be re-transmitted or copied
widely. A Copy Detection Mechanism can help identify such copying.
For example, publishers may register their documents with a copy
detection server, and the server can then automatically check
public sources such as UseNet articles and Web sites for potential
illegal copies. The server can search for exact copies, and also
for cases where significant portions of documents have been copied.
In this paper we study, for the first time, the performance of
various copy detection mechanisms, including the disk storage
requirements, main memory requirements, response times for
registration, and response time for querying. We also contrast
performance to the accuracy of the mechanisms (how well they detect
partial copies). The results are obtained using SCAM, an
experimental server we have implemented, and a collection of 50,000
netnews articles.},
