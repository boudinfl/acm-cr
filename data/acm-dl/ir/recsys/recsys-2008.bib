abstract = {User-based collaborative filtering methods typically predict a user's item ratings as a weighted average of the ratings given by similar users, where the weight is proportional to the user similarity. Therefore, the accuracy of user similarity is the key to the success of the recommendation, both for selecting neighborhoods and computing predictions. However, the computed similarities between users are somewhat inaccurate due to data sparsity.For a given user, the set of neighbors selected for predicting ratings on different items typically exhibit overlap. Thus, error terms contributing to rating predictions will tend to be shared, leading to correlation of the prediction errors.Through a set of case studies, we discovered that for a given user, the prediction errors on different items are correlated to the similarities of the corresponding items, and to the degree to which they share common neighbors.We propose a framework to improve prediction accuracy based on these statistical prediction errors. Two different strategies to estimate the prediction error on a desired item are proposed. Our experiments show that these approaches improve the prediction accuracy of standard user based methods significantly, and they outperform other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The paper studies the Long Tail problem of recommender systems when many items in the Long Tail have only few ratings, thus making it hard to use them in recommender systems. The approach presented in the paper splits the whole itemset into the head and the tail parts and clusters only the tail items. Then recommendations for the tail items are based on the ratings in these clusters and for the head items on the ratings of individual items. If such partition and clustering are done properly, we show that this reduces the recommendation error rates for the tail items, while maintaining reasonable computational performance.},

Our approach is based on so called Affinity Networks, and on a novel system, called MobHinter, that epidemically spreads recommendations through spontaneous similarities between users. Main results of our study are two fold: firstly, we show how to reach comparable recommendation accuracies in the mobile domain as well as in a complete knowledge scenario; secondly, we propose epidemic collaborative strategies that can reduce rapidly and realistically the cold start problem.},

abstract = {Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.},

abstract = {Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy.},

We present empirical data from an experiment with 2,000 users of a social networking site during a one month period. Our findings suggest that users who receive recommendations create more entries and update them more over time. Further, using articulated social network information for recommendations performed better than content-based matching.},

abstract = {A new ontological-content-based method for ranking the relevancy of items in the electronic newspapers domain is proposed. The method is being implemented in ePaper, a personalized electronic newspaper research project. The content-based part of the filtering method of ePaper utilizes a hierarchical ontology of news items. The method considers common and "close" ontology concepts appearing in the user's profile and in the item's profile, measuring the hierarchical distance between concepts in the two profiles. Based on the number of common and related concepts, and their distances from each other, the filtering algorithm computes the similarity between items and users, and rank-orders the news items according to their relevancy to each user, thus providing a personalized newspaper.We have conducted evaluations of the filtering method, examining various parameters. A group of subjects, each having defined an initial content-based profile using the news ontology concepts, read news items from a certain electronic newspaper and expressed the relevancy of each item to them. In different runs of the algorithm on the same data, we changed several parameters of the algorithm, and compared the results with the users' ratings. We discovered that the filtering method, which considers not only common concepts but also hierarchically related concepts, yields significantly better quality of filtering compared to using only common concepts. Moreover, we were able to find optimal values of similarity scores according to the hierarchical distance between related concepts.},

Since its inception, a number of significant FIM algorithms have been developed to speed up mining performance. Unfortunately, when the dataset size is huge, both the memory use and computational cost can still be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose to parallelize the FP-Growth algorithm (we call our parallel algorithm PFP) on distributed machines. PFP partitions computation in such a way that each machine executes an independent group of mining tasks. Such partitioning eliminates computational dependencies between machines, and thereby communication between them. Through empirical study on a large dataset of 802,939 Web pages and 1,021,107 tags, we demonstrate that PFP can achieve virtually linear speedup. Besides scalability, the empirical study demonstrates that PFP to be promising for supporting query recommendation for search engines.},

abstract = {Critique-based conversational recommender systems are becoming common place, facilitating richer dialogues with the user than pure content-based or collaborative approaches. Most implementations of these systems combine similarity-based reasoning with constraints to enable users express preferences as critiques of products. Critiques are simple statements like "I like this product, but would prefer one that is less expensive". In this paper we exploit the fact that the repertoire of critiques available to the user is usually known ahead of interaction time to construct a critique graph representation of a catalogue. The critique graph provides a formal basis for reasoning about the set of products that can be reached using critiques from a given product. We introduce the concepts of product cover, support sets of products and catalogue cover. The latter is defined as a set of products from which all products in a catalogue can be reached using a specified best-case maximum number of critiques. We show that for the catalogues we considered, catalogue covers are typically small. We show that the sizes and distributions of product covers and support sets can be used to inform us of the structure of a catalogue and the challenges it would present for interactive navigation. We also propose the notion of a minimum catalogue cover as a set of "entry products" that ensure that all products in the catalogue can be reached by critiquing.},

abstract = {The primary premise upon which top-N recommender systems operate is that similar users are likely to have similar tastes with regard to their product choices. For this reason, recommender algorithms depend deeply on similarity metrics to build the recommendation lists for end-users.However, it has been noted that the products offered on recommendation lists are often too similar to each other and attention has been paid towards the goal of improving diversity to avoid monotonous recommendations.Noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we model the competing goals of maximizing the diversity of the retrieved list while maintaining adequate similarity to the user query as a binary optimization problem. We explore a solution strategy to this optimization problem by relaxing it to a trust-region problem.This leads to a parameterized eigenvalue problem whose solution is finally quantized to the required binary solution. We apply this approach to the top-N prediction problem, evaluate the system performance on the Movielens dataset and compare it with a standard item-based top-N algorithm. A new evaluation metric ItemNovelty is proposed in this work. Improvements on both diversity and accuracy are obtained compared to the benchmark algorithm.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering is one of the most widely used approaches in recommendation systems which predicts user preferences by learning past user-item relationships. In recent years, item-oriented collaborative filtering methods came into prominence as they are more scalable compared to user-oriented methods. Item-oriented methods discover item-item relationships from the training data and use these relations to compute predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel item-oriented algorithm, Random Walk Recommender, that first infers transition probabilities between items based on their similarities and models finite length random walks on the item space to compute predictions. This method is especially useful when training data is less than plentiful, namely when typical similarity measures fail to capture actual relationships between items. Aside from the proposed prediction algorithm, the final transition probability matrix computed in one of the intermediate steps can be used as an item similarity matrix in typical item-oriented approaches. Thus, this paper suggests a method to enhance similarity matrices under sparse data as well. Experiments on MovieLens data show that Random Walk Recommender algorithm outperforms two other item-oriented methods in different sparsity levels while having the best performance difference in sparse datasets.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) have become popular for their ability to make useful suggestions to online shoppers. Knowledge-based RS represent one branch of these types of applications that employ means-end knowledge to map abstract user requirements to product characteristics. Before setting up such a system, the knowledge has to be acquired from domain experts and formalized using constraints or a comparable representation mechanism. However, the initial acquisition of the knowledge base and its maintenance are effort intensive tasks. Here, we propose a system that learns rule-based preferences from successful interactions in historic transaction data. It is realized as a meta-level hybrid that employs collaborative filtering to derive preferences from a user's nearest neighbors that are processed by a knowledge-based RS to derive recommendations. An evaluation using a commercial dataset showed that this approach outperforms the prediction accuracy of a knowledge base provided by domain experts. In addition, the approach is applicable for supporting domain experts in the maintenance and validation tasks associated with providing personalization knowledge bases.},

Existing defenses based on analysis of ratings also discard useful information from honest raters. In this paper, we show that this is unavoidable and provide a lower bound on how much information must be discarded. We use an information-theoretic framework to exhibit a fundamental tradeoff between manipulation-resistance and optimal use of genuine ratings in recommender systems. We define a recommender system to be (n, c)-robust if an attacker with n sybil identities cannot cause more than a limited amount c units of damage to predictions. We prove that any robust recommender system must also discard Ω(log (n/c)) units of useful information from each genuine rater.},

However, e-commerce systems are also vulnerable in this respect because there are opportunities for sellers to gain advantage through manipulation of reputation and recommendation. One such vulnerability is the use of fraudulent user profiles to boost (or damage) the ratings of items in an online recommender system. In this paper we cast this problem as a problem of detecting anomalous structure in network analysis and propose a novel mechanism for detecting this anomalous structure. We present an evaluation that shows that this approach is effective at uncovering the types of recommender systems attack described in the literature.},

abstract = {Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags.In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one.},

Composite services are characterized by a set of sub-services, which, in turn, can be composite or atomic. Each atomic and composite service is associated with metrics, such as cost, duration, and enjoyment ranking. The framework is based on the Composite Recommender Knowledge Base, which is composed of views, including Service Metric Views that specify services and their metrics; Recommendation Views that specify the ranking definition to balance optimality and diversity; parametric Transformers that specify how service metrics are defined in terms of metrics of its subservices; and learning sets from which the unknown parameters in the transformers are iteratively learned. Also introduced in the paper is the top-k selection criterion that, based on a vector of utility metrics, provides the balance between the optimality of individual metrics and the diversity of recommendations. To exemplify the framework, specific views are developed for a travel package recommender system.},

The latter, user-centric evaluation, aims at measuring users' perceived quality of novel, previously unknown, recommendations.The results of the experiments, done in the music recommendation context, show that last.fm social recommender, based on collaborative filtering, is prone to popularity bias. This has direct consequences on the topology of the item-based recommendation network. Pure audio content-based methods (CB) are not affected by popularity. However, a user-centric experiment done with 288 subjects shows that even though a social-based approach recommends less novel items than our CB, users' perceived quality is better than those recommended by a pure CB method.},

We conducted a field experiment in MovieLens where we imposed additional work on new users: not only did they have to rate movies, they also had to enter varying numbers of tags. While requiring more work led to fewer users completing the entry process, the benefits were significant: the remaining users produced a large volume of tags initially, and continued to enter tags at a much higher rate than a control group. Further, their rating behavior was not depressed. Our results suggest that careful design of the initial user experience can lead to significant benefits for an online community.},

The input parameters of a flexible recommendation process comprise the "knobs" that control the final output and hence generate flexible recommendations. We describe how flexible recommendations can be expressed over a relational database and we present our prototype system that allows defining and executing different, fully-parameterized, recommendation workflows over relational data.

abstract = {Recommender systems, based on collaborative filtering, draw their strength from techniques that manipulate a set of user-rating profiles in order to compute predicted ratings of unrated items. There are a wide range of techniques that can be applied to this problem; however, the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm has become the dominant method used in this context. Much research to date has focused on improving the performance of this algorithm, without considering the properties that emerge from manipulating the user data in this way. In order to understand the effect of kNN on a user-rating dataset, the algorithm can be viewed as a process that generates a graph, where nodes are users and edges connect similar users: the algorithm generates an implicit social network amongst the system subscribers. Temporal updates of the recommender system will impose changes on the graph. In this work we analyse user-user kNN graphs from a temporal perspective, retrieving characteristics such as dataset growth, the evolution of similarity between pairs of users, the volatility of user neighbourhoods over time, and emergent properties of the entire graph as the algorithm parameters change. These insights explain why certain kNN parameters and similarity measures outperform others, and show that there is a surprising degree of structural similarity between these graphs and explicit user social networks.},

One of the major drawbacks of matrix factorization is that once computed, the model is static. For real-world applications dynamic updating a model is one of the most important tasks. Especially when ratings on new users or new items come in, updating the feature matrices is crucial.In this paper, we generalize regularized matrix factorization (RMF) to regularized kernel matrix factorization (RKMF). Kernels provide a flexible method for deriving new matrix factorization methods. Furthermore with kernels nonlinear interactions between feature vectors are possible. We propose a generic method for learning RKMF models. From this method we derive an online-update algorithm for RKMF models that allows to solve the new-user/new-item problem. Our evaluation indicates that our proposed online-update methods are accurate in approximating a full retrain of a RKMF model while the runtime of online-updating is in the range of milliseconds even for huge datasets like Netflix.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies.},

Two major approaches for this problem are matrix factorization (MF) and the neighbor based approach (NB). In this work, we propose various variants of MF and NB that can boost the performance of the usual ensemble based scheme. First, we investigate various regularization scenarios for MF. Second, we introduce two NB methods: one is based on correlation coefficients and the other on linear least squares. At the experimentation part, we show that the proposed approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time.

abstract = {We present a flexible approach to collaborative filtering which stems from basic research results. The approach is flexible in several dimensions: We introduce an algorithm where the loss can be tailored to a particular recommender problem. This allows us to optimize the prediction quality in a way that matters for the specific recommender system. The introduced algorithm can deal with structured estimation of the predictions for one user. The most prominent outcome of this is the ability of learning to rank items along user preferences. To this end, we also present a novel algorithm to compute the ordinal loss in O(n log(n)) as apposed to O(n2). We extend this basic model such that it can accommodate user and item offsets as well as user and item features if they are present. The latter unifies collaborative filtering with content based filtering. We present an analysis of the algorithm which shows desirable properties in terms of privacy needs of users, parallelization of the algorithm as well as collaborative filtering as a service. We evaluate the algorithm on data provided by WikiLens. This data is a cross-domain data set as it contains ratings on items from a vast array of categories. Evaluation shows that cross-domain prediction is possible.},

abstract = {Search engines are among the most-used resources on the internet. However, even today's most successful search engines struggle to provide high quality search results. According to recent studies as many as 50 percent of web search sessions fail to find any relevant results for the searcher. Researchers have proposed social search techniques, in which early searchers provide feedback that is used to improve relevance for later searchers. In this paper we investigate foundational questions of social search. In particular, we directly assess the degree of agreement among users about the relevance ranking of search results. We developed a simulated search engine interface that systematically randomizes Google's normal relevance ordering of the items presented to users. Our results show that (a) people are biased toward items in the top of the search lists, even if the list is randomized; (b) people explicit feedback is not biased and (c) people's shared preferences do not always agree with Google's result order. These results suggest that social search techniques might improve the effectiveness of web search engines.},

However, there is little, if any, direct evidence in the literature of the value of recommender systems to e-Businesses, especially relating to consumer packaged goods (CPG) sold in a supermarket setting. We have been working in collaboration with LeShop (www.LeShop.ch), to gather real evidence of the added business value of a personalised recommender system. In this paper, we present our initial evaluation of the performance of our model-based personalised recommender systems over the 21-month period from May 2006 to January 2008, with particular focus on the added-value to the business. Our analysis covers shopper penetration, as well as the direct and indirect extra revenue generated by our recommender systems. One of the key lessons we have learnt during this case study is that the effect of a recommender system extends far beyond the direct extra revenue generated from the purchase of recommended items. The importance of maintaining updated model files was also found to be key to maintaining the performance of such model-based systems.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems help an on-line user to tame information overload and are being used now in complex domains where it could be beneficial to exploit context-awareness, e.g., in travel recommendation. Technically, in Recommender Systems we can interpret context as a set of constraints or preferences over the usage of items determined by the contextual conditions (e.g., today it is raining or the user is in a particular location). In fact, there is a lack of approaches to deal effectively with contextual data. This thesis investigates some approaches to exploit context in Recommender Systems. It provides a general architecture of context-aware Recommender Systems and analyzes separate components of this model. The main focus is to investigate new approaches that can bring a real added value to users. In this paper I also describe my initial results on item selection and item weighting for context-dependent Collaborative Filtering (CF). Moreover, I shall present my ongoing research on CF hybridization using context.},

These challenges can be addressed by automating several of the management activities of a Web site. In this work we propose to develop a platform that can be used for that purpose, which is independent of the Web site. We started by developing a data warehouse that stores data about the usage, content and structure of a Web site. We have also developed a tool that uses the data in the data warehouse and provides information to the editor to monitor the activity on the Web site as well as the site itself. We have recently begun to develop multidimensional recommender systems that take advantage of the wealth of the data in the data warehouse. Both simulated and live tests are carried out to test the platform.},

Learning Networks can be filled with lots of learning activities stemming from different providers. Such networks are dynamic, because each member could add or delete content at any time. A personal recommender system is needed to support learners in selecting learning activities from a Learning Network that will enable them to achieve their learning goals in a specific domain.It is expected that such support will minimize the amount of time learners need for finding suitable learning activities. A better alignment of the characteristics of learners and learning activities is expected to increase both effectiveness and efficiency of learning progress of the learners.},

We empirically demonstrate how these approaches work with several recommendation techniques, increasing the accuracy of recommendations. We also show how these approaches can generate more personalized recommendations, as measured by the diversity metric. As a result, users can be given a better control to choose whether to receive recommendations with higher accuracy or higher diversity.},

abstract = {Internet users often face the challenge of identifying the most suitable product out of some product assortment available on a certain e-sales platform. Recommender systems can substantially alleviate this typically complex task. Since the rise of such systems a lot of effort has been done in developing different recommendation approaches and algorithms, which all of them have certain strengths and weaknesses. What has been widely ignored by the recommender community so far are the potentials and impacts of psychological and decision theoretical phenomenons, which already have been investigated and applied in the field of marketing. Such phenomenons promise big capability to support users in decision making when facing a comparison situation. This paper concentrates on two classes of phenomenons, which are decoy effects and serial position effects. Tightly coupled to these phenomenons is the problem of getting the utility function of a recommender right, as this function serves both as the basis of result set calculation as well as the fundament of exploitation of above mentioned phenomenons. Putting all these aspects together an extended architecture for recommender systems will be proposed in the end of the paper.},
