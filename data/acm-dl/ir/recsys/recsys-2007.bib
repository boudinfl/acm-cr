abstract = {Collaborative filtering has become an established method to measure users' similarity and to make predictions about their interests. However, prediction accuracy comes at the cost of user's privacy: in order to derive accurate similarity measures, users are required to share their rating history with each other. In this work we propose a new measure of similarity, which achieves comparable prediction accuracy to the Pearson correlation coefficient, and that can successfully be estimated without breaking users' privacy. This novel method works by estimating the number of concordant, discordant and tied pairs of ratings between two users with respect to a shared random set of ratings. In doing so, neither the items rated nor the ratings themselves are disclosed, thus achieving strictly-private collaborative filtering. The technique has been evaluated using the recently released Netflix prize dataset.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a powerful technique for generating personalized predictions. CF systems are typically based on a central storage of user profiles used for generating the recommendations. However, such centralized storage introduces a severe privacy breach, since the profiles may be accessed for purposes, possibly malicious, not related to the recommendation process. Recent researches proposed to protect the privacy of CF by distributing the profiles between multiple repositories and exchange only a subset of the profile data, which is useful for the recommendation. This work investigates how a decentralized distributed storage of user profiles combined with data modification techniques may mitigate some privacy issues. Results of experimental evaluation show that parts of the user profiles can be modified without hampering the accuracy of CF predictions. The experiments also indicate which parts of the user profiles are most useful for generating accurate CF predictions, while their exposure still keeps the essential privacy of the users.},

However due to data sparsity of the input ratings matrix, the step of finding similar users often fails. We propose to replace this step with the use of a trust metric, an algorithm able to propagate trust over the trust network and to estimate a trust weight that can be used in place of the similarity weight. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings.},

abstract = {User data scarcity has always been indicated among the major problems of collaborative filtering recommender systems. That is, if two users do not share sufficiently large set of items for whom their ratings are known, then the user-to-user similarity computation is not reliable and a rating prediction for one user can not be based on the ratings of the other. This paper shows that this problem can be solved, and that the accuracy of collaborative recommendations can be improved by: a) partitioning the collaborative user data into specialized and distributed repositories, and b) aggregating information coming from these repositories. This paper explores a content-dependent partitioning of collaborative movie ratings, where the ratings are partitioned according to the genre of the movie and presents an evaluation of four aggregation approaches. The evaluation demonstrates that the aggregation improves the accuracy of a centralized system containing the same ratings and proves the feasibility and advantages of a distributed collaborative filtering scenario.},

abstract = {This article presents an approach to automatically create virtual communities of users with similar music preferences in a distributed system. Our goal is to create personalized music channels for these communities using the content shared by its members in peer-to-peer networks for each community. To extract these communities a complex network theoretic approach is chosen. A fully connected graph of users is created using epidemic protocols. We show that the created graph sufficiently converges to a graph created with a centralized algorithm after a small number of protocol iterations. To find suitable techniques for creating user communities, we analyze graphs created from real-world recommender datasets and identify specific properties of these datasets. Based on these properties, different graph-based community-extraction techniques are chosen and evaluated. We select a technique that exploits identified properties to create clusters of music listeners. The suitability of this technique is validated using a music dataset and two large movie datasets. On a graph of 6,040 peers, the selected technique assigns at least 85% of the peers to optimal communities, and obtains a mean classification error of less than 0.05% over the remaining peers that are not assigned to the best community.},

abstract = {The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit.Robust statistics is an area within statistics where estimation methods have been developed that deteriorate more gracefully in the presence of unmodeled noise and slight departures from modeling assumptions. In this work, we study how such robust statistical methods, in particular M-estimators, can be used to generate stable recommendation even in the presence of noise and spam. To that extent, we present a Robust Matrix Factorization algorithm and study its stability. We conclude that M-estimators do not add significant stability to recommendation; however the presented algorithm can outperform existing recommendation algorithms in its recommendation quality.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach for building online recommender systems. The fundamental process of the CF approach is to predict how a user would like to rate a given item based on the ratings of some nearest-neighbor users (user-based CF) or nearest-neighbor items (item-based CF). In the user-based CF approach, for example, the conventional prediction procedure is to find some nearest-neighbor users of the active user who have rated the given item, and then aggregate their rating information to predict the rating for the given item. In reality, due to the data sparseness, we have observed that a large proportion of users are filtered out because they don't rate the given item, even though they are very close to the active user. In this paper we present a recursive prediction algorithm, which allows those nearest-neighbor users to join the prediction process even if they have not rated the given item. In our approach, if a required rating value is not provided explicitly by the user, we predict it recursively and then integrate it into the prediction process. We study various strategies of selecting nearest-neighbor users for this recursive process. Our experiments show that the recursive prediction algorithm is a promising technique for improving the prediction accuracy for collaborative filtering recommender systems.},

We show how an advisor can: observe the user's actions; infer constraints on the user's utility function and add them to a user model; use the constraints to deduce which queries the user is likely to try next; and advise the user to avoid those that are unsatisfiable. We call this information recommendation. We give a detailed formulation of information recommendation for the case of products that are described by a set of Boolean features. Our experimental results show that if the user is given advice, the number of queries she needs to try before finding the product of highest utility is greatly reduced. We also show that an advisor that confines its advice to queries that the user model predicts are likely to be tried next will give shorter advice than one whose advice is unconstrained by the user model.},

These recommenders learn a user profile, based on rating feedback from the user on, e.g., books, songs, or TV programs, and use machine learning techniques to infer the ratings of new items.The techniques commonly used are collaborative filtering and naive Bayesian classification, and they are known to have several problems, in particular the cold-start problem and its slow adaptivity to changing user preferences. These problems can be mitigated by allowing the user to set up or manipulate his profile.In this paper, we propose an extension to the naive Bayesian classifier that enhances user control. We do this by maintaining and flexibly integrating two profiles for a user, one learned by rating feedback, and one created by the user. We in particular show how the cold-start problem is mitigated.},

In this paper, we present an innovative simulation methodology and its use in the comparison of different user-query representation approaches. Our simulation test procedure replays off-line, against different system variants, interactions recorded in the live-user evaluation.

In order to provide personalized recommendations, recommender systems need to collect information about user preferences. Since users are reluctant to invest much time in explicitly expressing their interests, preferences often need to be implicitly inferred through data gathered by monitoring user behavior. Which is, alas, less reliable.This article addresses the problem of learning TV preferences based on tracking the programs users have watched, whilst dealing with the varying degrees of reliability in such information. Three approaches to the problem are discussed: use all information equally; weight information by its reliability or simply discard the most unreliable information.Experimental results for these three approaches are presented and compared using a content-based filtering recommender built on a Na\"{\i}ve Bayes classifier.},

abstract = {Information overload is no longer news; the explosive growth of the Internet has made this issue increasingly serious for Web users. Users are very often overwhelmed by the huge amount of information and are faced with a big challenge to find the most relevant information in the right time. Recommender systems aim at pruning this information space and directing users toward the items that best meet their needs and interests. Web Recommendation has been an active application area in Web Mining and Machine Learning research. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning perspective toward the problem, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike other recommender systems, our system does not use the static patterns discovered from web usage data, instead it learns to make recommendations as the actions it performs in each situation. We model the problem as Q-Learning while employing concepts and techniques commonly applied in the web usage mining domain. We propose that the reinforcement learning paradigm provides an appropriate model for the recommendation problem, as well as a framework in which the system constantly interacts with the user and learns from her behavior. Our experimental evaluations support our claims and demonstrate how this approach can improve the quality of web recommendations.},

In this paper, classical new user cold start techniques are improved by exploiting the cold user data, i.e. the user data that is readily available (e.g. age, occupation, location, etc.), in order to automatically associate the new user with a better first profile. Relying on the existing α-community spaces model, a rule-based induction process is used and a recommendation process based on the "level of agreement" principle is defined. The experiments show that the quality of recommendations compares to that obtained after a classical new user technique, while the new user effort is smaller as no initial ratings are asked.},

While there are different ways of approximating this conditional probability, the expression is generally taken to refer to the frequency of co-occurrence of items in the same basket, or other user-specific item lists, rather than being seen as the co-occurrence of χj with χi as a proportion of all other items bought alongside χi. This paper proposes a probabilistic calculus for the calculation of conditionals based on item rather than basket counts. The proposed method has the consequence that items bough together as part of small baskets are more predictive of each other than if they co-occur in large baskets. Empirical results suggests that this may result in better take-up of personalised recommendations.},

abstract = {We studied user behavior in a recommender-rich environment, Amazon online store, to see what role the algorithm-based and user-generated recommendations play in finding items of interest. We used applied ethnography, on-location interviewing and observation, to get an accurate picture of user activity. We were especially interested in the role of customer ratings and reviews and what kind of strategies users had developed for such an environment. Our results underline the need to develop recommender systems as a whole. The way the recommendations are shown affects which items get picked, and for improving the interface, it is necessary to study the whole in addition to studying the parts in isolation.},

abstract = {In order to learn a user's preferences in collaborative recommender systems it is crucial to select the most informative items for a user to rate. For example, rating a popular item will provide little discriminative information about user's preferences since most users like popular items. Existing approaches select the most informative items based primarily on items' uncertainty, but tend to ignore an important metric of coverage - the number of items for which we are able to accurately estimate preferences. Selecting an item based only on uncertainty will reduce the uncertainty of the selected item, but will not necessarily reduce the uncertainty of other items - which is the ultimate goal. Therefore, in order to reduce the uncertainty over all items, we propose to select items that are not only uncertain but are also influential. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.},

In this working paper we present Eigentaste 5.0, a constant-time recommender system that dynamically adapts the order that items are recommended by integrating user clustering with item clustering and monitoring item portfolio effects. This extends our Eigentaste 2.0 algorithm, which uses principal component analysis to cluster users offline. In preliminary experiments we backtested Eigentaste 5.0 on data collected from Jester, our online joke recommender system. Results suggest that it will perform better than Eigentaste 2.0. The new algorithm also uses item clusters to address the cold-start problem for introducing new items.},

For example, a user of the social music recommendation site last.fm might join the "First Wave Punk" group to discuss his or her favorite band (The Clash) and listen to playlists generated by fellow fans. Clustering techniques provide the potential to automatically discover groups of users who appear to share interests. We explore this idea by describing algorithms for clustering users of an online community and automatically describing the resulting user groups. We designed these techniques for use in an online recommendation system with no pre-existing group functionality, which led us to develop an "activity-balanced clustering" algorithm that considers both user activity and user interests in forming clusters.},

In this paper, we continue to investigate how to further reduce users' objective decision effort (e.g. time consumption) in such system by increasing the critique prediction accuracy of the system-proposed critiques. By means of real user evaluation, we proved that a new hybrid critiquing system design that integrates the preference-based recommendations organization technique for critiques suggestion can effectively help to increase the proposed critiques' application frequency and significantly contribute to saving users' task time and interaction effort.},

With KeepUP, we outline the design of a recommendation process that is based on an implicit social network where the relevancy and meaning of information can be negotiated not only with the recommender system but also with other users. Our overall goal is to support the formation and development of online communities of interest.},

Several of these systems offer capabilities for people to create profiles of themselves and algorithms for matching profiles to recommend one person to another. When a group of people is gathered together in a physical space, for the purpose of renewing connections or creating new ones, new challenges emerge with respect to which dimensions of people's online representations to inject into that space - how, where and when to recommend whom to whom.

Recommender systems help to overcome the information overflow and filter out irrelevant sources by comparing different types of information and selecting the best results in consideration of customer preferences. Therefore accurate customer profiles are necessary which nowadays do not exist. In a mobile environment customers are not willing to spend time on disclosing their preferences; maybe they are not aware of them or have difficulties to respond to system requests. The paper in hand follows recommendations by critiquing to improve profiling quality but instead of collecting information, the transparent communication of profile extensions is focused. The customer can add preferences to his profile without explicitly expressing. Furthermore, the connection between proposed preferences and the systems conclusion behind is visible.},

A social bookmarking and tagging tool, that is used in a multi-lingual and multi-cultural context of Europe, is introduced to teachers. We intend to use this information to create social information retrieval mechanisms that allow flexible access to large-scale collections of digital educational content.A first step towards studying the design and implementation of such systems is to understand more about tagging in multiple languages, its underlying data structures, and how multi-lingual tags and annotations can be leveraged for social information retrieval, such as for a recommender and a social navigation system. Thereafter, we plan to study their acceptance, use and usefulness.Moreover, our goal is to make the discovery of digital educational content more useful and efficient for teachers by studying the relationship between different information seeking tasks and retrieval methods. We believe that this can facilitate, support and enhance the everyday tasks of teachers and learners when interacting with digital content for education.},
