abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model for collaborative filtering applications. Our model is based on low-rank matrix factorization that uses a spatio-temporal filtering approach to estimate user and item factors. The spatial component regularizes the factors by exploiting correlation across users and/or items, modeled as a function of some implicit feedback (e.g., who rated what) and/or some side information (e.g., user demographics, browsing history). In particular, we incorporate correlation in factors through a Markov random field prior in a probabilistic framework, whereby the neighborhood weights are functions of user and item covariates. The temporal component ensures that the user/item factors adapt to process changes that occur through time and is implemented in a state space framework with fast estimation through Kalman filtering. Our spatio-temporal filtering (ST-KF hereafter) approach provides a single joint model to simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal structure in ratings and therefore provides an accurate method to predict future ratings. To ensure scalability of ST-KF, we employ a mean-field approximation for inference. Incorporating user/item covariates in estimating neighborhood weights also helps in dealing with both cold-start and warm-start problems seamlessly in a single unified modeling framework; covariates predict factors for new users and items through the neighborhood. We illustrate our method on simulated data, benchmark data and data obtained from a relatively new recommender system application arising in the context of Yahoo! Front Page.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are widely used in online e-commerce applications to improve user engagement and then to increase revenue. A key challenge for recommender systems is providing high quality recommendation to users in ``cold-start" situations. We consider three types of cold-start problems: 1) recommendation on existing items for new users; 2) recommendation on new items for existing users; 3) recommendation on new items for new users. We propose predictive feature-based regression models that leverage all available information of users and items, such as user demographic information and item content features, to tackle cold-start problems. The resulting algorithms scale efficiently as a linear function of the number of observations. We verify the usefulness of our approach in three cold-start settings on the MovieLens and EachMovie datasets, by comparing with five alternatives including random, most popular, segmented most popular, and two variations of Vibes affinity algorithm widely used at Yahoo! for recommendation.},

abstract = {Different buyers exhibit different purchasing behaviors. Some rush to purchase new products while others tend to be more cautious, waiting for reviews from people they trust. In market analysis, the former group of buyers is often referred to as innovators and early adopters while the latter group is referred to as laggards. The adoption behavior is a dynamic feature of the user and varies over groups of products, e.g., innovators of literature may not be the innovators of electronics. The adoption order of users is a dynamic feature of the product, which can help to predict the future potential buyers. However, such dynamic features are usually unavailable in the description of products. In this paper, we study the user behavior of an online review website- Epinions.com. We first propose to model user adoption behaviors by creating a total ordering among users who rate the products in a given category. We develop a greedy algorithm and a Markov-chain based algorithm for computing the category total ordering. Next, we show that by using user behavior information, we can more accurately predict the category of a new product as well as predict which users will follow. Furthermore, by using the Epinion.com trust network as evidence, we demonstrate that our total ordering can group users into communities that closely resemble the trust network. Thus the adoption order can be a useful feature in recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Previous work on using external aggregate rating information showed that this information can be incorporated in several different types of recommender systems and improves their performance. In this paper, we propose a more general class of methods that combine external aggregate information with individual ratings in a novel way. Unlike the previously proposed methods, one of the defining features of this approach is that it takes into the consideration not only the aggregate average ratings but also the variance of the aggregate distribution of ratings. The methods proposed in this paper estimate unknown ratings by finding an optimal linear combination of individual-level and aggregate-level rating estimators in a form of a hierarchical regression (HR) model that is grounded in the theory of statistics and machine learning.The proposed HR model is general enough so that the standard individual-level recommender systems and naive aggregate methods constitute special cases of this model.We show that for the general HR model, the presence of the aggregate variance, surprisingly, does not significantly improve estimation of unknown ratings vis-a-vis the case when only aggregate average ratings are considered.In the paper, we experimentally show that the optimal linear combination approach significantly dominates all other special cases, including the classical non-aggregated case and our previously studied aggregate methods, and therefore is the method of choice.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging applications have become a popular tool allowing Internet users to manage online resources with tags. Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets.},

abstract = {Tagging systems have become major infrastructures on the Web. They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reflect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources in order to improve search. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics to which new resources with only a few tags are mapped. Based on this, other tags belonging to a topic can be recommended for the new resource. Our evaluation shows that the approach achieves significantly better precision and recall than the use of association rules, suggested in previous work, and also recommends more specific tags. Moreover, extending resources with these recommended tags significantly improves search for new resources.},

abstract = {Besides the rating information, an increasing number of modern recommender systems also allow the users to add personalized tags to the items. Such tagging information may provide very useful information for item recommendation, because the users' interests in items can be implicitly reflected by the tags that they often use. Although some content-based recommender systems have made preliminary attempts recently to utilize tagging information to improve the recommendation performance, few recommender systems based on collaborative filtering (CF) have employed tagging information to help the item recommendation procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called tag informed collaborative filtering (TagiCoFi), to seamlessly integrate tagging information into the CF procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that TagiCoFi outperforms its counterpart which discards the tagging information even when it is available, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

It aims to help users to find the information they are looking for, and is usually based on the knowledge learned from past interactions with the search engine. In this paper we propose a new model for query suggestion, the Search Shortcut Problem, that consists in recommending "successful" queries that allowed other users to satisfy, in the past, similar information needs. This new model has several advantages with respect to traditional query suggestion approaches. First, it allows a straightforward evaluation of algorithms from available query log data. Moreover, it simplifies the application of several recommendation techniques from other domains. Particularly, in this work we applied Collaborative Filtering to this problem, and evaluated the interesting results achieved on large query logs from AOL and Microsoft. Different techniques for analyzing and extracting information from query logs, as well as new metrics and techniques for measuring the effectiveness of recommendations are proposed and evaluated. The results obtained clearly show the importance of several of our contributions, and open an interesting field for future research.},

Our recommender system exploits external social media to produce people and profile entry recommendations for new users. We present results of a live user study, showing that users who received recommendations at sign-up created more social connections, contributed more content, and were on the whole more engaged with the system, contributing more without prompt and returning more often. We further show that recommendations for multiple content types yield significantly better results, in terms of user contribution and consumption; and that recommendations of more active users yield a higher return rate.},

We link CF and content-based filtering (CBF) by finding a linear transformation that transforms user or item descriptions so that they are as close as possible to the feature vectors generated by MF for CF. We propose methods for explicit feedback that are able to handle 140,000 features when feature vectors are very sparse. With movie metadata collected for the NP movies we show that the prediction performance of the methods is comparable to that of CF, and can be used to predict user preferences on new movies. We also investigate the value of movie metadata compared to movie ratings in regards of predictive power. We compare our solely CBF approach with a simple baseline rating-based predictor. We show that even 10 ratings of a new movie are more valuable than its metadata for predicting user ratings.},

We investigate a new decision criterion, setwise minimax regret (SMR), for constructing optimal recommendation sets: we develop algorithms for computing SMR, and prove that SMR determines choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal. This provides a natural basis for generating compound critiques in conversational recommender systems. Our simulation results suggest that this utility-theoretically sound approach to user modeling allows much more effective navigation of a product space than traditional approaches based on, for example, heuristic utility models and product similarity measures.},

In our system, component engines are level-1 predictors, and a level-2 predictor is learned to generate the final prediction of the hybrid system. The input features of the level-2 predictor are predictions from component engines and the runtime metrics. Experimental results show that our system outperforms each single component engine as well as a static hybrid system.

Conversely, collaborative filtering techniques often provide accurate recommendations, but fail on cold start items. Hybrid schemes attempt to combine these different kinds of information to yield better recommendations across the board.We describe unified Boltzmann machines, which are probabilistic models that combine collaborative and content information in a coherent manner. They encode collaborative and content information as features, and then learn weights that reflect how well each feature predicts user actions. In doing so, information of different types is automatically weighted, without the need for careful engineering of features or for post-hoc hybridization of distinct recommender systems.We present empirical results in the movie and shopping domains showing that unified Boltzmann machines can be used to combine content and collaborative information to yield results that are competitive with collaborative techniques in recommending items that have been seen before, and also effective at recommending cold-start items.},

abstract = {An approach to user-based collaborative filtering is proposed that refines prediction of item ratings that is based on global user similarity by incorporating information derived from a more detailed user comparison made on the basis of Rated Item Pools (RIPs). The preference spectrum defined by items that a user has rated, and ranging from best-liked to most disliked items, is divided into item sets, or RIPs, which supply the basis for a fine-grained calculation of similarity between users. The RIP-based approach makes it possible for the model to take advantage of user tastes that are matched at one end of the spectrum, e.g., two users agree on favorites, without requiring complete correspondence of item ratings between user profiles. The approach improves rating prediction, as compared to a baseline that uses the global user similarity alone. It does not unduly inflate computational complexity or rely on external resources, common shortcomings of competing rating prediction methods. Cases in which the nearest neighbors are relatively dissimilar, known to be challenging for user-based collaborative filtering, demonstrate particularly substantial improvement. Performance is shown to be stable across the choice of neighborhood size, number of pools and relative pool size.},

Detection of more module mentions in conversations dramatically improved the quality of recommendations, even though the detection algorithm then had more false positives. Recommendations based on conversation co-mention were more effective than those based on co-installation, because co-installation data only led to recommendations of complementary modules and not substitutes. Recommendations based on co-mention were more effective than those based on text similarity matching for navigating from the most popular modules, but less effective than text matching for less popular modules.},

A number of attack models have been proposed and studied and recent work has suggested that model-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have greater robustness against these attacks. Moreover, to combat such attacks, several attack detection algorithms have been proposed. One that has shown high detection accuracy is based on using principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster attack profiles on the basis that such profiles are highly correlated. In this paper, we argue that the robustness observed in model-based algorithms is due to the fact that the proposed attacks have not targeted the specific vulnerabilities of these algorithms. We discuss how an effective attack targeting model-based algorithms that employ profile clustering can be designed. It transpires that the attack profiles employed in this attack, exhibit low rather than high pair-wise similarities and can easily be obfuscated to avoid PCA-based detection, while remaining effective.},

abstract = {It has been shown in recent years that effective profile injection or shilling attacks can be mounted on standard recommendation algorithms. These attacks consist of the insertion of bogus user profiles into the system database in order to manipulate the recommendation output, for example to promote or demote the predicted ratings for a particular product. A number of attack models have been proposed and some detection strategies to identify these attacks have been empirically evaluated. In this paper we show that the standard attack models can be readily detected using statistical detection techniques. We argue that insufficient consideration of the effectiveness of attacks under a constraint of statistical invariance has been taken in past research. In fact, it is possible to create effective attacks that are undetectable using the detection strategies proposed to date, including the PCA-based clustering strategy which has shown excellent performance against standard attacks. Nevertheless, these more advanced attacks can also be detected with careful design of a statistical detector. The question posed for future research is whether attack models that produce effective attack profiles that are statistically identical to genuine profiles are really possible.},

abstract = {In recommender systems, usually, a central server needs to have access to users' profiles in order to generate useful recommendations. Having this access, however, undermines the users' privacy.The more information is revealed to the server on the user-item relations, the lower the users' privacy is. Yet, hiding part of the profiles to increase the privacy comes at the cost of recommendation accuracy or difficulty of implementing the method. In this paper, we propose a distributed mechanism for users to augment their profiles in a way that obfuscates the user-item connection to an untrusted server, with minimum loss on the accuracy of the recommender system. We rely on the central server to generate the recommendations. However, each user stores his profile offline, modifies it by partly merging it with the profile of similar users through direct contact with them, and only then periodically uploads his profile to the server. We propose a metric to measure privacy at the system level, using graph matching concepts. Applying our method to the Netflix prize dataset, we show the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy in recommender systems in an applicable way.},

abstract = {A common approach to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of asking users to explicitly rate items in order to collect feedback about their preferences. However, users have been shown to be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings.In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items.},

Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems which can predict ratings for a given user and item. Collaborative filtering can be extended for top-N recommendation, but this approach does not work accurately for cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In this paper we propose novel methods exploiting a trust network to improve the quality of top-N recommendation. The first method performs a random walk on the trust network, considering the similarity of users in its termination condition. The second method combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach. Our experimental evaluation on the Epinions dataset demonstrates that approaches using a trust network clearly outperform the collaborative filtering approach in terms of recall, in particular for cold start users.},

abstract = {With the exponential growth of Web contents, Recommender System has become indispensable for discovering new information that might interest Web users. Despite their success in the industry, traditional recommender systems suffer from several problems. First, the sparseness of the user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems. (2) In terms of the trust relations, distinct from previous trust-aware recommender systems which are based on some heuristics, we systematically interpret how to constrain the objective function with trust regularization. (3) The experimental results show that the distrust relations among users are as important as the trust relations. The complexity analysis shows our method scales linearly with the number of observations, while the empirical analysis on a large Epinions dataset proves that our approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

In analogy to some personalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics. In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical validation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the performance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative filtering.},

Therefore, we believe that if users accepted rating-based recommenders, they are most likely to accept personality-based recommenders and personality-based recommenders have a high likelihood to be widely adopted despite the fact that rating-based recommenders are now the industry norm.

abstract = {Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.},

abstract = {Short search engine queries do not provide contextual information, making it difficult for traditional search engines to understand what users are really requesting. One approach to this problem is to use recommender systems that identify user interests through various methods in order to provide information specific to the user's needs. However, many current recommender systems use a collaborative model based on a network of users to provide the recommendations, leading to problems in environments where network relationships are sparse or unknown. Content-based recommenders can avoid the sparsity problem but they may be inefficient for large document collections. In this paper, we propose a concept-based recommender system that recommends papers to general users of the CiteSeerx digital library of Computer Science research publications. We also represent a novel way of classifying documents and creating user profiles based on the ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) classification tree. Based on these user profiles which are built using past click histories, relevant papers in the domain are recommended to users. Experiments with a set of users on the CiteSeerX database show that our concept-based method provides accurate recommendations even with limited user profile histories.},

This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting. In this approach, the ratings of certain items are split, according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition. Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one. We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings.},

abstract = {Critiquing-based recommenders do not require users to state all of their preferences upfront or rate a set of previously experienced products. Compared to other types of recommenders, they require relatively little user effort, especially initially, despite potential accuracy problems. On the other hand, they rely on a set of critiques to elicit users feedback in order to improve accuracy. Thus the better the critiques are, the more accurately and efficiently the system becomes in generating its recommendations. This method has been successfully applied to high-involvement products. However, it was never tested on public taste products such as music, films, perfumes, fashion goods or wine. Indeed our initial trial adapting traditional critiquing methods to this new domain led to unsatisfactory results. This has motivated us to develop a novel approach named "editorial picked critiques" (EPC) that accounts for users' needs for popularity information, editorial suggestions, as well as their needs for personalization and diversity. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate that EPC presents a viable recommender approach and is superior on several dimensions to critiques generated by data mining methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we present Donation Dashboard, a system that recommends non-profit organizations to users in the form of a portfolio of donation amounts. Recommendations are made using our Eigentaste 2.0 constant-time collaborative filtering algorithm in combination with a new method for generating a weighted portfolio of recommendations. The key challenge is to generate a customized portfolio that does not necessarily exclude items already rated by the user. Under our method, the weights for items in the portfolio that have not yet been rated by the user are normalized factors of their predicted ratings, and the weights for items previously rated by the user are normalized factors of the actual ratings. Donation Dashboard 1.0 launched in April 2008, and as of May 8 2009 we have collected over 59,000 ratings of 70 nonprofit organizations from over 3,800 users.In this working paper we describe our experience developing Donation Dashboard, including the design of the system and our new method for portfolio generation. We use Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) to measure the accuracy of Eigentaste using our dataset of non-profit organization ratings and we compare that with the global mean algorithm. We analyze the data collected since the launch of the site, and we have made our dataset available to the public.

Predicting the ratings can be formulated as a regression problem. Ensemble regression methods are effective tools that improve the results of simple regression algorithms by iteratively applying the simple algorithm to a diverse set of inputs. The present paper describes a simple and effective ensemble regressor for the prediction of missing ratings in recommender systems. The ensemble method is an adaptation of the AdaBoost regression algorithm for recommendation tasks. In all iterations, interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors are simultaneously derived by minimizing the root mean squared error. From iteration to iteration instances that are hard to predict are reinforced by manipulating their weights in the goal function that needs to be minimized. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the ensemble methodology significantly improves the predictive performance of single neighborhood-based collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {With the advent of online social networks, the trust-based approach to recommendation has emerged which exploits the trust network among users and makes recommendations based on the ratings of trusted users in the network. In this paper, we introduce a two dimensional trust model which dynamically gets updated based on users's feedbacks, in contrast to static trust values in current trust models. Explorability measures the extent to which a user can rely on recommendations returned by the social network of a trusted user. Dependability represents the extent to which a user's own ratings can be trusted by users trusting him directly and indirectly. We propose a method to learn the values of explorability and dependability from raw trust data and feedback expressed by users on the recommendations they receive. Positive feedback will increase the trust and negative feedback will decrease the trust among users. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset, demonstrating that exploiting user feedback results in lower prediction error compared to existing trust-based and collaborative filtering approaches.},

This paper addresses two phenomena that emerge when CF algorithms perform NN search in high-dimensional spaces that are typical in CF applications. The first is similarity concentration and the second is the appearance of hubs (i.e. points which appear in $k$-NN lists of many other points). Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation we show that these phenomena are inherent properties of high-dimensional space, unrelated to other data properties like sparsity, and that they can impact CF algorithms by questioning the meaning and representativeness of discovered NNs. Moreover, we show that it is not easy to mitigate the phenomena using dimensionality reduction. Studying these phenomena aims to provide a better understanding of the limitations of memory-based CF and motivate the development of new algorithms that would overcome them.},

Second, iTag performs just as well when trained on a single user's blog as when trained on a large corpus of blogs. Thus, iTag can be deployed as a global, non-personalized tag recommendation system, or as a personalized tag recommender.

abstract = {Content-based recommender systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. The basic process consists of matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item).Common-sense and domain-specific knowledge may be useful to give some meaning to the content of items, thus helping to generate more informative features than "plain" attributes.The process of learning user profiles could also benefit from the infusion of exogenous knowledge or open source knowledge, with respect to the classical use of endogenous knowledge (extracted from the items themselves).The main contribution of this paper is a proposal for knowledge infusion into content-based recommender systems, which suggests a novel view of this type of systems, mostly oriented to content interpretation by way of the infused knowledge.The idea is to provide the system with the "linguistic" and "cultural" background knowledge that hopefully allows a more accurate content analysis than classic approaches based on words. A set of knowledge sources is modeled to create a memory of linguistic competencies and of more specific world "facts", that can be exploited to reason about content as well as to support the user profiling and recommendation processes.The modeled knowledge sources include a dictionary, Wikipedia, and content generated by users (i.e. tags provided on items), while the core of the reasoning component is a spreading activation algorithm.},

Typically, code recommender tools have been based on rather simple rule based systems while many of the recent advances in Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering have been largely focused on rating data. While many of these advances can be incorporated in the code recommendation setting this problem also brings considerable challenges of its own. In this paper, we extend state-of-the-art collaborative filtering technology, namely Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) to this interesting application domain and show how to deal with the challenges posed by this problem. To this end, we introduce two new loss functions to the MMMF model. While we focus on code recommendation in this paper, our contributions and the methodology we propose can be of use in almost any collaborative setting that can be represented as a binary interaction matrix. We evaluate the algorithm on real data drawn from the Eclipse Open Source Project. The results show a significant improvement over current rule-based approaches.},

Our prototype system MoviExplain is a movie recommender system that provides both accurate and justifiable recommendations.},

abstract = {To exploit the enormous potential of niche products, modern information systems must support users in exploring digital libraries and online catalogs. A straight-forward way of doing so is to support browsing the available items, which is in general realized by presenting a user the top-N recommendations for each item. However, recent research indicates that most of the niche products reside in the so-called Long Tail, and simple collaborative filtering-based recommender systems alone do not allow to explore these niche products. In this paper we show that it is not only a popularity problem related to the collaborative filtering approach that makes a portion of the elements of a digital library inaccessible via browsing, but also a consequence of the top N-recommendation approach itself.},

abstract = {Utility or preference elicitation is a critical component in many recommender and decision support systems. However, most frameworks for elicitation assume a predefined set of features (e.g., as derived from catalog descriptions) over which user preferences are expressed. Just as user preferences vary considerably, so too can the features over which they are most comfortable expressing these preferences. In this work, we consider preference elicitation in the presence of subjective or user-defined features. We treat the problem of learning a user's feature definition as one of concept learning, but whose goal is to learn only enough about the concept definition to enable a good decision to be made. This is complicated by the fact that user preferences are unknown. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t minimax regret in the presence of both utility and concept uncertainty; and develop several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of relevant concept and utility uncertainty. Computational experiments verify the efficacy of these strategies.},

Due to the paucity of preference data per reviewer or per paper (relative to other recommender systems applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to learn reviewer-paper preference models. Our models are evaluated not just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of end-assignment quality. Using a linear programming-based assignment optimization, we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to maximize the overall affinities of papers assigned to reviewers.

abstract = {Online stores offer an increasingly large set of products. Interactive decision aids are becoming indispensable tools assisting users as they search for an ideal product to purchase. For an e-commerce website, adopting the correct tools can affect its survival: effective product recommender tools are increasingly recognized by online stores as effective means to sell more products; on the other hand, sites that do not employ intelligent tools will not only see poor purchase volumes but also experience less traffic because consumers are more likely to return to a site employing recommender systems.This paper presents ongoing research in understanding the impact of various decision aids on users' interaction behaviors and their subjective perceptions of these aids. In the current experiment, we employed an eye tracker in an in-depth user study to understand the influence of recommenders on how users select items for the basket set. We collected more than 20,300 fixation data points in 3,648 areas of interest. Our studies show that while users still rely on product filtering tools, the use of recommenders is becoming more prominent in helping them construct the basket set and is monotonically increasing as time goes on.},

abstract = {A functional dependency is a logical relationship amongst the attributes that define a table of data. Specifically, a functional dependency holds when the values of a subset of the attributes in a dataset determine the values of one or more other attributes. Uncovering such dependencies is utilized in many domains, such as database design. We demonstrate that it can also be utilized in a recommendation context when datasets represent product catalogues. State-of-the-art approaches to discovering functional dependencies require a tabular representation of the data. However, product catalogues can sometimes be defined implicitly, for example, as a set of solutions to a combinatorial problem. Such combinatorial catalogues can have a very large number of products, thus making standard approaches to uncovering functional dependencies inapplicable. In this paper we present the first approach to computing functional dependencies over compiled knowledge representations which can often be small even for huge catalogues. In particular, we develop efficient algorithms that operate over decision diagrams, which allow us to handle catalogues that are out of reach for current approaches. We apply our algorithms to tabular and combinatorial benchmarks and detect a number of properties that could be considered as anomalies in product catalogues.},

While domain experts reported higher satisfaction and perceived usefulness with attribute-based PE (i.e., indicating preference levels for the domain-related attributes), novices preferred case-based PE (i.e., indicating the preference for specific examples, from which attribute-preferences can then be implicitly calculated). The paper discusses the decision-theoretical principles that are believed to lead to this distinction, as well as an experiment that provides substantial evidence for the hypothesis. Consequently, we introduce the idea of adapting the method of PE to users' domain knowledge on the fly using click stream data.},

The model has the added benefit of being resistant to manipulation by false ratings and sybil attacks.We test the model on comments in Opinion Space, a new online discussion tool that allows users to visualize where they stand with respect to other users in terms of their opinions on a set of controversial propositions.

abstract = {In recent years it has been argued that, besides the standard accuracy metrics, other characteristics of the recommendation algorithm ought to be taken into account when evaluating recommendation performance. One such characteristic is recommendation diversity and this topic is the focus of this research project. The overall goal of the project is to examine ways to improve the diversity of recommendations while maintaining high accuracy. During the course of my work to date I have addressed the question of how best to evaluate diversification strategies and have proposed a number of new diversity enhancement algorithms.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates application of clustering to multi-criteria ratings as a method of improving the precision of top-N recommendations. With the advent of ecommerce sites that allow multi-criteria rating of items, there is an opportunity for recommender systems to use the additional information to gain a better understanding of user preference. This thesis proposes the use of the relevant set correlation model for a clustering-based collaborative filtering system. It is anticipated this novel system will handle large numbers of users and items without sacrificing the relevance of recommended items.},

abstract = {This work addresses a particular kind of cross domain personalization task consisting of selecting simultaneously two items in two different domains and recommending them together because they fit the user preferences and also they fit well together. In particular, it is shown that given a personalized recommendation for points of interests (POIs), the user's selection of POIs can be influenced by enriching their presentation with music tracks that are matching the user's profile and also the POIs. This paper presents the results of an online, live-users, experiment where we evaluated alternative approaches for matching POIs and music, based on tagging and text matching.},

abstract = {Knowledge-based recommender systems are applications that support users in the process of retrieving items from a complex product assortment (e.g. computers, holiday packages, and financial services). Recommendations are determined on the basis of explicitly defined user requirements which can be interpreted as constraints to be fulfilled by the items stored in a product table. If no solution (item) can be found, existing knowledge-based recommenders propose non-personalized query relaxations and repair actions for the given set of customer requirements that support a recovery from the dead-end. This paper points out how the usability of knowledge-based recommender systems can be improved by introducing the concept of personalized query relaxations and repair actions.},

abstract = {We present a knowledge-intensive and model-based case-based reasoning framework that supports the truster for situation-aware trust management. The suggested method augments the typically sparse trust information by inferring the missing information from other situational conditions, and can better support situation-aware trust management. Our framework can be coupled with existing trust management models to make them situation-aware. It uses the underlying model of trust management to transfer trust information between situations. We validate the proposed framework for Subjective Logic trust management model and evaluate it by conducting experiments on a large real dataset.},

abstract = {Nowadays, people have been increasingly interested in exploiting Web Search Engines (WSEs) not only for having access to simple Web pages, but mainly for accomplishing even complex activities, namely Web-mediated processes (or taskflows). Thus, users' information needs will become more complex, and Web search and recommender systems should change accordingly for dealing with this shift. We claim that such taskflows and their composing tasks are implicitly present in users' minds when they interact with a WSE to access the Web. Our first research challenge is thus to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, long-term log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associating meaningful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i.e., clusters of related queries) and taskflows. This large knowledge base constitutes a good starting point for building a model of users' behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs. Our system has to exploit the knowledge base of Web-mediated processes and the learned model of users' behaviors, to generate complex insights and task-based suggestions to incoming users while they interact with a WSE.},

abstract = {As the Web has shifted to an interactive environment where vast amounts of content is created by users, the question of whom to trust and what information to trust has become both more important and more difficult to answer. At the same time, social networks have become very popular with over a billion accounts shared across hundreds of networks. Social trust relationships, derived from social networks, are uniquely suited to speak to the quality of online information; recommender systems are designed to personalize, sort, aggregate, and highlight information. Merging social networks, trust, and recommender systems can improve the accuracy of recommendations and improve the user's experience. In this tutorial, we will cover the use of social trust in recommender systems. Topics including the computation of trust in social networks, integration of trust into recommender systems, and a discussion of when trust offers benefits and the challenges it presents.},
