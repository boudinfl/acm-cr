abstract = {George Stigler pioneered the economics of information in the 1960s with his observation that information is a scarce and valuable commodity. Stigler assumed people value information to the extent, and only to the extent, that it helps them to make better decisions, and that people update their beliefs rationally, in response to new information. Stigler won the Nobel prize for his contribution, as did three economists, George Akerlof, Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz ten years later. This second wave of research, that came to be called the "new economics of information" adhered to Stigler's assumptions, but examined consequences of asymmetric information -- i.e., the fact that interacting individuals often possess different information sets. In this talk I will discuss my research on four phenomena that are key to the information age that don't fit neatly into either wave of economic research on information: curiosity (the desire for information for its own sake), privacy (the desire to withhold information), information avoidance (a phenomenon that Stigler's theory explicitly ruled out), and the desire to share information. The last of these topics is most relevant to recommender systems, so I will devote special attention to it, discussing some of the fundamental motives that drive people to share information.},

abstract = {An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. Studies in the U.S. report that average six-year graduation rates across higher-education institutions is 59% and have remained relatively stable over the last 15 years. For those that do complete a college degree, less than half complete within four-years. Requiring additional terms or leaving college without receiving a bachelor's degree has high human and monetary costs and deprives students from the economic benefits of a college credential (over $1 million in a lifetime and even higher in STEM fields). Moreover, when students do not succeed in graduating, local and national communities struggle to create an educated workforce. Estimates indicate that by 2020 over 64% of the jobs in the U.S. will require at least some post-secondary education. These challenges have been recognized by the U.S. National Research Council, which identified that there is a critical need to develop innovative approaches to enable higher-education institutions retain students, ensure their timely graduation, and are well-trained and workforce ready in their field of study. Failure to do so represents a significant problem as it deprives the U.S. of the highly skilled workforce that it needs to successfully compete in the modern world.This talk describes various efforts under way to develop "Big Data" methods to analyze in a comprehensive manner, the large and diverse types of education and learning-related data in order to improve undergraduate education. These methods are motivated by and are designed to address various interrelated issues that have a significant impact on college student success and include: (i) academic pathways towards successful and timely graduation from the student perspective; (ii) effective pedagogy by instructors; and (iii) retention and persistence of students from the institutional and advisor perspective. In addition, the talk will discuss areas in which research methods and approaches originally developed by the recommender systems community can be applied to this domain.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are first and foremost about matching users with items the systems believe will delight them. The "main street" of personalization is thus about modeling users and items, and matching per user the items predicted to best satisfy the user. This holds for both collaborative filtering and content-based methods. In content discovery engines, difficulties arise from the fact that the content users natively consume on publisher sites does not necessarily match the sponsored content that drives the monetization and sustains those engines. The first part of this talk addresses this gap by sharing lessons learned and by discussing how the gap may be bridged at scale with proper techniques.The second part of the talk focuses on personalization of audiences on behalf of content marketing campaigns. From the marketers' side, optimizing audiences was traditionally done by refining targeting criteria, basically limiting the set of users to be exposed to their campaigns. Marketers then began sharing conversion data with systems, and the systems began optimizing campaign conversions by serving the campaign to users likely to transact with the marketer. Today, a hybrid approach of lookalike modeling combines marketers' targeting criteria with recommendation systems' models to personalize audiences for campaigns, with marketer ROI as the target.},

abstract = {The sparsity of users' preferences can significantly degrade the quality of recommendations in the collaborative filtering strategy. To account for the fact that the selections of social friends and foes may improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a learning to rank model that exploits users' trust and distrust relationships. Our learning to rank model focusses on the performance at the top of the list, with the recommended items that end-users will actually see. In our model, we try to push the relevant items of users and their friends at the top of the list, while ranking low those of their foes. Furthermore, we propose a weighting strategy to capture the correlations of users' preferences with friends' trust and foes' distrust degrees in two intermediate trust- and distrust-preference user latent spaces, respectively. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset show that the proposed learning to rank model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of sparsity in users' preferences and when a part of trust and distrust relationships is not available. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crucial role of our weighting strategy in our model, to balance well the influences of friends and foes on users' preferences.},

The most important challenge of applying metalearning on new problems is the development of useful measures able to characterize the data, i.e. metafeatures. We propose an extensive and exhaustive set of metafeatures to characterize Context-aware Filtering recommendation task. These metafeatures take advantage of the tensor's hierarchical structure via slice operations. The algorithm selection task is addressed as a Label Ranking problem, which ranks the Tensor Factorization algorithms according to their expected performance, rather than simply selecting the algorithm that is expected to obtain the best performance. A comprehensive experimental work is conducted on both levels, baselevel and metalevel (Tensor Factorization and Label Ranking, respectively). The results show that the proposed metafeatures lead to metamodels that tend to rank Tensor Factorization algorithms accurately and that the selected algorithms present high recommendation performance.},

abstract = {Recommending personalized content to users is a long-standing challenge to many online services including Facebook, Yahoo, Linkedin and Twitter. Traditional recommendation models such as latent factor models and feature-based models are usually trained for all users and optimize an "average" experience for them, yielding sub-optimal solutions. Although multi-task learning provides an opportunity to learn personalized models per user, learning algorithms are usually tailored to specific models (e.g., generalized linear model, matrix factorization and etc.), creating obstacles for a unified engineering interface, which is important for large Internet companies. In this paper, we present an empirical framework to learn user-specific personal models for content recommendation by utilizing gradient information from a global model. Our proposed method can potentially benefit any model that can be optimized through gradients, offering a lightweight yet generic alternative to conventional multi-task learning algorithms for user personalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by incorporating it in three popular machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, gradient boosting decision tree and matrix factorization. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the proposed framework can significantly improve the efficiency of personalized recommendation in real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graphs have proven to be extremely valuable to recommender systems, as they enable hybrid graph-based recommendation models encompassing both collaborative and content information. Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose entity2rec, a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendation. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming a number of state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality.},

Nevertheless, only a small number of students answer questions asked by their peers. This results in instructor overload, and many unanswered questions. To increase students' participation, we present an approach for recommendation of new questions to students who are likely to provide answers. Existing approaches to such question routing proposed for non-educational CQA systems tend to rely on a few experts, what is not applicable in educational domain where it is important to involve all kinds of students. In tackling this novel educational question routing problem, our method (1) goes beyond previous question-answering data as it incorporates additional non-QA data from the course (to improve prediction accuracy and to involve more of the student community) and (2) applies constraints on users' workload (to prevent user overloading). We use an ensemble classifier for predicting students' willingness to answer a question, as well as students' expertise for answering. We conducted an online evaluation of the proposed method using an A/B experiment in our CQA system deployed in edX MOOC. The proposed method outperformed a baseline method (non-educational question routing enhanced with workload restriction) by improving recommendation accuracy, keeping more community members active, and increasing an average number of their contributions.},

abstract = {Recommender systems nowadays have many applications and are of great economic benefit. Hence, it is imperative for success-oriented companies to compare various of such systems and select the better one for their purposes. To this end, various metrics of predictive accuracy are commonly used, such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or precision and recall. All these metrics more or less measure how well a recommender system can predict human behaviour. Unfortunately, human behaviour is always associated with some degree of uncertainty, making the evaluation difficult, since it is not clear whether a deviation is system-induced or just originates from the natural variability of human decision making. At this point, some authors speculated that we may be reaching some Magic Barrier where this variability prevents us from getting much more accurate [12, 13, 24]. In this article, we will extend the existing theory of the Magic Barrier [24] into a new probabilistic but a yet pragmatic model. In particular, we will use methods from metrology and physics to develop easy-to-handle quantities for computation to describe the Magic Barrier for different accuracy metrics and provide suggestions for common application. This discussion is substantiated by comprehensive experiments with real users and large-scale simulations on a high-performance cluster.},

Both systems use a one-dimensional, ordinal Rasch scale, which orders 79 energy-saving measures on their behavioral difficulty and link this to a user's energy-saving ability for tailored advice. We established that recommending Rasch-based advice can reduce a user's effort, increase system support and, in turn, increase choice satisfaction and lead to the adoption of more energy-saving measures. Moreover, follow-up surveys administered four weeks later point out that tailoring advice on its feasibility can support behavioral change.},

Yet explanations have been shown to improve the transparency of a recommender system by justifying recommendations, and this in turn can enhance the user's trust in the recommendations. Hence, one main challenge in designing a recommender system is mitigating the trade-off between an explainable technique with moderate prediction accuracy and a more accurate technique with no explainable recommendations. In this paper, we focus on factorization models and further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content or user attributes.

We perform a mixed model statistical analysis of user preferences for explanations in this system.

abstract = {Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of domains such as movies, music, news, products, restaurants, etc. While a typical recommender system bases its recommendations solely on users' preference data collected by the system itself, the quality of recommendations can significantly be improved if several recommender systems (or vendors) share their data. However, such data sharing poses significant privacy and security challenges, both to the vendors and the users. In this paper we propose secure protocols for distributed item-based Collaborative Filtering. Our protocols allow to compute both the predicted ratings of items and their predicted rankings, without compromising privacy nor predictions' accuracy. Unlike previous solutions in which the secure protocols are executed solely by the vendors, our protocols assume the existence of a mediator that performs intermediate computations on encrypted data supplied by the vendors. Such a mediated setting is advantageous over the non-mediated one since it enables each vendor to communicate solely with the mediator. This yields reduced communication costs and it allows each vendor to issue recommendations to its clients without being dependent on the availability and willingness of the other vendors to collaborate.},

abstract = {The unbiasedness of online product ratings, an important property to ensure that users' ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations to products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to "discover" the distortions from historical ratings in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the "debiasing operations" in real rating systems are the main objectives of this work.Using 42 million real customer ratings, we first show that users either "assimilate" or "contrast" to historical ratings under different scenarios: users conform to historical ratings if historical ratings are not far from the product quality (assimilation), while users deviate from historical ratings if historical ratings are significantly different from the product quality (contrast). This phenomenon can be explained by the well-known psychological argument: the "Assimilate-Contrast" theory. However, none of the existing works on modeling historical ratings' influence have taken this into account, and this motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the first model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF also allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modeling perspective, and it perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects we previously observed. Also, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings, and accurately predicts the relationships revealed in previous empirical measurements on real ratings. Finally, we show that HIALF can contribute to better recommendations by decoupling users' real preference from distorted ratings, and reveal the intrinsic product quality for wiser consumer purchase decisions.},

This paper investigates the Group Recommendation problem from a novel aspect, which tries to maximize the satisfaction of each group member while minimizing the unfairness between them. In this work, we present several semantics of the individual utility and propose two concepts of social welfare and fairness for modeling the overall utilities and the balance between group members. We formulate the problem as a multiple objective optimization problem and show that it is NP-Hard in different semantics. Given the multiple-objective nature of fairness-aware group recommendation problem, we provide an optimization framework for fairness-aware group recommendation from the perspective of Pareto Efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and evaluate our algorithm in terms of standard accuracy metrics. The results indicate that our algorithm achieves superior performances and considering fairness in group recommendation can enhance the recommendation accuracy.},

However frequently possible, readers rarely authenticate themselves on news publishers' websites. This paper proposes an approach for such cases. It provides a basic degree of personalization while complying with the key characteristics of news recommendation including news popularity, recency, and the dynamics of reading behavior. We extend existing research on the dynamics of news reading behavior by focusing both on the progress of reading interests over time and their relations. Reading interests are considered in three levels: short-, medium-, and long-term. Combinations of these are evaluated in terms of added value to the recommendation's performance and ensured news variety. Experiments with 17-month worth of logs from a German news publisher show that most frequent relations between news reading interests are constant in time but their probabilities change. Recommendations based on combined short-term and long-term interests result in increased accuracy while recommendations based on combined short-term and medium-term interests yield higher news variety.},

The recommender system should make predictions based on session data, e.g. session clicks and descriptions of clicked items. Conventional recommendation approaches, which rely on past user-item interaction data, cannot deliver accurate results in these situations. In this paper, we describe a method that combines session clicks and content features such as item descriptions and item categories to generate recommendations. To model these data, which are usually of different types and nature, we use 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks with character-level encoding of all input data. While 3D architectures provide a natural way to capture spatio-temporal patterns, character-level networks allow modeling different data types using their raw textual representation, thus reducing feature engineering effort. We applied the proposed method to predict add-to-cart events in e-commerce websites, which is more difficult then predicting next clicks. On two real datasets, our method outperformed several baselines and a state-of-the-art method based on recurrent neural networks.},

Then, the set of source items are passed through an encoder, whose learned representation is used by the decoder to estimate the sequence of target items. Therefore, as this process is performed pair-wise, we hypothesize that the model could capture the transition regularities in a more fine grained way. Additionally, our model incorporates an attention mechanism to explicitly learn the more expressive portions of the sequences in order to improve performance. Besides modeling the user sessions, we also extended the original architecture by means of attaching a second decoder that is jointly trained to predict the purchasing intent of user in each session. With this, we want to explore to what extent the model can capture inter session dependencies.We performed an empirical study comparing against several baselines on a large real world dataset, showing that our approach is competitive in both item and intent prediction.},

abstract = {Modeling the complex interactions between users and items as well as amongst items themselves is at the core of designing successful recommender systems. One classical setting is predicting users' personalized sequential behavior (or 'next-item' recommendation), where the challenges mainly lie in modeling 'third-order' interactions between a user, her previously visited item(s), and the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these higher-order interactions into a combination of pairwise relationships, by way of which user preferences (user-item interactions) and sequential patterns (item-item interactions) are captured by separate components. In this paper, we propose a unified method, TransRec, to model such third-order relationships for large-scale sequential prediction. Methodologically, we embed items into a 'transition space' where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. Empirically, this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a wide spectrum of real-world datasets. Data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/ruining-he/.},

Pairwise learning-to-rank techniques have been relatively successful. Hence, they are popularly used for learning recommender model parameters such as those in collaborative filtering (CF) models. The model parameters are learned by optimizing close smooth approximations of the non-smooth information retrieval (IR) metrics such as Mean Area Under ROC curve (AUC).Targeted campaigns are an alternative to item recommendations for increasing conversion. The user ranking task is referred to as audience retrieval. It is used in targeted campaigns to rank push campaign recipients based on their potential to convert. In this work, we consider the task of efficiently learning a ranking model that provides item recommendations and user rankings simultaneously. We adopt pairwise learning for this task. We refer to our approach as multi-objective pairwise ranking (MPR).We describe our approach and use experiments to evaluate its performance.},

In this paper we adopt an elementary view on FMs. Specifically, we view FMs as a sum of simple surfaces - a hyperplane plus several squared hyperplanes - in the original feature space. This elementary view, although equivalent to that of low rank matrix factorization, is geometrically more intuitive and points to some interesting generalizations. Led by our intuition, we challenge our understanding of the inductive bias of FMs by showing a simple dataset where FMs counterintuitively fail to learn the weight of the interaction between two features. We discuss the reasons, and mathematically formulate and prove a form of this limitation. Also inspired by our elementary view, we propose modeling intermediate orders of interaction, such as 1.5-way FMs. Beyond the specific proposals, the goal of this paper is to expose our thoughts and ideas to the research community in an effort to take FMs to the next level.},

abstract = {The item cold-start problem is inherent to collaborative filtering (CF) recommenders where items and users are represented by vectors in a latent space. It emerges since CF recommenders rely solely on historical user interactions to characterize their item inventory. As a result, an effective serving of new and trendy items to users may be delayed until enough user feedback is received, thus, reducing both users' and content suppliers' satisfaction. To mitigate this problem, many commercial recommenders apply random exploration and devote a small portion of their traffic to explore new items and gather interactions from random users. Alternatively, content or context information is combined into the CF recommender, resulting in a hybrid system. Another hybrid approach is to learn a mapping between the item attribute space and the CF latent feature space, and use it to characterize the new items providing initial estimates for their latent vectors.In this paper, we adopt the attribute-to-feature mapping approach to expedite random exploration of new items and present LearnAROMA - an advanced algorithm for learning the mapping, previously proposed in the context of classification. In particular, LearnAROMA learns a Gaussian distribution over the mapping matrix. Numerical evaluation demonstrates that this learning technique achieves more accurate initial estimates than logistic regression methods. We then consider a random exploration setting, in which new items are further explored as user interactions arrive. To leverage the initial latent vector estimates with the incoming interactions, we propose DynamicBPR - an algorithm for updating the new item latent vectors without retraining the CF model. Numerical evaluation reveals that DynamicBPR achieves similar accuracy as a CF model trained on all the ratings, using 71% less exploring users than conventional random exploration.},

abstract = {Recommender system is a popular tool to accurately and actively provide users with potentially interesting information. For capturing the users' preferences and approximating the missing data, matrix completion and approximation are widely adopted. Except for the typical low-rank factorization-based methods, the additive co-clustering approach (ACCAMS) is recently proposed to succinctly approximate large-scale rating matrix. Although ACCAMS efficiently produces effective recommendation result, it still suffers from the cold-start problem. To address this issue, we propose a Social Influence Additive Co-Clustering method (SIACC) by making use of user-item rating data and user-user social relations.The main idea of SIACC is to extract the social influences from the social network, integrate them to additive co-clustering for effectively determining the user clusters and item clusters, minimize the loss error by backfitting the residuals of data approximation in the previous iteration, and finally improve the recommendation performance. In order to take advantage of social influence, we present a graph-regularized weighted-Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (gwFCM) to cluster users. gwFCM has ability to identify user groups from both rating and social information. Specifically, gwFCM makes sure that a pair of users have similar cluster membership if they have direct social relation (denoted as local social influence), and that the user with higher reputation (denoted as global social influence) plays a dominate role in clustering process. The reasonable user clusters obtained by gwFCM can benefit the item clustering, which will leverage the additive co-clustering processing and further improve the recommendation performance. A series of experiments on three real-world datasets have shown that SIACC outperforms the existing popular recommendation methods (PMF and ACCAMS) and social recommendation methods (SoReg, TrustMF, Locabal and SPF), especially on the cold-start users recommendation and running time.},

abstract = {In recommender systems based on low-rank factorization of a partially observed user-item matrix, a common phenomenon that plagues many otherwise effective models is the interleaving of good and spurious recommendations in the top-K results. A single spurious recommendation can dramatically impact the perceived quality of a recommender system. Spurious recommendations do not result in serendipitous discoveries but rather cognitive dissonance. In this work, we investigate folding, a major contributing factor to spurious recommendations. Folding refers to the unintentional overlap of disparate groups of users and items in the low-rank embedding vector space, induced by improper handling of missing data. We formally define a metric that quantifies the severity of folding in a trained system, to assist in diagnosing its potential to make inappropriate recommendations. The folding metric complements existing information retrieval metrics that focus on the number of good recommendations and their ranks but ignore the impact of undesired recommendations. We motivate the folding metric definition on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world datasets. In studying the relationship between the folding metric and other characteristics of recommender systems, we observe that optimizing for goodness metrics can lead to high folding and thus more spurious recommendations.},

The goal is to suggest new links that will be perceived as positive by users. However, as signed social networks and newer content services become common, it is important to distinguish between positive and negative preferences. Even in existing applications, the cost of a negative recommendation could be high when people are looking for new jobs, friends, or places to live.In this work, we develop novel probabilistic latent factor models to recommend positive links and compare them with existing methods on five different openly available datasets. Our models are able to produce better ranking lists and are effective in the task of ranking positive links at the top, with fewer negative links (flops). Moreover, we find that modeling signed social networks and user preferences this way has the advantage of increasing the diversity of recommendations. We also investigate the effect of regularization on the quality of recommendations, a matter that has not received enough attention in the literature. We find that regularization parameter heavily affects the quality of recommendations in terms of both accuracy and diversity.},

abstract = {In recommending POIs(Point-Of-Interests), factors such as the diversity of the recommended POIs are as important as accuracy for providing a satisfactory recommendation. Although existing diversification methods can help POI recommender systems suggest more diverse POIs, they lack "geographical diversification," which results in the concentration of the supposedly "diverse" recommended POIs on "a small portion" in areas where the target-user is most active. This is caused by the neglect of POI locations in the diversification, i.e., existing diversification methods try to diversify the categories of recommended items. However, geographical diversification is essential for users whose activity interests comprise many sub-areas and who require a variety of recommended POIs encompassing all their activity interests. In this paper, we propose a novel proportional geographical diversification method that recommends a variety of POIs located in the activity district of a user such that the variety of sub-areas in the district is proportional to the frequency of his/her activity in each sub-area. We compare the performance of the proposed method with existing diversification methods using real datasets. The evaluation result shows that no method except the proposed one can significantly increase geographical diversity at the expense of tolerable accuracy loss.},

abstract = {The technical barriers for conversing with recommender systems using natural language are vanishing. Already, there are commercial systems that facilitate interactions with an AI agent. For instance, it is possible to say "what should I watch" to an Apple TV remote to get recommendations. In this research, we investigate how users initially interact with a new natural language recommender to deepen our understanding of the range of inputs that these technologies can expect. We deploy a natural language interface to a recommender system, we observe users' first interactions and follow-up queries, and we measure the differences between speaking- and typing-based interfaces. We employ qualitative methods to derive a categorization of users' first queries (objective, subjective, and navigation) and follow-up queries (refine, reformulate, start over). We employ quantitative methods to determine the differences between speech and text, finding that speech inputs are typically longer and more conversational.},

abstract = {Research into recommendation algorithms has made great strides in recent years. However, these algorithms are typically applied in relatively straightforward scenarios: given information about a user's past preferences, what will they like in the future? Recommendation is often more complex: evaluating recommended items never takes place in a vacuum, and it is often a single step in the user's more complex background task. In this paper, we define a specific type of recommendation scenario called narrative-driven recommendation, where the recommendation process is driven by both a log of the user's past transactions as well as a narrative description of their current interest(s). Through an analysis of a set of real-world recommendation narratives from the LibraryThing forums, we demonstrate the uniqueness and richness of this scenario and highlight common patterns and properties of such narratives.},

abstract = {Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources.In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.},

A prominent example in the travel industry is Airbnb, which connects guests with hosts, allowing both to exchange cultural experiences in addition to the economic transaction. Nonetheless, Airbnb guest profiles are typically sparse, which limits the applicability of traditional lodging recommendation approaches. Inspired by recent socio-economic analyses of repurchase intent behavior on Airbnb, we propose a context-aware learning-to-rank approach for lodging recommendation, aimed to infer the user's perception of several dimensions involved in choosing which lodging to book. In particular, we devise features aimed to capture the user's price sensitivity as well as their perceived value of a particular lodging, the risk involved in choosing it rather than other available options, the authenticity of the cultural experience it could provide, and its overall perception by other users through word of mouth. Through a comprehensive evaluation using publicly available Airbnb data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to a number of alternative recommendation baselines, including a simulation of Airbnb's own recommender.},

abstract = {Recommendation algorithms that incorporate techniques from deep learning are becoming increasingly popular. Due to the structure of the data coming from recommendation domains (i.e., one-hot-encoded vectors of item preferences), these algorithms tend to have large input and output dimensionalities that dominate their overall size. This makes them difficult to train, due to the limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios. In some cases, they even improve over the original accuracy, with relative increases up to 12%. We evaluate Bloom embeddings on 7 data sets and compare it against 4 alternative methods, obtaining favorable results. We also discuss a number of further advantages of Bloom embeddings, such as 'on-the-fly' constant-time operation, zero or marginal space requirements, training time speedups, or the fact that they do not require any change to the core model architecture or training configuration.},

abstract = {Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is available. For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item, and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks. We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in recommendation, even when the target user's review for the target item is not available. Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item pair. We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another latent representation of the target user's review of the target item. We show that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review texts. This review information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties, as well as enhancing the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review texts from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly which enable the interaction between users and items in a similar way as matrix factorization. The local attention provides us insight on a user's preferences or an item's properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on the semantic meaning of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by testing on popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factor and topical (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). Our proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classification and recommendation. These results also confirm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.},

For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al.~recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true effectiveness of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.},

The main objective of our work is to develop a recommendation system to recommend a subset of reviews that have high content score and good coverage over different aspects of the product along with their associated sentiments. We address the challenge which arises due to the fact that similar aspects are mentioned in different reviews using different natural language expressions. We use vector representations to identify mentions of similar aspects and map them with aspects mentioned in product features specifications. Review helpfulness score may act as a proxy for the quality of reviews, but new reviews do not have any helpfulness score. We address the cold start problem by using a dynamic convolutional neural network to estimate the quality score from review content. The system is evaluated on datasets from Amazon and Flipkart and is found to be more effective than the competing methods.},

As an example, in a restaurant recommendation scenario, the aspects may regard food quality, service, position, athmosphere of the place and so on. Such a multi-faceted representation of the user is used to feed a multi-criteria CF algorithm which predicts user interest in a particular item and provides her with recommendations.In the experimental session we evaluated the performance of the algorithm against several state-of-the-art baselines; Results confirmed the insight behind this work, since our approach was able to overcome both single-criteria recommendation algorithms as well as more sophisticated techniques based on matrix factorization.},

abstract = {In the last years, there has been much attention given to the semantic gap problem in multimedia retrieval systems. Much effort has been devoted to bridge this gap by building tools for the extraction of high-level, semantics-based features from multimedia content, as low-level features are not considered useful because they deal primarily with representing the perceived content rather than the semantics of it.In this paper, we explore a different point of view by leveraging the gap between low-level and high-level features. We experiment with a recent approach for movie recommendation that extract low-level Mise-en-Sc\'{e}ne features from multimedia content and combine it with high-level features provided by the wisdom of the crowd.To this end, we first performed an offline performance assessment by implementing a pure content-based recommender system with three different versions of the same algorithm, respectively based on (i) conventional movie attributes, (ii) mise-en-scene features, and (iii) a hybrid method that interleaves recommendations based on movie attributes and mise-en-scene features. In a second study, we designed an empirical study involving 100 subjects and collected data regarding the quality perceived by the users. Results from both studies show that the introduction of mise-en-sc\'{e}ne features in conjunction with traditional movie attributes improves both offline and online quality of recommendations.},

To address this property, we propose a novel dynamic collaboration recommendation method by adapting the multi-agent reinforcement learning technique to the coauthor network analysis. The collaborator selection is optimized from several different scholar similarity measurements. Unlike prior studies, the proposed method characterizes scholarly competition, a.k.a. different scholars will compete for potential collaborator at each iteration. An evaluation with the ACM data shows that multi-agent reinforcement learning plus scholarly competition modeling can be significant for collaboration recommendation.},

abstract = {A decade has passed since the seminal Netflix Prize competition and Collaborative Filtering (CF) models are still at the forefront of Recommender System research. Significant progress has been achieved over this time, yet key aspects of the basic problem formulation have not been seriously challenged. Most state-of-the-art models still assume a supervised model in which the ultimate goal is to predict future user-item interactions based on the generalization of historical data.We wish to initiate a discussion on some key assumptions behind much of the mainstream research: What is the difference between predicting future user actions and optimizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)? Does a trade-off between accuracy and diversity really exist? Is supervised CF based on historical data still relevant in the age of modern reinforcement learning models such as contextual bandits? What evaluation metrics can be used prior to online experimentations and what are their limitations? Our main thesis is that at the core of all these issues lies a gap between most Collaborative Filtering models and the true objective of industry systems.},

abstract = {The digital game industry has recently adopted recommendation systems to provide suitable game and content choices to players. Recommendations in digital games have several unique applications and challenges compared to other well known recommendation system such as those for movies and books. Designers must adopt different architectures and algorithms to overcome these challenges. In this talk, we describe the game recommendation system at Electronic Arts. It leverages heterogeneous player data across many games to provide intelligent recommendations. We discuss three example applications: recommending games for purchase, suitable game map, and game difficulty.Like the movie and book recommendation problem, one application is to recommend the next favorite games for a player. Digital games fall into a wide range of genres such as first player shooting (FPS), sports, and role-playing games (RPG). Games within the same genre however tend to be unique and creative. While the recommendation item space is smaller, the recommendation system should also manage different types of contents such as games and extra downloadable contents to play, editorial videos and tutorials to watch.The second application provides the game mode and map recommendations within a game to improve player experience. Many online digital games, especially FPS and sports games, contain different maps and game modes to provide diverse gameplay experience. Different maps and game modes often require different skill levels, strategies, or cooperation from players, and the maps and game modes are often played repeatedly. Therefore, recommending the most suitable map and game mode is important from smooth onboarding experience to retain players who are likely to churn. In the map and game mode recommendation application, the algorithms need to evaluate both the short-term actions as well as long term effects of playing different maps and game modes to optimize player's engagement.In addition, we also use the same recommendation system to adjust in-game configurations such as difficulty. Players have a wide variety of experiences, skills, learning rates, and playing styles, and will react differently to the same difficulty setting. Second, even for an individual player, one's difficulty preference may also change over time. For example, in a level progression game, a player who loses the first several attempts to one level might feel much less frustrated compared to losing after tens of unsuccessful trials. The difficulty recommendation provides suggestions and adjustments on game configuration based on the player's previous gameplay experience to maximize the engagement. For online multiplayer games, recommending partners and opponents in matchmaking is also an effective way to improve player experience.We developed one flexible recommendation system to satisfy the need of different applications and that executes data-driven algorithms such collaborative filtering and multi-armed bandit. The centralized system leverages entire player and game data for all recommendation applications in digital games, supports unified roll-out and update, and at the same time measures the performance together via A/B testing experiments. Moreover, the one system strategy is easy to generate consistent recommendations across multiple games and platforms. We tested these recommendation applications in EA website and games, an observed significant improvements in click-through-rate and engagement.},

abstract = {Search ranking is a fundamental problem of crucial interest to major Internet companies, including web search engines, content publishing websites and marketplaces. However, despite sharing some common characteristics a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist in this space. Given a large difference in content that needs to be ranked and the parties affected by ranking, each search ranking problem is somewhat specific. Correspondingly, search ranking at Airbnb is quite unique, being a two-sided marketplace in which one needs to optimize for host and guest preferences, in a world where a user rarely consumes the same item twice and one listing can accept only one guest for a certain set of dates. In this talk, I will discuss challenges we have encountered and Machine Learning solutions we have developed for listing ranking at Airbnb. Specifically, the listing ranking problem boils down to prioritizing listings that are appealing to the guest but at the same time demoting listings that would likely reject the guest, which is not easily solvable using basic matrix completion or a straightforward linear model. I will shed the light on how we jointly optimize the two objectives by leveraging listing quality, location relevance, reviews, host response time as well as guest and host preferences and past booking history. Finally, we will talk about our recent work on using neural network models to train listing and query embeddings for purposes of enhancing search personalization, broad search and type-ahead suggestions, which are core concepts in any modern search.},

abstract = {Across different web services, we hear about recommendation systems that help users tackle information overload. Travel is different: the world does not have millions of cities, but finding new, interesting places to inspire people to travel is still a challenge. What are the factors that make traveling to destinations appealing, and how do those factors change based on your origin? What data, algorithms, and interactions do we need to surface destinations as recommendations? Moreover, how can a recommender system be built in a domain where typical users will book a flight, anonymously, less than a handful of times per year?Years ago, Skyscanner1 started it's 'everywhere' search, allowing users to find the cheapest countries to travel to. This feature evolved into an 'inspiration feed'; a stream of destinations, again ordered by price. However, price is just one of many factors that can make a place attractive. In this talk, I'll discuss how we've bootstrapped a destination recommender system to augment Skyscanner's destination feeds with wisdom-of-the-crowd recommendations, and give an overview of experiments that gauge how localised and personalised recommendations affects user engagement in different parts of the Android and iOS apps.There are a variety of challenges that we had to tackle in this domain, ranging from data sourcing, sampling, and segmenting, to metric and algorithm selection, and building a pipeline that could facilitate rapid online and offline experimentation. We now have a system that uses the rich implicit data generated by Skyscanner's millions of users alongside a set of diverse algorithmic approaches to compute destination recommendations. Experimental features that use this pipeline are also collecting unique interaction data that is being analysed to further personalise users' recommendations. This talk will give an overview of the journey so far and some potential future directions and research challenges for recommendation in the travel domain.},

abstract = {Time plays a key role in recommendation. Handling it properly is especially critical when using recommender systems in real-world applications, which may not be as clear when doing research with historical data. In this talk, we will discuss some of the important challenges of handling time in recommendation algorithms at Netflix. We will focus on challenges related to how our users, items, and systems all change over time. We will then discuss some strategies for tackling these challenges, which revolves around proper treatment of causality in our systems.One clear way that time impacts recommendations is that users and items change over time. Users and items come and go from a service. Individual user interests also change, which could be someone picking up a new interest or even just people maturing and their tastes changing. Many recommendation approaches are based on historical co-occurrence, in which case they tend to lag with such changes instead of anticipating them. An item that is new to the system may start cold but then develop a lot of interest because it is new. So the level of interest in an item fluctuates across time, which can be additionally impacted by trends such as external events and seasonality.Beyond these, the system itself changes over time. Feedback loops in the system, where users actions are influenced by the output of the recommendation system, cause the data that the system uses for recommendations to evolve over time. These feedback loops also can degrade the quality of the recommendations because it becomes hard to tease apart when a user is playing something because they enjoy it versus when they are playing it because it was shown prominently. These loops also can make it difficult for new algorithms to be trained and evaluated due to the influence of the production system. Different components of the system also can change over time, which can impact the data seen by other components. Time also becomes a tradeoff for how accurate a model can be against the time it takes to learn or compute recommendations for a certain request. A model giving very promising results offline but taking weeks to learn might be outperformed online by a model with weaker results but more responsive. On the other hand, changing fast may improve online accuracy by being responsive but may also confuse users when everything changes quickly.Since time is fundamental to the recommendation problem, we seek to optimize our handling of time in our systems. This includes designing experimentation around time by splitting across time and avoiding time-traveling data. It means introducing controlled stochasticity and counterfactuals to break feedback loops and understand causality. It means treating time as a first-class citizen in algorithms. It also means that we often want to optimize our recommendation systems such that a user minimizes the time a user needs to interact with it so that they can find something great to watch.},

abstract = {There has been a lot of recent interest in building recommender systems for fashion, with increased attention and investment from the retail industry. For academia, the fashion domain presents new challenges and opportunities that have not been explored before.Dressipi is a personalisation and style advice engine for women's fashion. We work with some of the biggest retailers in the UK who have integrated our service into their site, and are currently expanding to the US and Australia. Since our launch in 2011 we have been helping millions of users find the clothes that they will love, buy and keep.In this talk I will discuss the unique characteristics of the fashion domain and some of the most interesting challenges they pose for recommender systems. Fashion is inherently social and public: we dress not only for ourselves but also for the appropriateness of the environment we are in. When a user buys clothes it is not only important that they like the items themselves, but also that they feel confident and comfortable in the situation they are in. Fashion recommendations must satisfy two sometimes competing objectives: identifying the user's personal preference from their past behaviour and giving advice on what changes to their style would make them look better. Unlike other domains, recommendations should not be purely based on the user's personal taste and past activity. They must also take public perception into account by being aware of fashion rules, outfit guidelines and current trends.Many companies providing recommendations in this space have realised that the user-item interaction data alone can only get you so far. We have started gathering additional personal information about the users in questionnaires, if they wish to provide it. Examples of this include body shape, age, favourite colours, lifestyle etc. These additional data points allow for some exciting applications such as giving style advice and generating high quality recommendation reasons that are useful to the user. For example: `A bodycon dress is a figure flaunting style for your slender frame'.The main challenges addressed in this talk are:â€¢ Users are looking for guidance and validation that their fashion choices present the best version of themselves.â€¢ There are objective fashion do's and dont's that professional stylists know about but users might not.â€¢ Trends and popular culture events influence user preference and public perception quickly and sometimes drastically.â€¢ Good recommendation reasons are extremely important, especially when trying to give advice and recommend items outside of the user's comfort zone.â€¢ Outfits: a big factor in the decision to buy an item is the user's existing wardrobe. It is important for them to know whether they can wear the new item together with garments they already own to create good outfits.},

abstract = {Farfetch is a global fashion marketplace with a catalog that, at any time, has over 200 000 products spanning over 2000 brands from luxury boutiques all around the world. Finding the right product to the right customer is a challenge that, we, as Data Scientists working on the Recommendations team, are trying to solve using state-of-the art algorithms and disruptive technologies. Deep learning (DL) is an area of Machine Learning that has recently been brought to the spotlight for its breakthrough results across several domains. In this talk, we will provide an overview of some ongoing projects in which Deep Learning methods play a major role.A common problem in online marketplaces with large catalogs such as ours is the lack of detailed metadata about the products. Particularly, features such as style, colors, pattern, occasion, sizing, etc., are known to drive customers intent but are hard to catalog manually, in a consistent way. We explain how we use our extensive dataset of normalized product images together with state of the art convolutional neural networks to extract visual features. These can then be used to provide better recommendations and improve other applications across the platform.Another application of DL is to capture relationships between products which are stylistically complementary. We leverage data from thousands of hand-curated outfits to model these intangible fashion concepts only a human specialist can provide, and generalize a method of recommending complementary products using deep siamese neural networks. This an alternative recommendation strategy that can be used to drive cross-sell opportunities.These are merely a sample of problems we are tackling using DL at Farfetch. We believe that there are plenty of opportunities for application of these techniques to recommender systems and we look forward to discussing the potentials of this stream of research with the RecSys community.},

abstract = {Online learning is a hot trend in the education industry, as testified by the proliferation of e-learning platforms and MOOCs on a huge variety of topics, from science and technology to foreign language learning and musical instruments playing.In this talk we will present some of the common challenges in the e-learning industry that we are personally facing at Cloud Academy, an on-line continuous training platform for Cloud technologies.First, the nature of recommendation objects is quite diversified. Typically an e-learning platform comprises several content types, such as video lessons, reading material, quizzes, practical exercises (e.g., hands-on laboratories), etc. Also, they can be organized into composite objects, such as whole courses (groups of lessons) or exams (topic-specific quizzes and exercises).Signals are very heterogeneous, too. Users can trigger all sorts of events while interacting with the learning platform, such as time spent on a given lesson video, outcome of a quiz or a test after a specific number of attempts, natural language feedback, etc. Such variety can be an important and comprehensive source of information but it must be normalized and handled within an appropriate common framework.The objectives of recommendation in e-learning differ from the case of more well-established targets. Although enjoyment remains a driving force (e.g., proposing new interesting courses to an old user), the focus is on learning specific skills or topics for specific goals. In this scenario, recommendation seeks to suggest the new best lesson, exercise, or course to acquire the desired skill while keeping the user engaged, assembling a personalized study path in the process. The pace of the learning activity must be tailored on the user's needs and commitments, like deadlines (e.g., the user plans to get a certification by a certain date), specific goals (e.g., objectives of an employee might be defined by the user's manager) or learning prerequisites (e.g., a course can be consumed only after the student has acquired the needed knowledge, either via other more basic courses or pre-existing skills).Consequently, recommendations must take into account the initial user skills and knowledge as well as her learning objectives (e.g., improving the skills of a non-beginner student requires recommending more advanced material). Transparency plays an important role in the e-learning domain as users are willing to continuously monitor and inspect their progress and understand which training resources better fit their learning goals.Finally, the online learning environment can be made even more complex by "social features" such as virtual classes of multiple users, a context that recommender systems both can exploit and need to take into account.},

abstract = {Blendle is a New York Times backed startup that builds a platform where users can explore and support the world's best journalism. Users can read all content from 120 publications and only pay for what they read. Every morning, at Blendle, we have a huge cold-start problem when over 8.000 new articles from the latest editions of newspapers arrive in our system. At that moment, these articles are read by virtually no-one and we are tasked with sending out personalised newsletters to over 1 million users. We can thus not rely on collaborative filtering type of recommendations, nor can we use the popularity of the articles as clues for what our user might want to read. We overcome our cold-start problem by a mix of curation by our editorial team and an automated analysis of the content of these articles. We extract named entities, semantic links, authors, the language and plenty of stylometrics. For each of our users, we build a very fine grained profile based on the attributes of the articles that they read. The combination of enriched articles and user profiles is fed into our machine learning pipeline. We are currently experimenting with an online learning to rank setup, where each of our users is exposed to a slightly perturbed version of our ranking model. We observe the interactions of our users to infer in which direction we should be updating the model. Our editorial team gets up at around 5am every morning to read what was published over night. They are done reading and recommending their selection of articles around 8am, which is also the time we would ideally send out the newsletter so that our users, on their commute to work, can read our newsletter. These timing restrictions pose yet another challenge: our content analysis and machine learning pipeline needs to be really fast. We solve this by using a streaming infrastructure build on Kafka. In this infrastructure, an article is analysed and scored for relevance towards each of our users as soons as it arrives. This has the advantage that at 8am, when our editorial team is done reading, personalisation is much more lightweight. We use the precomputed relevance scores and balance them with diversity to arrive at a unique ranking for each of our users. In this talk, I will detail how we enrich articles in a streaming fashion and how we use online learning methods to learn a ranking model. I will also talk about how we deal with the time constraints of the problem we are trying to solve.},

abstract = {We study bandit algorithms for e-commerce recommender systems. The question we pose is whether it is necessary to consider reinforcement learning effects in recommender systems. A key reason to introduce a recommender system for a product page on an e-commerce site is to increase the order value by improving the chance of making an upsale. If the recommender system merely predicts the next purchase, there might be no positive effect at all on the order value, since the recommender system predicts sales that would have happened independent of the recommender system. What we really are looking for are the false negatives, i.e., purchases that happen as a consequence of the recommender system. These purchases entail the entire uplift and should be present as reinforcement learning effects. This effect cannot be displayed in a simulation of the site, since there are no reinforcement learning effects present in a simulation. The attribution model must capture the uplift to guarantee an increased order value. However, such an attribution model is not practical, due to data sparsity. Given this starting point, we study some standard attribution models for e-commerce recommender systems, and describe how these fare when applied in a reinforcement learning algorithm, both in a simulation and on live sites.},

abstract = {CheckInShop is an app that employs sensors to capture the user preferences in physical stores and provide either micro-location marketing or product recommendations. By utilizing iBeacon technology and with the exploitation of a mobile app, we keep track of customer's preferences in physical stores. Then, based on the time that a product is viewed by a customer and his micro-location inside the store, we send to him either product offers or recommendations of similar products to the ones he is looking at. These recommendations are accurate because they are provided at the right time and in the right place.

abstract = {We present a research tool for user preference elicitation that collects both explicit user feedback and unobtrusively acquired facial expressions. The concrete implementation is a web-based user interface where the user is presented with two music excerpts. After listening to both, the user provides a pairwise score (i.e. which of the two items is preferred) for each pair of music excerpts. The novelty of the demo is the integration of the unobtrusive acquisition of facial expressions through the webcam. During the listening of the music excerpts, the system extracts features related to the facial expressions of the user several times per second. The interaction runs as a web application, which allows for a large-scale remote acquisition of emotional data. Up to now, such acquisitions were usually done in controlled environments with few subjects, hence being of little use for the recommender systems community.},

abstract = {Modern e-commerce platforms pose both opportunities as well as hurdles for merchants. While merchants can observe markets at any point in time and automatically reprice their products, they also have to compete simultaneously with dozens of competitors. Currently, retailers lack the possibility to test, develop, and evaluate their algorithms appropriately before releasing them into the real world. At the same time, it is challenging for researchers to investigate how pricing strategies interact with each other under heavy competition. To study dynamic pricing competition on online marketplaces, we built an open simulation platform. To be both flexible and scalable, the platform has a microservice-based architecture and handles large numbers of competing merchants and arriving consumers. It allows merchants to deploy the full width of pricing strategies, from simple rule-based strategies to more sophisticated data-driven strategies using machine learning. Our platform enables analyses of how a strategy's performance is affected by customer behavior, price adjustment frequencies, the competitors' strategies, and the exit/entry of competitors. Moreover, our platform allows to study the long-term behavior of self-adapting strategies.},

In this demo paper, we describe how we plan to integrate Citolytics into the Wikipedia infrastructure by using Elasticsearch and Apache Flink to serve recommendations for Wikipedia articles. Additionally, we propose a large-scale online evaluation design using the Wikipedia Android app. Working with Wikipedia data has several unique advantages. First, the availability of a very large user sample contributes to statistically significant results. Second, the openness of Wikipedia's architecture allows making our source code and evaluation data public, thus benefiting other researchers. If link-based recommendations show promise in our online evaluation, a deployment of the presented system within Wikipedia would have a far-reaching impact on Wikipedia's more than 30 million users.},

It then breaks down contributions from different geographical and user behavior features, and those from individual points-of-interest versus pairs of consecutive points on a route. The system also supports detailed quantitative interrogation by comparing a large number of features for multiple points. Effective trajectory visualisations can potentially benefit a large cohort of online map users and assist their decision-making. More broadly, the design of this system can inform visualisations of other structured prediction tasks, such as for sequences or trees.},

Participating teams had to balance between user interests and requirements for the given job as well as dealing with the cold-start situation. For the first time in the history of the conference, the RecSys challenge offered an online evaluation: teams first had to compete as part of a traditional offline evaluation and the top 25 teams were then invited to evaluate their algorithms in an online setting, where they could submit recommendations to real users. Overall, 262 teams registered for the challenge, 103 teams actively participated and submitted together more than 6100 solutions as part of the offline evaluation. Finally, 18 teams participated and rolled out recommendations to more than 900,000 users on XING2.},

However, these state-of-the-art algorithms are typically applied in relatively straightforward scenarios. In reality, recommendation is often a more complex problem: it is usually just a single step in the user's more complex background need. These background needs can often place a variety of constraints on which recommendations are interesting to the user and when they are appropriate. However, relatively little research has been done on these complex recommendation scenarios. The ComplexRec 2017 workshop addressed this by providing an interactive venue for discussing approaches to recommendation in complex scenarios that have no simple one-size-fits-all-solution.},

abstract = {The particularities of musical data and its multiple modalities make original contributions possible in many core RecSys topics such as content-based and hybrid recommendation, user modeling, interfaces, and context-aware and mobile recommendations. But more urgently, the current revolution in the music industry represents major opportunities and challenges for recommendation systems in general. Recommendation systems are now central to music streaming platforms, which are rapidly increasing in listenership and becoming the top source of revenue for the music industry. It is increasingly more common for a music listener to simply access music than to purchase and own it in a personal collection. In this scenario, recommendation calls no longer for a one-shot recommendation for the purpose of a track or album purchase, but for a recommendation of a listening experience, comprising a very wide range of challenges, such as sequential recommendation, or conversational and contextual recommendations. Recommendation technologies now impact all actors in the rich and complex music industry ecosystem (listeners, labels, music makers and producers, concert halls, advertisers, etc.). To highlight these developments, we focus on three use cases: automatic playlist generation, context-aware music recommendation, and recommendation in the creative process of music making.},

The past few years have seen the tremendous success of deep neural networks in a number of complex machine learning tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition. After its relatively slow uptake by the recommender systems community, deep learning for recommender systems became widely popular in 2016.We believe that a tutorial on the topic of deep learning will do its share to further popularize the topic. Notable recent application areas are music recommendation, news recommendation, and session-based recommendation. The aim of the tutorial is to encourage the application of Deep Learning techniques in Recommender Systems, to further promote research in deep learning methods for Recommender Systems.},

E-commerce recommender systems can benefit enormously by also exploiting experiences of multiple customers captured in product reviews. In this tutorial, we present a range of techniques that allow recommender systems in e-commerce websites to take full advantage of reviews. This includes text mining methods for feature-specific sentiment analysis of products, topic models and distributed representations that bridge the vocabulary gap between user reviews and product descriptions. We present recommender algorithms that use review information to address the cold-start problem and generate recommendations with explanations.

Participants of the tutorial will be able to experiment with all the three systems by using interactive Jupyter and Zeppelin Notebooks. Our final objective is to compare and then blend batch and online methods to build models providing high quality top-k recommendation in non-stationary environments.},

abstract = {With the increasing number of online shopping services, the number of users and the quantity of visual and textual information on the Internet, there is a pressing need for intelligent recommendation systems that analyze the user's behavior amongst multiple domains and help them to find the desirable information without the burden of search. However, there is little research that has been done on complex recommendation scenarios that involve knowledge transfer across multiple domains. This problem is especially challenging when the involved data sources are complex in terms of the limitations on the quantity and quality of data that can be crawled. The goal of this paper is studying the connection between visual and textual inputs for better analysis of a certain domain, and to examine the possibility of knowledge transfer from complex domains for the purpose of efficient recommendations. The methods employed to achieve this study include both design of architecture and algorithms using deep learning technologies to analyze the effect of deep pixel-wise semantic segmentation and text integration on the quality of recommendations. We plan to develop a practical testing environment in a fashion domain.},

abstract = {The general recommendations for addressing non-communicable diseases, which are responsible for two thirds of deaths globally, are mainly related to lifestyle changes, such as diet and physical activity. Challenges with encouraging healthy diets include gathering accurate information about dietary intake and delivering interventions that can influence behavior. Internet technologies offer excellent potential for addressing these challenges. Furthermore, personalized recommendations are more effective than general population-based recommendations at modifying health-related behavior in nutrition interventions.The overall aim of this project is to design, develop and evaluate a recommender system able to assess dietary intake, using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and propose valid personalized nutrition advice for adults. It is investigating an effective way of providing personalized online dietary recommendations to increase diet quality at population-level and of considering an individual user's preferences, population data and experts' knowledge in the recommendation. The system is envisaged to be a web-based service, built with commercially available technologies, scalable, replicable, inexpensive and independent of any bespoke device (e.g. proprietary activity trackers).Different levels of personalized advice will be evaluated via an online Randomised Control Trial (RCT) and surveys with nutrition professionals will be used for rating the advice proposed by the recommender system.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) consists of filtering data, predicting users' preferences and providing recommendations accordingly. Commonly, neighborhood-based CF methods predict the future ratings based on similar users (user-based) or similar items (item-based) to perform recommendations. However, the reliability of the information provided by these pieces of evidence as well as the final predictions cannot be fully trusted. Incorporating trust in the recommendation process can be argued to be an important challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs). To tackle these issues, we propose new CF approaches under the belief function framework. The final prediction is obtained by fusing evidences from similar items or similar users using Dempster's rule of combination. The prediction process of our evidential approaches is able to provide the users with a global overview of their possible preferences. This would lead to increase their confidence towards the system as well as their satisfaction. In this paper, we mainly highlight the benefits of incorporating uncertainty in CF approaches using the belief function theory. We present the preliminary results and also discuss our ongoing works, as well as the challenges in the future.},

The utility function is learned through preference elicitation, an interactive process for collecting user feedback about recommended objects.
