abstract = {In this position paper, we describe the unique challenges of collaborative information retrieval (MLCIR) in an environment where information access and visibility is not equal across all participants. We call this multi-level collaborative information retrieval, after the term used to describe an environment with differing classification levels. In contrast to traditional collaborative information retrieval, which focuses on technologies to facilitate dynamics in a group, MLCIR must be aware of the information flow in a group, making sure there is not information contamination and inadvertent disclosure of information, while still allowing for collaboration. We cover some of the challenges, and discuss impact on not just formal MLCIR domains, but also more traditional collaborative information seeking domains.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present results of an on-line survey conducted in early 2010 to inquire about collaborative information seeking activities and behaviors in the context of Web searches. We recruited participants using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service to gather responses from people with a wide range of backgrounds. We present results about the frequency of collaborative Web searches, number of sessions involved, concurrency, location, collaborative group size, and communication methods used to collaborate. We draw comparisons with prior work and highlight collaborative search scenarios that are important for tools and systems to support.},

abstract = {Collaborative decision making is a successful approach in settings where data analysis and querying can be done interactively. In large scale systems with huge data volumes or many users, collaboration is often hindered by impractical runtimes.Existing work on improving collaboration focuses on avoiding redundancy for users working on the same task. While this improves the effectiveness of the user work process, the underlying query processing engine is typically considered a "black box" and left unchanged. Research in multiple query processing, on the other hand, ignores the application, and focuses on improving runtimes regardless of where the queries are issued from.In this work, we claim that progress can be made by taking a novel, more holistic view of the problem. We discuss a new approach that combines the two strands of research on the user experience and query engine parts in order to bring about more effective and more efficient retrieval systems that support the users' decision making process.We sketch promising research directions for more efficient algorithms for collaborative decision making, especially for large scale systems.},

abstract = {There are a many of image related search tasks that can be collaborative in nature and require input from more than one person e.g. organisation of photographs or videos from multiple views, students working on a class project etc. In this work in progress paper we describe a new image search paradigm, namely preference based image search. We describe initial implementations of this approach and some evaluations of this paradigm for image search. We also describe how this approach can be adapted for collaborative image retrieval, the potential benefits of a preference based paradigm for image retrieval and some limitations. Finally we describe how future work will realise a collaborative preference based image retrieval system.},

abstract = {Collaborative information retrieval is an emerging research field in charge of establishing techniques and methods to satisfy the shared information needs of groups of people that work together as a team, starting from the extension of the information seeking and retrieval process with the knowledge about the queries, the context, and the explicit collaboration habits among them. Unfortunately, in broad online communities that besides grow continuously (e.g., social networks, e-learning systems, or peer-to-peer networks) can be difficult the conformation of these groups, or all benefits can not be obtained, for the lack of transparency among users' seeking tasks in distributed environments. To address this issue, we propose in this work a recommender agent based on latent semantic indexing formalism to assist the users that search alone to find and join to groups with similar information needs. With this mechanism, a user can change easily her solo search intent to explicit collaborative search. We assume as hypothesis that both, the group and the new member will benefit. To validate our hypothesis we have designed an experiment with twelve groups of students in the context of search-driven software development.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the preliminary design of a novel synchronous collaborative web browsing system named CoFox. CoFox differs from other collaborative web browsing systems in that it provides a live video stream of web content being viewed by the remote user as the main awareness supporting mechanism. Additionally, it allows users to scroll through the remote user video screen capture to re-watch any part of the search session. As well as screen capture features, also included is a set of collaboration tools including video segment annotations, shared links and instant messaging. CoFox provides a platform for a pair of users to tackle collaborative tasks; which may greatly benefit from the expertise of more than one individual. We outline the graphical user interface components from which CoFox will be composed, the hypothetical benefits provided by such a system and finally describe a possible user-based evaluation methodology.},
