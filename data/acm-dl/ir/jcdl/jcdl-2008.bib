abstract = {This work shows how the content of a digital library can be enhanced to better satisfy its users' needs. Missing content is identified by finding missing content topics in the system's query log or in a pre-defined taxonomy of required knowledge. The collection is then enhanced with new relevant knowledge, which is extracted from external sources that satisfy those missing content topics. Experiments we conducted measure the precision of the system before and after content enhancement. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the system effectiveness as a result of content enhancement and the superiority of the missing content enhancement policy over several other possible policies.},

This is promising news for low-resource languages and digital collections seeking to leverage a small human investment into much larger gain. The library architecture in which this work is developed allows us to query customized subcorpora to report on lexical usage by author, genre or era and allows us to continually update the lexicon as new texts are added to the collection.},

abstract = {We propose and evaluate a "content-driven search keyword suggester" for keyword-based search in literature digital libraries. Suggesting search keywords at an early stage, i.e., while the user is entering search terms, is helpful for constructing more accurate, less ambiguous, and focused search keywords for queries. Our search keyword suggestion approach is based on an a priori analysis of the publication collection in the digital library at hand, and consists of the following steps. We (i) parse the document collection using the Link Grammar parser, a syntactic parser of English, (ii) group publications based on their "most-specific" research topics, (iii) use the parser output to build a hierarchical structure of simple and compound tokens to be used to suggest search terms, (iv) use TextRank, a text summarization tool, to assign topic-sensitive scores to keywords, and (v) use the identified research-topics to help user aggregate search keywords prior to the actual search query execution.We experimentally show that the proposed framework, which is optimized to work on literature digital libraries, promises a more scalable, high quality, and user-friendly search-keyword suggester when compared to its competitors. We validate our proposal experimentally using a subset of the ACM SIGMOD Anthology digital library as a testbed, and by employing the research-pyramid model to identify the "most-specific" research topics.},

And how do 3D book models compare with actual books?This paper reports on a user study designed to compare the performance of a practical Realistic Book implementation with conventional formats (HTML and PDF) and with physical books.

Seventeen experts from nine cultural heritage institutes in the Netherlands were interviewed and asked to answer questionnaires about their daily search activities. The interviews helped us to better understand their search motivations, types, sources and tools. A key finding of our study is that the majority of search tasks involve relatively complex information gathering. This is in contrast to the relatively simple fact-finding oriented support provided by current tools. We describe a number of strategies that experts have developed to overcome the inadequacies of their tools. Finally, based on the analysis, we derive general trends of cultural heritage experts' information seeking needs and discuss our preliminary experiences with potential solutions.},

In this paper, we present the results of a four-week longitudinal study investigating the use of both exploratory and keyword forms of search within an online video archive, where both forms of search were available concurrently in a single user interface. While we expected early use to be more exploratory and subsequent use to be directed, over the whole period there was a balance of exploratory and keyword searches and they were often used together. Further, to support the notion that facets support exploration, there were more than five times as many facet clicks than more complex forms of keyword search (boolean and advanced). From these results, we can conclude that there is real value in investing in exploratory search support, which was shown to be both popular and useful for extended use of the system.},

abstract = {The growing availability of online K-12 curriculum is increasing the need for meaningful alignment of this curriculum with state-specific standards. Promising automated and semi-automated alignment tools have recently become available. Unfortunately, recent alignment evaluation studies report low inter-rater reliability, e.g., 32% with two raters and 35 documents. While these results are in line with studies in other domains, low reliability makes it difficult to accurately train automatic systems and complicates comparison of different services. We propose that inter-rater reliability of broadly defined, abstract concepts such as 'alignment' or 'relevance' must be expected to be low due to the real-world complexity of teaching and the multidimensional nature of the curricular documents. Hence, we suggest decomposing these concepts into less abstract, more precise measures anchored in the daily practice of teaching.This article reports on the integration of automatic alignment results into the interface of the Teach Engineering collection and on an evaluation methodology intended to produce more consistent document relevance ratings. Our results (based on 14 raters x 6 documents) show high inter-rater reliability (61 - 95%) on less abstract relevance dimensions while scores on the overall 'relevance' concept are (as expected) lower (64%). Despite a relatively small sample size, regression analysis of our data resulted in an explanatory (R2 = .75) and statistically stable (p-values &lt; .05) model for overall relevance as indicated by matching concepts, related background material, adaptability to grade level, and anticipated usefulness of exercises. Our results suggest that more detailed relevance evaluation which includes several dimensions of relevance would produce better data for comparing and training alignment tools.},

Like overlay journals or the information network overlay model, our curriculum overlay model defines curriculum as a compound object with internal semantic relationships and relationships to digital library metadata describing resources. We validated this model by instantiating the model using science curriculum which uses digital library resources and using this instantiation within an application that, built on FEDORA, supports curriculum customization. Findings from this work can support the design of digital library services for customizing curriculum which embeds digital resources.},

Here we present and evaluate a new automated technique for creating and enriching a geographical gazetteer, called Gazetiki. Our technique merges disparate information from Wikipedia, Panoramio, and web search engines in order to identify geographical names, categorize these names, find their geographical coordinates and rank them. The information produced in Gazetiki enhances and complements the Geonames database, using a similar domain model. We show that our method provides a richer structure and an improved coverage compared to another known attempt at automatically building a geographic database and, where possible, we compare our Gazetiki to Geonames.},

A source is considered relevant if it contains data that matches the keywords in the specified region.

Such approaches result in poor search results, often missing the most relevant sources on the web. We address this problem by developing more meaningful summaries of GIS datasets that preserve the spatial distribution of keywords. We conduct experiments showing the effectiveness of proposed summarization techniques by significantly improving the quality of query results over baseline approaches, while guaranteeing scalability and high performance.},

But the increasing reliance on this "social Web" also places individuals and their computer systems at risk, creating opportunities for malicious participants to exploit the tight social fabric of these networks. With these problems in mind, we propose the SocialTrust framework for tamper-resilient trust establishment in online communities. SocialTrust provides community users with dynamic trust values by (i) distinguishing relationship quality from trust; (ii) incorporating a personalized feedback mechanism for adapting as the community evolves; and (iii) tracking user behavior. We experimentally evaluate the SocialTrust framework using real online social networking data consisting of millions of MySpace profiles and relationships. We find that SocialTrust supports robust trust establishment even in the presence of large-scale collusion by malicious participants.},

Backup, common practice of home users, avoids the physical loss of data, but it does not prevent the loss of the ability to render and use the data in the long term. Research and development in the area of digital preservation is driven by memory institutions and large businesses. The available tools, services and models are developed to meet the demands of these professional settings.This paper analyses the requirements and challenges of preservation solutions for private users and SOHOs. Based on the requirements and supported by available tools and services, we are designing and implementing a home archiving system to provide digital preservation solutions specifically for digital holdings in the small office and home environment. It hides the technical complexity of digital preservation challenges and provides simple and automated services based on established best practice examples. The system combines bit preservation and logical preservation strategies to avoid loss of data and the ability to access and use them. A first software prototype, called Hoppla, is presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Our previous research has shown that the collective behavior of search engine caches (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Live Search) and web archives (e.g., Internet Archive) results in the uncoordinated but large-scale refreshing and migrating of web resources. Interacting with these caches and archives, which we call the Web Infrastructure (WI), allows entire websites to be reconstructed in an approach we call lazy preservation. Unfortunately, the WI only captures the client-side view of a web resource. While this may be useful for recovering much of the content of a website, it is not helpful for restoring the scripts, web server configuration, databases, and other server-side components responsible for the construction of the website's resources.This paper proposes a novel technique for storing and recovering the server-side components of a website from the WI. Using erasure codes to embed the server-side components as HTML comments throughout the website, we can effectively reconstruct all the server components of a website when only a portion of the client-side resources have been extracted from the WI. We present the results of a preliminary study that baselines the lazy preservation of ten EPrints repositories and then examines the preservation of an EPrints repository that uses the erasure code technique to store the server-side EPrints software throughout the website. We found nearly 100% of the EPrints components were recoverable from the WI just two weeks after the repository came online, and it remained recoverable four months after it was "lost".},

abstract = {The National Geospatial Digital Archive, one of eight initial projects funded under the Library of Congress's NDIIPP program, has been researching how geospatial data can be preserved on a national scale and be made available to future generations. In this paper we describe an archive architecture that provides a minimal approach to the long-term preservation of digital objects based on co-archiving of object semantics, uniform representation of objects and semantics, explicit storage of all objects and semantics as files, and abstraction of the underlying storage system. This architecture ensures that digital objects can be easily migrated from archive to archive over time and that the objects can, in principle, be made usable again at any point in the future; its primary benefit is that it serves as a fallback strategy against, and as a foundation for, more sophisticated (and costly) preservation strategies. We describe an implementation of this architecture in a protoype archive running at UCSB that also incorporates a suite of ingest and access components.},

abstract = {Data visualization has historically been accessible only to the technological elite. It is, after all, "serious" technology done by experts for experts. But recent web-based visualizations - ranging from political art projects to news stories - have reached millions. Unfortunately, while lay users can view sophisticated visualizations, they have few ways to create them. In order to "democratize" visualization, we have built Many Eyes, a web site where people may upload their own data, create interactive visualizations, and carry on conversations. By making these tools available to anyone on the web, the site fosters a social style of data analysis that empowers users to engage with public data through discussion and collaboration. Political discussions, citizen activism, religious conversations, game playing, and educational exchanges are all happening on Many Eyes. The public nature of these visualizations provides users with a transformative path to information literacy.},

abstract = {Collaborative, social tagging and annotation systems have exploded on the Internet as part of the Web 2.0 phenomenon. Systems such as Flickr, Del.icio.us, Technorati, Connotea and LibraryThing, provide a community-driven approach to classifying information and resources on the Web, so that they can be browsed, discovered and re-used. Although social tagging sites provide simple, user-relevant tags, there are issues associated with the quality of the metadata and the scalability compared with conventional indexing systems. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that enables authoritative metadata generated by traditional cataloguing methods to be merged with community annotations and tags. The HarvANA (Harvesting and Aggregating Networked Annotations) system uses a standardized but extensible RDF model for representing the annotations/tags and OAI-PMH to harvest the annotations/tags from distributed community servers. The harvested annotations are aggregated with the authoritative metadata in a centralized metadata store. This streamlined, interoperable, scalable approach enables libraries, archives and repositories to leverage community enthusiasm for tagging and annotation, augment their metadata and enhance their discovery services. This paper describes the HarvANA system and its evaluation through a collaborative testbed with the National Library of Australia using architectural images from PictureAustralia.},

PaperBase also predicts likely key words for the preprints, based on a controlled vocabulary of keywords that the archive uses and a Bayesian classifier.We have tested the system on 12 individuals, and measured the time that it took them to enter data, and the accuracy of the entered metadata. We find that our system appears to be faster than manual entry, but a larger sample needs to be tested before it can be deemed statistically significant. All but two participants perceived it to be faster. Some metadata, in particular the title of preprints, contains significantly fewer mistakes when entered automatically; even though the automatic system is not perfect, people tend to correct mistakes that paperBase makes, but would leave their own mistakes in place.},

abstract = {Large scale digitization projects have been conducted at digital libraries to preserve cultural artifacts and to provide permanent access. The increasing amount of digitized resources, including scanned books and scientific publications, requires development of tools and methods that will efficiently analyze and manage large collections of digitized resources. In this work, we tackle the problem of extracting metadata from scanned volumes of journals. Our goal is to extract information describing internal structures and content of scanned volumes, which is necessary for providing effective content access functionalities to digital library users. We propose methods for automatically generating volume level, issue level, and article level metadata based on format and text features extracted from OCRed text. We show the performance of our system on scanned bound historical documents nearly two centuries old. We have developed the system and integrated it into an operational digital library, the Internet Archive, for real-world usage.},

abstract = {Key Ideas is a technique for exploring digital libraries by navigating passages that repeat across multiple books. From these popular passages emerge quotations that authors have copied from book to book because they capture an idea particularly well: Jefferson on liberty; Stanton on women's rights; and Gibson on cyberpunk. We augment Popular Passages by extracting key terms from the surrounding context and computing sets of related key terms. We then create an interaction model where readers fluidly explore the library by viewing popular quotations on a particular key term, and follow links to quotations on related key terms. In this paper we describe our vision and motivation for Key Ideas, present an implementation running over a massive, real-world digital library consisting of over a million scanned books, and describe some of the technical and design challenges. The principal contribution of this paper is the interaction model and prototype system for browsing digital libraries of books using key terms extracted from the aggregate context of popularly quoted passages.},

abstract = {Awareness of another's activity is an important aspect of facilitating collaboration between users, enabling an "understanding of the activities of others"[1]. Techniques such as collaborative filtering enable a form of asynchronous awareness, providing recommendations generated from the past activity of a community of users. In this paper we investigate the role of awareness and its effect on search behavior in collaborative multimedia retrieval. We focus on the scenario where two users are searching at the same time on the same task, and via the interface, can see the activity of the other user. The main research question asks: does awareness of another searcher aid a user when carrying out a multimedia search session?To encourage awareness, an experimental study was designed where two users were asked to find as many relevant video shots as possible under different awareness conditions. These were individual search (no awareness of each other), mutual awareness (where both user's could see each other's search screen), and unbalanced awareness (where one user is able to see the other's screen, but not vice-versa). Twelve pairs of users were recruited, and the four worst performing TRECVID 2006 search topics were used as search tasks, under four different awareness conditions. We present the results of this study, followed by a discussion of the implications for multimedia digital library systems.},

However, the formal groundwork to reliably and validly exploit usage data is lacking, and the exact nature, meaning and applicability of usage-based metrics is poorly understood. The MESUR project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation constitutes a systematic effort to define, validate and cross-validate a range of usage-based metrics of scholarly impact. MESUR has collected nearly 1 billion usage events as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data from significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia to construct a large-scale usage data reference set. This paper describes some major challenges related to aggregating and processing usage data, and discusses preliminary results obtained from analyzing the MESUR reference data set. The results confirm the intrinsic value of scholarly usage data, and support the feasibility of reliable and valid usage-based metrics of scholarly impact.},

Twenty-four participants given a treasure-hunt fact-finding task, i.e., very directed search, showed no significant preference for either the still or video treatment, and no difference in task performance. Fourteen participants in a second study worked on an exploratory task in the same within-subjects experimental framework, and showed a significant preference for video. For exploratory work, video has a positive effect on user satisfaction. Implications for use of video in collecting and accessing recorded life oral histories, in student assignments and more generally, are discussed, along with reflections on long term user studies to complement the ones presented here.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of a qualitative field study of the scholarly writing, collaboration, information management, and long-term archiving practices of researchers in five related subdisciplines. The study focuses on the kinds of artifacts the researchers create in the process of writing a paper, how they exchange and store materials over the short term, how they handle references and bibliographic resources, and the strategies they use to guarantee the long term safety of their scholarly materials. The findings reveal: (1) the adoption of a new CIM infrastructure relies crucially on whether it compares favorably to email along six critical dimensions; (2) personal scholarly archives should be maintained as a side-effect of collaboration and the role of ancillary material such as datasets remains to be worked out; and (3) it is vital to consider agency when we talk about depositing new types of scholarly materials into disciplinary repositories.},

abstract = {We describe a user-assisted framework for correcting ink-bleed in old handwritten documents housed at the National Archives of Singapore (NAS). Our approach departs from traditional correction techniques that strive for full automation. Fully-automated approaches make assumptions about ink-bleed characteristics that are not valid for all inputs. Furthermore, fully-automated approaches often have to set algorithmic parameters that have no meaning for the end-user. In our system, the user needs only to provide simple examples of ink-bleed, foreground ink, and background. These training examples are used to classify the remaining pixels in the document to produce a computer-generated result that is equal to or better than existing fully-automated approaches.To offer a complete system, we also provide tools that allow any errors in the computer-generated results to be quickly "cleaned up" by the user. The initial training markup, together with the computer-generated results, and manual edits are all recorded with the final output, allowing subsequent viewers to see how a corrected document was created and to make changes or updates. While an ongoing project, our feedback from the NAS staff has been overwhelmingly positive that this user-assisted framework is a practical way to address the ink-bleed problem.},

Therefore, those creating metadata for digital libraries would appreciate an automatic method to extract such bibliographic data from printed documents. In this paper, we describe an automatic author name tagger for academic articles scanned with optical character recognition (OCR) mark-up. The method uses conditional random fields (CRF) for labeling the unsegmented character strings in authors' blocks as those of either an author or a delimiter. We applied the tagger to Japanese academic articles. The results of the experiments showed that it correctly labeled more than 99% of the author name strings, which compares favorably with the under 96% correct rate of our previous tagger based on a hidden Markov model (HMM).},

abstract = {Most search engines index the textual content of documents in digital libraries. However, scholarly articles frequently report important findings in figures for visual impact and the contents of these figures are not indexed. These contents are often invaluable to the researcher in various fields, for the purposes of direct comparison with their own work. Therefore, searching for figures and extracting figure data are important problems. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no tool to automatically extract data from figures in digital documents. If we can extract data from these images automatically and store them in a database, an end-user can query and combine data from multiple digital documents simultaneously and efficiently. We propose a framework based on image analysis and machine learning to extract information from 2-D plot images and store them in a database. The proposed algorithm identifies a 2-D plot and extracts the axis labels, legend and the data points from the 2-D plot. We also segregate overlapping shapes that correspond to different data points. We demonstrate performance of individual algorithms, using a combination of generated and real-life images.},

By giving a specific form to the distributions of time-varying attributes, we can calculate the similarity between given data and identify objects by using agglomerative clustering on the basis of the similarity. Experiments in which we compared identification accuracies between our proposed method and a method that regards all attribute values as constant showed that the proposed method improves the precision and recall of object identification.},

abstract = {Citations to publication venues in the form of journal, conference and workshop contain spelling variants, acronyms, abbreviated forms and misspellings, all of which make more difficult to retrieve the item of interest. The task of discovering and reconciling these variant forms of bibliographic references is known as authority work. The key goal is to create the so called authority files, which maintain, for any given bibliographic item, a list of variant labels (i.e., variant strings) used as a reference to it. In this paper we propose to use information available on the Web to create high quality publication venue authority files. Our idea is to recognize (and extract) references to publication venues in the text snippets of the answers returned by a search engine. References to a same publication venue are then reconciled in an authority file. Each entry in this file is composed of a canonical name for the venue, an acronym, the venue type (i.e., journal, conference, or workshop), and a mapping to various forms of writing its name in bibliographic citations. Experimental results show that our Web-based method for creating authority files is superior to previous work based on straight string matching techniques. Considering the average precision in finding correct venue canonical names, we observe gains up to 41.7%.},

abstract = {Information on the Internet, especially blog content, changes rapidly. Users of information collections, such as the blogs hosted by technorati.com, have little, if any, control over the content or frequency of these changes. However, it is important for users to be able to monitor content for deviations in the expected pattern of change. If a user is interested in political blogs and a blog switches subjects to a literary review blog, the user would want to know of this change in behavior. Since pages may change too frequently for manual inspection for "unwanted" changes, an automated approach is wanted. In this paper, we explore methods for indentifying unexpected change by using Kalman filters to model blog behavior over time. Using this model, we examine the history of several blogs and determine methods for flagging the significance of a blog's change from one time step to the next. We are able to predict large deviations in blog content, and allow user-defined sensitivity parameters to tune a statistical threshold of significance for deviation from expectation.},

Donor communities have come in to bridge this technology gap by providing funds to university libraries for information technology infrastructure, enabling these university libraries to provide electronic library services to patrons. However, for these services to be utilized effectively, library end-users must accept and use them. To investigate this process in Uganda, this study modifies "The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology" (UTAUT) by replacing "effort expectancy" and "voluntariness" with "relevancy", "awareness" and "benefits" factors. In so doing, we developed the Service Oriented UTAUT (SOUTAUT) model whose dependent constructs predict 133% of the variances in user acceptance and use of e-library services. The study revealed that relevancy moderated by awareness plays a major factor in acceptance and use of e-library services in DCs.},

While the majority of the data will naturally be text, there will also be tens of millions of pages of images. Many of these images will defy automation annotation for the foreseeable future, but a considerable fraction of the images may be amiable to automatic annotation by algorithms that can link the historical image with a modern contemporary, with its attendant metatags. In order to perform this linking we must have a suitable distance measure which appropriately combines the relevant features of shape, color, texture and text. However the best combination of these features will vary from application to application and even from one manuscript to another. In this work we propose a simple technique to learn the distance measure by perturbing the training set in a principled way. We show the utility of our ideas on archives of manuscripts containing images from natural history and cultural artifacts.},

We attempt to improve the recall of text search by automatically assigning appropriate tags to models. Our algorithm finds relevant tags by appealing to a large corpus of partially labeled example models, which does not have to be preclassified or otherwise prepared. For this purpose we use a copy of Google 3DWarehouse, a library of user contributed models which is publicly available on the Internet. Given a model to tag, we find geometrically similar models in the corpus, based on distances in a reduced dimensional space derived from Zernike descriptors. The labels of these neighbors are used as tag candidates for the model with probabilities proportional to the degree of geometric similarity. We show experimentally that text based search for 3D models using our computed tags can approach the quality of geometry based search. Finally, we describe our 3D model search engine that uses this algorithm.},

abstract = {A novel online news extraction approach based on human perception is presented in this paper. The approach simulates how a human perceives and identifies online news content. It first detects news areas based on content function, space continuity, and formatting continuity of news information. It further identifies detailed news content based on the position, format, and semantic of detected news areas. Experiment results show that our approach achieves much better performance (in average more than 99% in terms of F1 Value) compared to previous approaches such as Tree Edit Distance and Visual Wrapper based approaches. Furthermore, our approach does not assume the existence of Web templates in the tested Web pages as required by Tree Edit Distance based approach, nor does it need training sets as required in Visual Wrapper based approach. The success of our approach demonstrates the strength of the perception-oriented Web information extraction methodology and represents a promising approach for automatic information extraction from sources with presentation design for humans.},

abstract = {The fast changes of technologies in today's information landscape have considerably shortened the lifespan of digital objects. Digital preservation has become a pressing challenge. Different strategies such as migration and emulation have been proposed; however, the decision for a specific tool e.g. for format migration or an emulator is very complex. The process of evaluating potential solutions against specific requirements and building a plan for preserving a given set of objects is called preservation planning. So far, it is a mainly manual, sometimes ad-hoc process with little or no tool support. This paper presents a service-oriented architecture and decision support tool that implements a solid preservation planning process and integrates services for content characterisation, preservation action and automatic object comparison to provide maximum support for preservation planning endeavours.},

A batch driven alternative is possible, but requires documents to be converted beforehand into the XML format used by the repository, necessitating a need for programming skills. In contrast, our new scheme allows arbitrary collections of documents residing on the user's computer (or the web at large) to be ingested into a Fedora repository in one operation, without a need for programming expertise. Provision is also made for editing existing documents and metadata, and adding new ones. The documents can be in a wide variety of different formats, and the user interface is suitable for practicing librarians. The design capitalizes on our experience in building the Greenstone librarian interface and participating in dozens of workshops with librarians worldwide.},

Preservation planning aids in this decision making process to find the best preservation strategy considering the institution's requirements, the planning context and possible actions applicable to the objects contained in the repository. Performed manually, this evaluation of possible solutions against requirements takes a good deal of time and effort. In this demonstration, we present Plato, an interactive software tool aimed at creating preservation plans.},

abstract = {Focusing on the intersection of visual data mapping and virtual globe software, this application is part digital library and part analytical tool. It combines data sets into a collaborative database and visualizes the information through Google Earth overlays. This user-centered interface makes previously hard-to-use public information (e.g. census data) accessible and easily interpretable.We are presenting an interactive application named GeoDatum that allows users to upload their databases and display this information through a number of visualization tools, either individually or comparatively. The software is an open source web application with multiple goals. Primarily, it is a central repository for both geographic boundaries and the data related to those boundaries. In addition, it gives users the ability to create dynamic visualizations viewable in Google Earth's extensible KML environment, complete with full 3D renderings and animations. The trade-off is that anyone who wants to use the application to generate visualizations will leave their data for public use.The software's core functionality is to allow users to import their own Shapefiles as well as CSVs containing data about the geographic areas. Shapefiles are an industry standard GIS format supported by numerous software applications including ArcGIS. This software will convert this information into KML files and Google Earth overlays. While it can display publicly available data sets, it also allows a user to include their own information, thus making it a useful internal analytic tool for private interests as well.We will present a case study done with the Brooklyn Public Library that utilizes this tool in the service of a project on urban planning and analysis.},

This workshop, organized by the US Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) will address these questions through presentations and discussion among educators and other interested participants.

In particular, this research supports the hypothesis that interface and design flaws have an effect on the perceived authority and credibility (here defined in terms of being authentic, factual, trustworthy, scholarly, and accurate) of the information being communicated by the interface in question. In short, interface design and the "form" of information (or, alternatively, the messenger) can negatively impact the perception of the quality of the "content" of information (the message).},

Three semantic measures of the tagging content are developed: the level of category references, the changes in category level for each noun as the tagging sequence unfolds, and the scope of concept coverage as the compactness of the WordNet subgraph for the noun senses. Observed patterns of concept reference as a function of sequence position hint at dynamic properties of the tag production process by marking a trace of cognitive activity. If tagging is object categorization, these measures provide a view of the personal categorization behavior of non-professionals and illuminate biases in the production of 'folksonomies' due to tag production processes.},

IsoveraDL allows you to upload and serve your learning resources along with associated record metadata in a very organized and dynamic way.IsoveraDL uses a resource publication workflow that models the existing off-line record management workflow in use by different AAAS BEN partners. In addition IsoveraDL also provides a Peer Review module which allows users to create and use dynamic Peer Review workflows. Using IsoveraDL, permitted users can upload records and metadata for Peer Reviewed by others. Metadata records can be validated by a different set of users before they are published.The record submission forms used in IsoveraDL for adding resources are highly customizable and administrative users have the option of setting up as many of these forms as required. The Controlled Vocabularies and metadata fields used in IsoveraDL conform to AAAS BEN Learning Object Metadata specification. Administrative users have the ability to edit or add to these vocabularies and fields if needed.Optionally, the IsoveraDL Peer Review module may be used in conjunction with IsoveraDL's record submission forms. If a record submission form is set up for Peer Review then all records submitted through the form are Peer Reviewed before they can be validated. Administrative users can create workflows, associated forms and reviewer groups for the Peer Review module. The Peer Review module also has a reporting interface through which administrative users can easily monitor the progress and workload of all records and users associated with the module.Once a record is validated and published, users are able to discover resources through IsoveraDL's search and browse functionality. Records published through IsoveraDL can be easily harvested to the AAAS BEN portal through the built-in Harvester module using OAI-PHM.},

abstract = {The scientific record and the documentary heritage are increasingly created in digital form. The UK based Digital Curation Centre supports institutions who store, manage and preserve such data to help ensure its enhancement and continuing long-term use.The DCC (Digital Curation Centre) Curation Lifecycle Model provides a generic graphical high-level overview of the stages required for successful curation and preservation of digital material from initial conceptualisation. The model can be used to plan curation and preservation activities, to ensure sustainability of repository content or other digital material, within an organisation or consortium. It will help to ensure that all necessary stages are undertaken, each in the correct sequence. The model enables granular functionality to be mapped against it to define roles and responsibilities, and build a framework of standards and technologies to implement. It can help with the process of identifying additional steps which may be required, or actions which are not required by certain situations or disciplines, and of ensuring that processes and policies are adequately documented.Digital Curation Centre staff developed the model before undertaking a period of public consultation, which was recently completed. The newly ratified model will shortly be used by the DCC to ensure that information, services and advisory material cover all areas of the lifecycle. Domain-specific variations of the model will be developed, with greater levels of granularity, to help ensure that advice and information are easily accessible from the website. One planned utilisation is the development of domain specific standards frameworks within the DCC DIFFUSE Standards Frameworks, to help practitioners identify which standards they should be using and where they would be appropriately implemented.This poster will present the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model, incorporating the results of the public consultation period held during December 2007 to February 2008.},

abstract = {The democratization of content creation via ubiquitous Internet tools and infrastructure [1] has fueled an explosion of user-generated content in the commercial and educational markets. Indeed, funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) are actively seeking ways to integrate teachers and learners into the education cyber-infrastructure, whereby they become co-creators of educational content [2].The ease with which this content, often in the form of online learning resources of varying levels of granularity, can be created and disseminated places it outside the usual peer review processes employed by publishers and professional societies. To date, digital library (DL) developers, teachers and school administrators, concerned whether teachers are using peerreviewed online learning resources, have depended on one or a combination of the following proxies to establish an imprimatur of quality: the reputation and oversight of a funding organization (e.g., NSF's peer review process), the credentials of the content creator (e.g., National Science Teachers Association) or the collection development policies of specific DLs (e.g., DLESE).Now more than ever, though, sites such as YouTube, Flickr and ccMixter and the evolving education cyber-infrastructure, have created an environment where user-generated content is beyond the reach of even these proxy review processes. However, in the omnipresent climate of accountability within K12 education at U.S. federal, state and local levels, education DLs are being challenged to identify the value: of the resources they hold and services they provide to users; and, of what their users create with those resources. For all of these reasons, it is useful, and necessary, to develop a standardized rubric and process to review online education resources. In particular, this work should leverage social and technical networks to enrich, facilitate, and automate the review process.The Digital Libraries go to School project was funded by NSF in 2006 to develop a professional development workshop curriculum that enables teachers to use the Instructional Architect (IA; http://ia.usu.edu) to design their own learning activities for classrooms using online STEM resources from the National Science Digital Library (NSDL.org) and the wider Web. One component of the project is to examine the criteria and approaches for reviewing the quality of teacher-created online learning resources in order to develop a rubric and workflow process.Work to date includes conducting focus groups and surveys with teachers and a 5-person Expert Review Committee, complemented by a literature review to identify elements for a review rubric incorporating the work of other education DLs (e.g., DLESE, MERLOT, NEEDS, among others). Findings are being synthesized, and based on analysis, a draft list of elements has been identified for further testing in Spring 2008. At the same time, a workflow process for conducting reviews with teacher-created resources will be piloted. It will combine human-generated reviews with machine-generated information about online resources (e.g., image and word count; educational standards alignment; currency of updates, provenance) [3]. Further work will identify areas for improving the review rubric and scaling and standardizing the workflow process for Fall 2008. We will also evaluate the usefulness of the reviews to teachers, and to stakeholders such as the IA, NSDL, NSF and other DLs, in providing access to high-quality online content.},

abstract = {This poster presentation will reflect qualitatively on the challenges and opportunities of PocketKnowledge (http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php) as an institutional repository.The main question explored is whether such repositories are best understood as new competitors in the academic publishing world or as on-going documentations of the larger intellectual life of the institution. The early experience of one such repository, PocketKnowledge - a social archive developed and implemented by EdLab, a research unit of the Gottesman Libraries, Teachers College Columbia University - reveals that users are motivated not only to participate in an institutional repository, but also to document their intellectual life understood more broadly than publication. This suggests that the latter understanding of an institutional repository is a more reasonable, incremental expectation in what is surely an uphill battle against the long-established prestige of publishing in printed academic journals, and that institutional repositories such as PocketKnowledge should consider the strategic addition of functionalities that can highlight the intellectual life of the institution, not simply the intellectual production of its members.},

abstract = {Bibliographic metadata plays a key role in scientific literature, not only to summarise and establish the facts of the publication record, but also to track citations between publications and hence to establish the impact of individual articles within the literature. Commercial secondary publishers have typically taken on the role of rekeying, mining and analysing this huge corpus of linked data, but as the primary literature has moved to the world of the digital repository, this task is now undertaken by new services such as Citeseer, Citebase or Google Scholar. As institutional and subject-based repositories proliferate and Open Access mandates increase, more of the literature will become openly available in well managed data islands containing a much greater amount of detailed bibliometric metadata in formats such as RDF. Through the use of efficient extraction and inference techniques, complex relations between data items can be established. In this paper we explain the importance of the co-relation in enabling new techniques to rate the impact of a paper or author within a large corpus of publications.},

abstract = {The recent increase of online video has challenged the research in the field of video information retrieval. Video search engines are becoming more and more interactive, helping the user to easily find what he or she is looking for. In this poster, we present a new approach of using an iterative clustering algorithm on text and visual features to simulate users creating new facets in a facet-based interface. Our experimental results prove the usefulness of such an approach.},

abstract = {The H.W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science (Odum), the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), and the School of Information and Library Science (SILS), all part of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), are collaborating with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) on an extension of the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) transcontinental persistent archive prototype (TPAP) data grid with the new integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS). The goal of the project is to enable collection interoperability between UNC-CH and SDSC using an iRODS environment. This poster presents the results of one part of that project, which is the development of a crosswalk between the Odum Institute Data Archive (OIDA) Data Document Initiative (DDI) metadata and the NARA TPAP iRODS metadata catalogue (iCAT) via the OAI-PMH.},
