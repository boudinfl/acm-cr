abstract = {The availability of map interfaces and location-aware devices makes a growing amount of unstructured, geo-referenced information available on the Web. This type of information can be valuable not only for browsing, finding and making sense of individual items, but also in aggregate form to help understand data trends and features. In particular, over twenty million geo-referenced photos are now available on Flickr, a photo-sharing website - the first major collection of its kind. These photos are often associated with user-entered unstructured text labels (i.e., tags). We show how we analyze the tags associated with the geo-referenced Flickr images to generate aggregate knowledge in the form of "representative tags" for arbitrary areas in the world. We use these tags to create a visualization tool, World Explorer, tha tcan help expose the content of the data, using a map interface to display the derived tags and the original photo items. We perform a qualitative evaluation of World Explorer that outlines the visualization's benefits in browsing this type of content. We provide insights regarding the aggregate versus individual-item requirements in browsing digital geo-referenced material.},

abstract = {Digital libraries (DLs) for online discourse contain large amounts of valuable information that is difficult to navigate and analyze. Visualization systems developed to facilitate improved CMC archive analysis and navigation primarily focus on interaction information, with little emphasis on textual content. In this paper we present a system that provides DL exploration services such as visualization, categorization, and analysis for CMC text. The system incorporates an extended feature set comprised of stylistic, topical, and sentiment related features to enable richer content representation. The system also includes the Ink Blot technique which utilizes decision tree models and text overlay to visualize CMC messages. Ink Blots can be used for text categorization and analysis across forums, authors, threads, messages, and over time. The proposed system's analysis capabilities were evaluated with a series of examples and a qualitative user study. Empirical categorization experiments comparing the Ink Blot technique against a benchmark support vector machine classifier were also conducted. The results demonstrated the efficacy of the Ink Blot technique for text categorization and also highlighted the effectiveness of the extended feature set for improved text categorization.},

abstract = {Identifying the significance of specific concepts in the diffusion of scientific knowledge is a challenging issue concerning many theoretical and practical areas. We introduce an innovative visual analytic approach to integrate microscopic and macroscopic perspectives of a rapidly growing scientific knowledge domain. Specifically, our approach focuses on statistically unexpected phrases extracted from unstructured text of titles and abstracts at the microscopic level in association with the magnitude and timeliness of their citation impact at the macroscopic level. The H-index, originally defined to measure individual scientists. productivity in terms of their citation profiles, is extended in two ways: 1) to papers and terms as a means of dividing these items into two groups so as to replace the less optimal threshold-based divisions, and 2) to take into account the timeliness of the impact of knowledge diffusion in terms of the timing of citations and publications so that attention is particularly drawn towards potentially significant and timely papers. The selected terms are connected to higher-level performance indicators, such as measures derived from the H-index, in the form of decision trees. A top-down traversal of such decision trees provides an intuitive walkthrough of concepts and phrases that may underline potentially significant but currently still latent scientific discoveries. Timeliness measures can also help to identify institutions that are at the forefront of a research field. We illustrate how widely accessible tools such as Google Earth can be utilized to disseminate such insights. The practical significance for digital libraries and fostering scientific discoveries is demonstrated through the astronomical literature related to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).},

A range of tools exists today to support the variety of preservation strategies such as migration or emulation. Yet, different preservation requirements across institutions and settings make the decision on which solution to implement very diffcult.This paper presents the PLANETS Preservation Planning approach. It provides an approved way to make informed and accountable decisions on which solution to implement in order to optimally preserve digital objects for a given purpose. It is based on Utility Analysis to evaluate the performance of various solutions against well-defined requirements and goals. The viability of this approach is shown in a range of case studies for different settings. We present its application to two scenarios of web archives, two collections of electronic publications, and a collection of multimedia art. This work focuses on the different requirements and goals in the various preservation settings.},

In this paper we describe an experiment where we crawled and reconstructed 300 randomly selected websites on a weekly basis for 14 weeks. The reconstructions were performed using our web-repository crawler named Warrick which recovers missing resources from the Web Infrastructure (WI), the collective preservation effort of web archives and search engine caches. We examine several characteristics of the websites over time including birth rate, decay and age of resources. We evaluate the reconstructions when compared to the crawled sites and develop a statistical model for predicting reconstruction success from the WI. On average, we were able to recover 61% of each website's resources. We found that Google's PageRank, number of hops and resource age were the three most significant factors in determining if a resource would be recovered from the WI.},

We have adapted an Apache web server implementation of OAI-PMH which can utilize third-party metadata analysis tools to provide a metadata-rich description of each resource. The resource and its forensic metadata are packaged together as a complex object, expressed in plain ASCII and XML. The result is a CRATE: a self-contained preservation-ready version of the resource, created at time of dissemination.},

This method combines modified physics algorithms with traditional information retrieval techniques. A term network is generated from the document collection, the terms are clustered into small world communities, the semantic term clusters are used to generate overlapping document clusters. The algorithm combines the speed of single link with the quality of complete link. Clustering takes place in nearly real-time and the results are judged to be coherent by expert users. Our algorithm occupies a middle ground between speed and quality of document clustering.},

abstract = {News portals gather and organize news articles published daily on the Internet. Typically, news articles are clustered into 'events' and each cluster is displayed with a short description of its contents. A particularly interesting choice for describing the contents of a cluster is a machine-generated multi-document summary of the articles in the cluster. Such summaries are informative and help news readers to identify and explore only clusters of interest. Naturally, multi-document clusters and summaries are also valuable to help users navigate the results of keyword-search queries. Unfortunately, current document summarizers are still slow; as a result, search strategies that define document clusters and their multi-document summaries online, in a query-specific manner, are prohibitively expensive. In contrast, search strategies that only return offline, query-independent document clusters are efficient, but might return clusters whose (query-independent) summaries are of little relevance to the queries. In this paper, we present an efficient Hybrid search strategy to address the limitations of fully online and fully offline summarization-aware search approaches. Extensive experiments involving user relevance judgments and real news articles show that the quality of our Hybrid results is high, and that these results are computed in substantially less time than with the fully online strategy. We have implemented our strategy and made it available on the Newsblaster news summarization system, which crawls and summarizes news articles from a variety of web sources on a daily basis.},

For resource discovery, we have bootstrapped our collection building process using metadata from DBLP and CiteSeer. For alignment, we modify maximum similarity alignment to favor monotonic alignments and incorporate a classifier to handle slides which should not be aligned. For the user interface, we allow the user to seamlessly switch between four carefully motivated views of the resulting synchronized media pairs.},

abstract = {Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents, tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each ⃭query, tableℂ pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents.},

In this paper, we explore the concept of an enhanced search, in which data from social bookmarking systems is exploited for enhancing search in the Web. We propose combining the widely used link-based ranking metric with the one derived using social bookmarking data. First, this increases the precision of a standard link-based search by incorporating popularity estimates from aggregated data of bookmarking users. Second, it provides an opportunity for extending the search capabilities of existing search engines. Individual contributions of bookmarking users as well as the general statistics of their activities are used here for a new kind of a complex search where contextual, temporal or sentiment-related information is used. We investigate the usefulness of social bookmarking systems for the purpose of enhancing Web search through a series of experiments done on datasets obtained from social bookmarking systems. Next, we show the prototype system that implements the proposed approach and we present some preliminary results.},

abstract = {This paper describes a framework to annotate images using personal and social network contexts. The problem is important as the correct context reduces the number of image annotation choices.. Social network context is useful as real-world activities of members of the social network are often correlated within a specific context. The correlation can serve as a powerful resource to effectively increase the ground truth available for annotation. There are three main contributions of this paper: (a) development of an event context framework and definition of quantitative measures for contextual correlations based on concept similarity in each facet of event context; (b) recommendation algorithms based on spreading activations that exploit personal context as well as social network context; (c) experiments on real-world, everyday images that verified both the existence of inter-user semantic disagreement and the improvement in annotation when incorporating both the user and social network context. We have conducted two user studies, and our quantitative and qualitative results indicate that context (both personal and social) facilitates effective image annotation.},

Existing works have typically focused on generic web workloads without putting emphasis on specific domains. In this paper, we analyze the usage logs of CiteSeer, a scientific literature digital library and search engine, to characterize workloads for both robots and users. Essential ingredients that contribute to workloads are proposed. Among them we find the access intervals show high variance, and thus cannot be predicted well with time-series models. On the other hand, client visiting path and semantics can be well captured with probabilistic models and Zipf-law. Based on the findings, we propose SearchGen, a synthetic workload generator to output traces for scientific literature digital libraries and search engines. A comparison between synthetic workloads and actual logged traces suggests that the synthetic workload fits well.},

abstract = {The archival community has developed content and data structure standards to facilitate access to the diverse and unique sets of archival records, personal papers, and manuscript collections that are held by archival repositories and special collections libraries. However, these standards are difficult for archivists to use and are often implemented in ways that negatively affect materials-handling workflows, depriving archival users of the best possible access to the totality of materials available within an individual repository. The authors propose that archival descriptive problems can be addressed by implementing a web/database application that is tailored specifically to archival needs and can be implemented with little technical knowledge. This paper describes the system architecture of one such tool, the Archon software package, which was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Archon automates many technical tasks, such as producing a searchable website, an EAD instance or a MARC record. Although the system utilizes sophisticated algorithms and optimizations, it is easily extensible because most development takes place in an easy-to-use, object-oriented environment.},

Aligning standards from different states promises to help teachers in one state find appropriate materials created and cataloged elsewhere. Although such alignments provide a powerful means for crosswalking standards and curriculum across states, alignment matrices are intrinsically sparse. Hence, we hypothesize that such sparseness may cause significant numbers of false negatives when used for searching curriculum. Our preliminary results confirm the false negative hypothesis, demonstrate the usefulness of term-based techniques in addressing the false negative problem, and explore ways to combine term occurrence data with standards correlations.},

abstract = {Traditionally, record linkage algorithms have played an important role in maintaining digital libraries - i.e., identifying matching citations or authors for consolidation in updating or integrating digital libraries. As such, a variety of record linkage algorithms have been developed and deployed successfully. Often, however, existing solutions have a set of parameters whose values are set by human experts off-lineand are fixed during the execution. Since finding the ideal values of such parameters is not straightforward, or no such single ideal value even exists, the applicability of existing solutions to new scenarios or domains is greatly hampered. To remedy this problem, we argue that one can achieve significant improvement by adaptively and dynamically changing such parameters of record linkage algorithms. To validate our hypothesis, we take a classical record linkage algorithm, the sorted neighborhood method (SNM), and demonstrate how we can achieve improved accuracy and performance by adaptively changing its fixed sliding window size. Our claim is analytically and empirically validated using both real and synthetic data sets of digital libraries and other domains.},

Derivation of a maximum number, which is proportional to the subcollection size but not sensitive to different search topics, is made possible by an analysis of patterns of relevance judgment across approximately 17,000 web hosts in GOV2.},

abstract = {Entity resolution is a very common Information Quality (IQ) problem with many different applications. In digital libraries, it is related to problems of citation matching and author name disambiguation; in Natural Language Processing, it is related to coreference matching and object identity; in Web application, it is related to Web page disambiguation. The problem of Entity Resolution arises because objects/entities in real world datasets are often referred to by descriptions, which might not be unique identifiers of these entities, leading to ambiguity. The goal is to group all the entity descriptions that refer to the same real world entities. In this paper we present a graphical approach for entity resolution. It complements the traditional methodology with the analysis of the entity-relationship graph constructed for the dataset being analyzed. The paper demonstrates that a technique that measures the degree of interconnectedness between various pairs of nodes in the graph can significantly improve the quality of entity resolution. Furthermore, the paper presents an algorithm for making that technique self-adaptive to the underlying data, thus minimizing the required participation from the domain-analyst and potentially further improving the disambiguation quality.},

Differently from related approaches that rely on manually built knowledge-bases (KBs) for recognizing the components of a citation, in our case, such a KB is automatically constructed from an existing set of sample metadata records from a given area (e.g., computer science or health sciences). Our approach does not rely on patterns encoding specific delimitators of a particular citation style. It is also unsupervised, in the sense that it does not rely on a learning method that requires a training phase. These features assign to our technique a high degree of automation and flexibility. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed approach we have run experiments in which we applied it to extract information from citations in papers of two different domains. Results of these experiments indicate precision and recall levels above 94% and perfect extraction for the large majority of citations tested.},

abstract = {Bibliometrics are important measures for venue quality in digital libraries. Impacts of venues are usually the major consideration for subscription decision-making, and for ranking and recommending high-quality venues and documents. For digital libraries in the Computer Science literature domain, conferences play a major role as an important publication and dissemination outlet. However, with a recent profusion of conferences and rapidly expanding fields, it is increasingly challenging for researchers and librarians to assess the quality of conferences. We propose a set of novel heuristics to automatically discover prestigious (and low-quality) conferences by mining the characteristics of Program Committee members. We examine the proposed cues both in isolation and combination under a classification scheme. Evaluation on a collection of 2,979 conferences and 16,147 PC members shows that our heuristics, when combined, correctly classify about 92% of the conferences, with a low false positive rate of 0.035 and a recall of more than 73% for identifying reputable conferences. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that our heuristics can also effectively detect a set of low-quality conferences, with a false positive rate of merely 0.002. We also report our experience of detecting two previously unknown low-quality conferences. Finally, we apply the proposed techniques to the entire quality spectrum by ranking conferences in the collection.},

The development of large-scale digital libraries and the availability of various meta data provide the possibility of building new measures more efficiently and accurately. In this work, we propose two novel measures for ranking the impacts of academic venues an easy-to-implement seed-based measure that does not use citation analysis, and a realistic browsing-based measure that takes an article reader's behavior into account. Both measures are computationally efficient yet mimic the results of the widely accepted Impact Factor. In particular, our proposal exploits the fact that: (1)in most disciplines, there are "top" venues that most people agree on; and (2) articles that appeared in good venues are more likely to be viewed by readers. Our proposed measures are extensively evaluated on a test case of the Database research community using two real bibliography data sets - ACM and DBLP. Finally, ranks of venues by our proposed measures are compared against the Impact Factor using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and their positive rank order relationship is proved with a statistical significance test.},

abstract = {This paper studies the challenge of representing aggregate works such as encyclopedias, collected poems and journals in heterogenous digital library collections. Reflecting on the materials used by humanities academics, we demonstrate the varied range of aggregate types and the problems of faithfully representing this in the DL interface. Aggregates are complex and pervasive, challenge common assumptions and confuse boundaries within organisational structures. Existing DL systems can only provide imperfect representation of aggregates, and alterations to document encoding are insufficient to create a faithful reproduction of the physical library. The challenge is amplified through concrete examples, and solutions are demonstrated in a well-known DL system and related to standard DL architecture.},

Traditional newspapers have developed significant web presences to compete with newer services such as news aggregators and emerging genres such as blogs and other forms of citizen journalism. This paper reports the results of a field study to investigate the use of a new RSS-driven, template-based presentation mechanism that delivers a daily newspaper to subscribers' laptops and desktops; the Times News Reader hybridizes elements of print newspapers with aspects of online news. We explore how this application compares with print and web-based news reading and evaluate functionality developed to draw in readers from both audiences. Finally we examine three general technological implications drawn from current use: how the news reader may adapt to different styles of reading; how the news reader's functionality may be extended to highlight the timeliness of the content and to personalize the application; and how long-term use of the news reader can result in a personal news archive.},

abstract = {New technologies for scientific research are producing a deluge of data that is overwhelming traditional tools for data capture, analysis, storage, and access. We report on a study of scientific practices associated with dynamic deployments of embedded sensor networks to identify requirements for data digital libraries. As part of continuing research on scientific data management, we interviewed 22 participants in 5 environmental science projects to identify data types and uses, stages in their data life cycle, and requirements for digital library architecture. We found that scientists need continuous access to their data from the time that field experiments are designed through final analysis and publication, thus reflecting a broader notion of "digital library." Six categories of requirements are discussed: the ability to obtain and maintain data in the field, verify data in the field, document data context for subsequent interpretation, integrate data from multiple sources, analyze data, and preserve data. Three digital library efforts currently underway within the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing are addressing these requirements, with the goal of a tightly coupled interoperable framework that, in turn, will be a component of cyberinfrastructure for science.},

The real world instantiation of the presented abstract ontology is a semantic network model of the scholarly community which lends the scholarly process to statistical analysis and computational support. We present the ontology, discuss its instantiation, and provide some example inference rules for calculating various scholarly artifact metrics.},

abstract = {The successful deployment of digital technologies by humanities scholars presents computer scientists with a number of unique scientific and technological challenges. The task seems particularly daunting because issues in the humanities are presented in abstract language demanding the kind of subtle interpretation often thought to be beyond the scope of artificial intelligence, and humanities scholars themselves often disagree about the structure of their disciplines. The future of humanities computing depends on having tools for automatically discovering complex semantic relationships among different parts of a corpus. Digital library tools for the humanities will need to be capable of dynamically tracking the introduction of new ideas and interpretations and applying them to older texts in ways that support the needs of scholars and students.This paper describes the design of new algorithms and the adjustment of existing algorithms to support the automated and semi-automated management of domain-rich metadata for an established digital humanities project, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Our approach starts with a "hand-built" formal ontology that is modified and extended by a combination of automated and semi-automated methods, thus becoming a "dynamic ontology". We assess the suitability of current information retrieval and information extraction methods for the task of automatically maintaining the ontology. We describe a novel measure of term-relatedness that appears to be particularly helpful for predicting hierarchical relationships in the ontology. We believe that our project makes a further contribution to information science by being the first to harness the collaboration inherent in a expert-maintained dynamic reference work to the task of maintaining and verifying a formal ontology. We place special emphasis on the task of bringing domain expertise to bear on all phases of the development and deployment of the system, from the initial design of the software and ontology to its dynamic use in a fully operational digital reference work.},

Also analyzed are the underlying digitization principles and standards, and metadata schemas for the description and exchange of digital objects which facilitate record exchange and improve audience reach.The paper provides an overview of some individual contributing institutions, however particular focus is placed on the State Library of Queensland's (SLQ) approach to preparing its unique Queensland music collection for digital resource discovery in MusicAustralia. A detailed analysis of SLQ's strategy is presented, including its risk management approach to copyright implications,and consideration of infrastructure issues affecting the creation, preservation and online delivery of its digital music objects.Whilst SLQ's current digital music collection is relatively small, it has become core business of SLQ's Arts and Humanities branch, and the collection will expand with the continued incorporation of music material unique to Queensland into the collection. SLQ has developed a sound foundation for digitization based on widely endorsed principles and standards which should allow this to effectively occur.},

The first resulted in a significant improvement to the feature extraction function for these images. The second is a goal-directed comparison of several popular adaptive binarization algorithms, which are often evaluated only subjectively.

We provide the first in depth quantitative analysis of the results produced by the Google, MSN and Yahoo API and WUI interfaces. We have queried both interfaces for five months and found significant discrepancies between the interfaces in several categories. In general, we found MSN to produce the most consistent results between their two interfaces. Our findings suggest that the API indexes are not older, but they are probably smaller for Google and Yahoo. We also examined how search results decay over time and built predictive models based on the observed decay rates. Based on our findings, it can take over a year for half of the top 10 results to a popular query to be replaced in Google and Yahoo; for MSN it may take only 2-3 months.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of disambiguating person names within web pages and scientific documents. We present an efficient and effective two-stage approach to disambiguate names. In the first stage, two novel topic-based models are proposed by extending two hierarchical Bayesian text models, namely Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our models explicitly introduce a new variable for persons and learn the distribution of topics with regard to persons and words. After learning an initial model, the topic distributions are treated as feature sets and names are disambiguated by leveraging a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. Experiments on web data and scientific documents from CiteSeer indicate that our approach consistently outperforms other unsupervised learning methods such as spectral clustering and DBSCAN clustering and could be extended to other research fields. We empirically addressed the issue of scalability by disambiguating authors in over 750,000 papers from the entire CiteSeer dataset.},

We hypothesize that digital libraries of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) are a good source of technical phrase translations. We have acquired a collection of 3,086 Spanish ETDs about computer science from Scirus, the Universidad Nacional Aut\'{o}noma de M\'{e}xico (Mexico City), and Universidad de las Am\'{e}ricas (Puebla).

abstract = {While digital libraries based on page images and automatically generated text have made possible massive projects such as the Million Book Library, Open Content Alliance, Google, and others, humanists still depend upon textual corpora expensively produced with labor-intensive methods such as double-keyboarding and manual correction. This paper reports the results from an analysis of OCR-generated text for classical Greek source texts. Classicists have depended upon specialized manual keyboarding that costs two or more times as much as keyboarding of English both for accuracy and because classical Greek OCR produced no usable results. We found that we could produce texts by OCR that, in some cases, approached the 99.95% professional data entry accuracy rate. In most cases, OCR-generated text yielded results that, by including the variant readings that digital corpora traditionally have left out, provide better recall and, we argue, can better serve many scholarly needs than the expensive corpora upon which classicists have relied for a generation. As digital collections expand, we will be able to collate multiple editions against each other, identify quotations of primary sources, and provide a new generation of services.},

Having uniform, consistent and enriched subject metadata allows users to more easily discover material, browse the collection, and limit keyword search results by subject. We demonstrate how statistical topic models are useful for subject metadata enrichment. We describe some of the challenges of metadata enrichment on a huge scale (10 million metadata records from 700 repositories in the OAIster Digital Library) when the metadata is highly heterogeneous (metadata about images and text, and both cultural heritage material and scientific literature). We show how to improve the quality of the enriched metadata, using both manual and statistical modeling techniques. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges of the production environment, and demonstrate the value of the enriched metadata in a prototype portal.},

abstract = {Large scale library digitization projects such as the Open Content Alliance are producing vast quantities of text, but little has been done to organize this data. Subject headings inherited from card catalogs are useful but limited, while full-text indexing is most appropriate for readers who already know exactly what they want. Statistical topic models provide a complementary function. These models can identify semantically coherent "topics" that are easily recognizable and meaningful to humans, but they have been too computationally intensive to run on library-scale corpora. This paper presents DCM-LDA, a topic model based on Dirichlet Compound Multinomial distributions. This model is simultaneously better able to represent observed properties of text and more scalable to extremely large text collections. We train individual topic models for each book based on the cooccurrence of words within pages. We then cluster topics across books. The resulting topical clusters can be interpreted as subject facets, allowing readers to browse the topics of a collection quickly, find relevant books using topically expanded keyword searches, and explore topical relationships between books. We demonstrate this method finding topics on a corpus of 1.49 billion words from 42,000 books in less than 20 hours, and it easily could scale well beyond this.},

abstract = {With the increasing focus on interoperability for distributed digital content, resource developers need to take into consideration how they will contribute to large federated collections, potentially at the national and international level. At the same time, their primary objectives are usually to meet the needs of their own institutions and user communities. This tension between local practices and needs and the more global potential of digital collections has been an object of study for the IMLS Digital Collections and Content (IMLS DCC) project. Our practical aim has been to provide integrated access to over 160 IMLS-funded digital collections through a centralized collection registry and metadata repository. During the course of development, the research team has investigated how collections and items can best be represented to meet the needs of local resource developers and aggregators of distributed content, as well as the diverse user communities they may serve. This paper presents results from a longitudinal analysis of IMLS DCC development trends between 2003 and 2006. Changes in metadata applications have not been pronounced. However, multi-scheme use has become less common, and use of Dublin Core remains high, even as recognition of its limitations grows. Locally developed schemes are used as much as MARC, and may be on the increase as new collections are incorporating less traditional library and museum materials, and more interactive and multimedia content. Based on our empirical understanding of metadata use in practice, patterns in new content development, and user community indicators, our research has turned toward identifying metadata relationships between items and collections to preserve context and enhance functionality and usefulness for scholarly user communities.},

We adopt a kernel-based approach and design kernel functions to capture content information and various citation-related information in patents. These kernels. performances are evaluated on a testbed of patents related to nanotechnology. Evaluation results show that our proposed labeled citation graph kernel, which utilized citation network structures, significantly outperforms the kernels that use no citation information or only direct citation information.},

abstract = {Blogs have emerged as valuable records of current social and political events. In response, calls in the literature have advocated that these new vehicles of communication and information dissemination are valuable additions to the human record worthy of stewardship [1,2,3]. The intent of this research is to study the requirements and feasibility of impacting stewardship of blogs at the level of creation. This will be accomplished by surveying blogger perceptions on digital preservation. Expected outcomes of this study include the development of a framework for constructing a digital preservation program for blogs.A survey will be administered to bloggers to assess perceptions of digital preservation issues as related to their own blogging activities and the blogosphere in general. The instrument is organized into five categories: demographics, awareness, appraisal, impact, and investment. Participants will be recruited through established contacts in the blogging community, with the intent of a resulting snowball effect for gathering additional participation.The demographics section collects basic characteristics of respondents, characteristics of their blogs (e.g., topic areas, platforms, linkages, content types, permissions for reuse), and their blogging practices (e.g., motivations, frequency of updates). The awareness section surveys current preservation-related activities performed by bloggers such as measures taken to ensure duplication of blog content; and whether, why, and how bloggers engage in practices that result in post-publication content changes. The appraisal section assesses perceptions of issues related to persistent storage and access. Respondents are asked to evaluate the importance of researcher-supplied blog characteristics that could be used to appraise blogs and their components. These characteristics include social and cultural factors such as perceived blog popularity, social linkages, and artifactual significance as well as structural components and content types. In addition to seeking clarification of the types and components of blogs that are perceived to be important with respect to preservation, the appraisal section addresses issues related to content ownership. The impact section focuses on the perceived importance of blogs to authors, preserving access to blogs, and blogs as a part of the human record. In the investment section, respondents are asked to quantify resources that they would be willing to expend to preserve their own blogs and their willingness to extend these expenditures to the blogs of others.Data collection will begin April 2007 and continue for one month. Following closure of the survey, data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative evaluation methods. An initial assessment report will include a summary analysis of results and initial calls for recommendations. Future works include further development of these recommendations, development of benchmarks for planning ingest of blogs into a repository system, and the design and pilot testing of a user interface for deposit, storage, and access.This research is intended to promote digital preservation activities for continued access to blogs and to raise awareness of digital preservation issues among a population of users removed from the walls of academia and research. Bloggers constitute a significant producer type in that they have produced culturally and socially significant works, including those that contribute to wider public discourse. Furthermore, bloggers have the potential to become significant contributors to the dissemination of preservation awareness because they are vital actors in networks of communities that often span the borders of institutional, commercial, grassroots and personal communications.},

abstract = {The poster will compare and contrast the design and usage assumptions of existing educational digital libraries and repositories to challenge digital library developers to meet the needs of their increasingly sophisticated users. Traditionally, assumptions have focused on access to a site and discovery of content, whereas we define use as content and its application (context, audience, etc.).In this poster we will review the assumptions that have driven the design of digital libraries, their services and evaluation. Measures of success such as page views of metadata rest on assumptions associated with access, i.e., the number of times a metadata record is displayed. This measure provides a very limited view of how a digital library is used. We believe that educational digital libraries need to go beyond such a limited view and think about what people actually do with material: Are they using it? Are they returning to it? Are they modifying it? Are they sharing it with others? We will explore an alternate set of metrics for determining the success (or failure) of educational digital libraries by examining metrics focused on use of the contents of educational digital libraries.},

In this work, we develop a digital video management system called VCenter, which provides lightweight mobile search functionality based on image taken from camera phone. By the proposed framework, both end user and content owner are easier to enjoy the multimedia contents in digital video libraries.},
