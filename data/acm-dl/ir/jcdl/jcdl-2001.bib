abstract = {With the number and types of documents in digital library systems incr easing, tools for automatically organizing and presenting the content have to be found. While many approaches focus on topic-based organization and structuring, hardly any system incorporates automatic structural analysis and representation. Yet, genre information (unconsciously) forms one of the most distinguishing features in conventional libraries and in information searches. In this paper we present an approach to automatically analyze the structure of documents and to integrate this information into an automatically created content-based organization. In the resulting visualization, documents on similar topics, yet representing different genres, are depicted as books in differing colors. This representation supports users intuitively in locating relevant information presented in a relevant form.},

abstract = {Text categorization is typically formulated as a concept learning prob lem where each instance is a single isolated document. In this paper we are interested in a more general formulation where documents are organized as page sequences, as naturally occurring in digital libraries of scanned books and magazines. We describe a method for classifying pages of sequential OCR text documents into one of several assigned categories and suggest that taking into account contextual information provided by the whole page sequence can significantly improve classification accuracy. The proposed architecture relies on hidden Markov models whose emissions are bag-of-words according to a multinomial word event model, as in the generative portion of the Naive Bayes classifier. Our results on a collection of scanned journals from the Making of America project confirm the importance of using whole page sequences. Empirical evaluation indicates that the error rate (as obtained by running a plain Naive Bayes classifier on isolated page) can be roughly reduced by half if contextual information is incorporated.},

The goal is to redefine the line between those activities that fall within the domain of computer programming and those that fall within the domain of content authoring. The current location of this line, as defined by web technologies, is such that far too much of the design and development process is in the domain of software creation. This paper explores the definition and use of “linked active content”, which builds on the hypertext paradigm by extending it to support active content. This concept has community development advantages, since it provides an authoring paradigm that supports  contributions from a more diverse audience, including especially those who have substantial classroom and pedagogical expertise but lack programming expertise.  It also promotes the extraction of content from software so that collections may be better organized and more easily repurposed to meet the needs of a diverse audience of educators and students.},

Such environments have proved extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult to produce, however, threatening the goals of widespread creation and use. One proposed solution for accelerating production has been the creation of repositories of reusable software components or learning objects. Programmers would use such components to rapidly assemble larger-scale environments. Although many agree on the value of this approach, few repositories of such components have been successfully created. We suggest some reasons for the lack of expected results and propose two strategies for developing such repositories. We report on a case study that provides a proof of concept of these strategies.},

We do this by describing important aspects of legal research in a heterogeneous information environment, including mobility, reading, annotation, link following and writing practices, and their general implications for design. We then discuss how our work with a user community and an evolving e-book prototype allowed us to examine tandem issues of usability and utility, and to redesign an existing e-book user interface to suit the needs of law students. The study caused us to move away from the notion of a stand-alone reading device and toward the concept of a document laptop, a platform that would provide wireless access to information resources, as well as support a fuller spectrum of reading-related activities.},

In early 2001, at meetings in the U.S. and Europe, the version of the protocol to be used for beta testing was announced. The HTTP-based protocol uses URLs for queries and XML for responses. The default metadata record structure is unqualified Dublin Core using a specified XML Schema. This simple metadata record form is intended to support cross-domain discovery; other record structures for which XML Schemas are defined can also be made available. Developments during the beta test should include the creation of OAI-compliant repositories (data providers) and harvesters (service providers). This panel will explore the purpose and evolution of the Open Archives Initiative from the point of view of various stakeholders, with emphasis on developments during 2001.},

abstract = {Silver is an authoring tool that aims to allow novice users to edit di gital video. The goal is to make editing of digital video as easy as text editing. Silver provides multiple coordinated views, including project, source, outline, subject, storyboard, textual transcript and timeline views. Selections and edits in any view are synchronized with all other views. A variety of recognition algorithms are applied to the video and audio content and then are used to aid in the editing tasks. The Informedia Digital Library supplies the recognition algorithms and metadata used to support intelligent editing, and Informedia also provides search and a repository. The metadata includes shot boundaries and a time-synchronized transcript, which are used to support intelligent selection and intelligent cut/copy/paste.},

abstract = {This note summarizes the system development activities of the Alexandr ia Digital Earth Prototype (ADEPT) Project.5  ADEPT and the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) are, respectively, the research and operational components of the Alexandria Digital Library Project.  The goal of ADEPT is to build a distributed digital library (DL) of personalized collections of geospatially referenced information.  This DL is characterized by: (1) services for building, searching, and using personalized collections; (2) collections of georeferenced multimedia information, including dynamic simulation models of spatially distributed processes; and (3) user interfaces employing the concept of a “Digital Earth”.  Important near-term objectives for ADEPT are to build prototype collections that support  undergraduate learning in physical, human, and cultural geography and related disciplines, and then to evaluate whether using such resources helps students learn to reason scientifically.  Collections and services developed by ADEPT researchers will migrate to ADL as they mature.},

abstract = {The potential of automatically generated indexes for information acces s has been recognized for several decades (e.g., Bush 1945 [2], Edmundson and Wyllys 1961 [4]), but the quantity of text and the ambiguity of natural language processing have made progress at this task more difficult than was originally foreseen. Recently, a body of work on development of interactive systems to support phrase browsing has begun to emerge (e.g., Anick and Vaithyanathan 1997 [1], Gutwin et al. [10], Nevill-Manning et al. 1997 [17], Godby and Reighart 1998 [9]). In this paper, we consider two issues related to the use of automatically identified phrases as index terms in a dynamic text browser (DTB), a user-centered system for navigating and browsing index terms: 1) What criteria are useful for assessing the usefulness of automatically identified index terms? and 2) Is the quality of the terms identified by automatic indexing such that they provide useful access to document content? The terms that we focus on have been identified by LinkIT, a software tool for identifying significant topics in text [7]. Over 90% of the terms identified by LinkIT are coherent and therefore merit inclusion in the dynamic text browser. Terms identified by LinkIT are input to Intell-Index, a prototype DTB that supports interactive navigation of index terms. The distinction between phrasal heads (the most important words in a coherent term) and modifiers serves as the basis for a hierarchical organization of terms. This linguistically motivated structure helps users to efficiently browsing and disambiguate terms. We conclude that the approach to information access discussed in this paper is very promising, and also that there is much room for further research. In the meantime, this research is a contribution to the establishment of a solid foundation for assessing the usability of terms in phrase browsing applications.},

abstract = {Digital libraries and their user communities are increasingly internat ional in nature. However - though technological progress and global education have brought American and European communities closer - cross-cultural and other crosscutting issues impede the formation of “world community” on larger scales. The pertinent issues include: collaboration in the presence of language and cultural barriers, international copyrights, international revenue streams, and universal access. This panel will examine notions of “community” from a variety of theoretical and practical perspectives, and discuss lessons that can be gleaned from applications of the community concept. Topics are expected to include scalability, sustainability, regenerative cycles in healthy communities, and examples of digital-library efforts that have international potential or implications.},

abstract = {The Internet has considerably empowered libraries and changed common p erception of what they entail. Public libraries, in particular, are using technological advancements to expand their range of services and enhance their civic roles. Providing community information (CI) in innovative, digital forms via community networks is one way in which public libraries are facilitating everyday information needs. These networks have been lauded for their potential to strengthen physical communities through increasing information flow about local services and events, and through facilitating civic interaction. However, little is known about how the public uses such digital services and what barriers they encounter. This paper presents findings about how digital CI systems benefit physical communities based on extensive case studies in three states. At each site, rich data were collected using online surveys, field observation, in-depth interviews and focus groups with Internet users, human service providers and library staff. Both the online survey and the follow-up interviews with respondents were based on sense-making theory. In our paper we discuss our findings regarding: (1) how the public is using digital CI systems for daily problem solving, and (2) the types of barriers they encounter. Suggestions for improving digital CI systems are provided.},
