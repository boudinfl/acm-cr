abstract = {We describe here a method for automatically identifying word sense variation in a dated collection of historical books in a large digital library. By leveraging a small set of known translation book pairs to induce a bilingual sense inventory and labeled training data for a WSD classifier, we are able to automatically classify the Latin word senses in a 389 million word corpus and track the rise and fall of those senses over a span of two thousand years. We evaluate the performance of seven different classifiers both in a tenfold test on 83,892 words from the aligned parallel corpus and on a smaller, manually annotated sample of 525 words, measuring both the overall accuracy of each system and how well that accuracy correlates (via mean square error) to the observed historical variation.},

abstract = {Nowadays PDF documents have become a dominating knowledge repository for both the academia and industry largely because they are very convenient to print and exchange. However, the methods of automated structure information extraction are yet to be fully explored and the lack of effective methods hinders the information reuse of the PDF documents. To enhance the usability for PDF-formatted electronic books, we propose a novel computational framework to analyze the underlying physical structure and logical structure. The analysis is conducted at both page level and document level, including global typographies, reading order, logical elements, chapter/section hierarchy and metadata. Moreover, two characteristics of PDF-based books, i.e., style consistency in the whole book document and natural rendering order of PDF files, are fully exploited in this paper to improve the conventional image-based structure extraction methods. This paper employs the bipartite graph as a common structure for modeling various tasks, including reading order recovery, figure and caption association, and metadata extraction. Based on the graph representation, the optimal matching (OM) method is utilized to find the global optima in those tasks. Extensive benchmarking using real-world data validates the high efficiency and discrimination ability of the proposed method.},

These techniques collapse words within documents into unordered "bags of words," ignoring word order. In this paper, we present a method that examines syntactic dependency parse trees from Wikipedia article titles to learn expected patterns between relative lexical arguments. This process is highly dependent on the global word ordering of a sentence, modeling how each word interacts with other words to gain an aggregate perspective on how words interact over all 3.2 million titles. Using this information, we analyze how coherent a given topic is by comparing the relative usage vectors between the top 5 words in a topic. Results suggest that this technique can identify poor topics based on how well the relative usages align with each other within a topic, potentially aiding digital library indexing.},

abstract = {Videogames and other new media artifacts constitute an important part of our cultural and economic landscape and collecting institutions have a responsibility to collect and preserve these materials for future access. Unfortunately, these kinds of materials present unique challenges for collecting institutions including problems of collection development, technological preservation, and access. This paper presents findings from a grant-funded project focused on examining documentation of the creative process in game development. Data includes twelve qualitative interviews conducted with individuals involved in the game development process, spanning a number of different roles and institution types. The most pressing findings are related to the nature of documentation in the videogame industry: project interviews indicate that the game development process does produce significant and important documentation as traditionally conceived by collecting institutions, ranging from game design documents to email correspondence and business reports. However, while it does exist, traditional documentation does not adequately, or even, at times, truthfully represent the project or the game creation process as a whole. In order to adequately represent the development process, collecting institutions also need to seek out and procure numerous versions of games and game assets as well as those game assets that are natural byproducts of the design process like gamma and beta versions of the game, for example, vertical slices, or different renderings of graphical elements.},

abstract = {Entity resolution is the task of identifying entities that refer to the same real-world object. It has important applications in the context of digital libraries, such as citation matching and author disambiguation. Blocking is an established methodology for efficiently addressing this problem; it clusters similar entities together, and compares solely entities inside each cluster. In order to effectively deal with the current large, noisy and heterogeneous data collections, novel blocking methods that rely on redundancy have been introduced: they associate each entity with multiple blocks in order to increase recall, thus increasing the computational cost, as well.In this paper, we introduce novel techniques that remove the superfluous comparisons from any redundancy-based blocking method. They improve the time-efficiency of the latter without any impact on the end result. We present the optimal solution to this problem that discards all redundant comparisons at the cost of quadratic space complexity. For applications with space limitations, we also present an alternative, lightweight solution that operates at the abstract level of blocks in order to discard a significant part of the redundant comparisons. We evaluate our techniques on two large, real-world data sets and verify the significant improvements they convey when integrated into existing blocking methods.},

abstract = {Individuals contribute content on the Web at an unprecedented rate, accumulating immense quantities of (semi-)structured data. Wisdom of the Crowds theory advocates that such information (or parts of it) is constantly overwritten, updated, or even deleted by other users, with the goal of rendering it more accurate, or up-to-date. This is particularly true for the collaboratively edited, semi-structured data of entity repositories, whose entity profiles are consistently kept fresh. Therefore, their core information that remain stable with the passage of time, despite being reviewed by numerous users, are particularly useful for the description of an entity.Based on the above hypothesis, we introduce a classification scheme that predicts, on the basis of statistical and content patterns, whether an attribute (i.e., name-value pair) is going to be modified in the future. We apply our scheme on a large, real-world, versioned dataset and verify its effectiveness. Our thorough experimental study also suggests that reducing entity profiles to their stable parts conveys significant benefits to two common tasks in computer science: information retrieval and information integration.},

In this work, we investigate whether this assumption is true. We focus on the use of tags in domain-specific websites because such websites are more likely to have a coherent, discernible website structure and because the users that are searching for and tagging pages in such a site may have specific information needs (as opposed to the broad range of information needs that users have when browsing/searching the Internet at large). For this study, we assume that the application of the same tag to multiple pages provides an indication that those pages are related. To determine whether this indication of relatedness is contributing new information, we first measure whether pages with common tag(s) could have been deemed as related based on site structure as measured by shortest navigational distance between pages. Second, we measure whether or not tags could have been determined algorithmically based on standard tf-idf scores of terms on the page. Based on our analysis of two different sites, we found that tags contribute novel information that is not discernible from site structure or site/page content.},

abstract = {A pattern is a model or a template used to summarize and describe the behavior (or the trend) of a data having generally some recurrent events. Patterns have received a considerable attention in recent years and were widely studied in the data mining field. Various pattern mining approaches have been proposed and used for different applications such as network monitoring, moving object tracking, financial or medical data analysis, scientific data processing, etc. In these different contexts, discovered patterns were useful to detect anomalies, to predict data behavior (or trend), or more generally, to simplify data processing or to improve system performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, patterns have never been used in the context of web archiving. Web archiving is the process of continuously collecting and preserving portions of the World Wide Web for future generations. In this paper, we show how patterns of page changes can be useful tools to efficiently archive web sites. We first define our pattern model that describes the changes of pages. Then, we present the strategy used to (i) extract the temporal evolution of page changes, to (ii) discover patterns and to (iii) exploit them to improve web archives. We choose the archive of French public TV channels « France T\'{e}l\'{e}visions » as a case study in order to validate our approach. Our experimental evaluation based on real web pages shows the utility of patterns to improve archive quality and to optimize indexing or storing.},

abstract = {Academic homepages are rich sources of information on scientific research and researchers. Most researchers provide information about themselves and links to their research publications on their homepages. In this study, we address the following questions related to academic homepages: (1) How many academic homepages are there on the web? (2) Can we accurately discriminate between academic homepages and other webpages? and (3) What information can be extracted about researchers from their homepages? For addressing the first question, we use mark-recapture techniques commonly employed in biometrics to estimate animal population sizes. Our results indicate that academic homepages comprise a small fraction of the Web making automatic methods for discriminating them crucial. We study the performance of content-based features for classifying webpages. We propose the use of topic models for identifying content-based features for classification and show that a small set of LDA-based features out-perform term features selected using traditional techniques such as aggregate term frequencies or mutual information. Finally, we deal with the extraction of name and research interests information from an academic homepage. Term-topic associations obtained from topic models are used to design a novel, unsupervised technique to identify short segments corresponding to research interests of the researchers specified in academic homepages. We show the efficacy of our proposed methods on all the three tasks by experimentally evaluating them on multiple publicly-available datasets.},

After experiencing this web time travel, the in- evitable question that comes to mind is "How much of the Web is archived?" This question is studied by approximating the Web via sampling URIs from DMOZ, Delicious, Bitly, and search engine indexes and measuring number of archive copies available in various public web archives. The results indicate that 35%-90% of URIs have at least one archived copy, 17%-49% have two to five copies, 1%-8% have six to ten copies, and 8%-63% at least ten copies. The number of URI copies varies as a function of time, but only 14.6-31.3% of URIs are archived more than once per month.},

abstract = {For discovering the new URI of a missing web page, lexical signatures, which consist of a small number of words chosen to represent the "aboutness" of a page, have been previously proposed. However, prior methods relied on computing the lexical signature before the page was lost, or using cached or archived versions of the page to calculate a lexical signature. We demonstrate a system of constructing a lexical signature for a page from its link neighborhood, that is the "backlinks", or pages that link to the missing page. After testing various methods, we show that one can construct a lexical signature for a missing web page using only ten backlink pages. Further, we show that only the first level of backlinks are useful in this effort. The text that the backlinks use to point to the missing page is used as input for the creation of a four-word lexical signature. That lexical signature is shown to successfully find the target URI in more than half of the test cases.},

However, little empirical research has been conducted to explore the motivations underlying users' news sharing behavior. Adopting the uses and gratifications perspective, this study examined the role of gratification factors and user experience in explaining users' news sharing intention on social media. Hierarchical regression was employed to analyze the data collected from 144 undergraduate and graduate students. The results show that status seeking was the strongest motivation in predicting news sharing intention, followed by sociality and informativeness. However, entertainment/escapism was not a significant predictor in contrast to prior work. Further, we examined user experience in predicting news sharing intention and identified it as a significant factor.},

abstract = {In CADAL, there preserve a lot of Chinese classical literatures, including graceful prose and verse. These works written in ancient Chinese comparatively are concise in vocabulary and sentence patterns. But they express rich feelings and convey a wealth of information. Although can be explained in modern Chinese, the aesthetic sense in those works disappears. So we aim to illustrate the feeling in these works using Chinese traditional music which is also another part of Chinese culture. This is an interesting and challenging work. In this paper, the correlation between the text and music is studied. A novel approach is proposed to model the latent semantic association underlying the two medium. Based on the correlation model we learned from training data, we can associate a literary work (mainly verse and prose in our digital library) with a few music pieces automatically. When a reader is appreciating a literary work, a piece of background music is playing meanwhile, the information and emotion implied by the work and music blend together. The reader may be immersed into the emotion and obtain aesthetic enjoyment intensively. We implement the proposed method and design experiments to evaluate the performance of it. The experimental result substantiates the feasibility of the proposed approach in this paper.},

A survey was administered to 250 social media-savvy respondents to investigate their attitudes about saving, sharing, publishing, and removing online photos; the survey also explored participants' current photo-sharing and reuse practices, and their general expectations of photo reuse. Our probe of respondent attitudes revealed that respondents felt: (1) people should be able to save visual media, regardless of its source; (2) people have slightly less right to reuse photos than they do to save them; (3) a photo's subject has a slightly greater right than the photographer to reuse the photo in non-commercial situations; (4) removal is controversial, but trends more positive when it involves only metadata (e.g. tags); and (5) access to institutional archives of personal photos is better deferred for 50 years. Participants explained their own reuse of online photos in pragmatic terms that included the nature of the content, the aim and circumstances of reuse, their sense of the photo's original use, and their understanding of existing laws and restrictions. In the abstract, the same general question revealed a 'reuse paradox'; while respondents trust themselves to make this judgment, they do not trust the reciprocal judgment of unknown others.},

abstract = {In the process of digitizing a book, a library needs to clear the rights associated with it. Rights clearance is a time consuming process, and possibly, with higher costs than the actual digitization. To analyze the rights situation, a range of information is required, which is distributed across several national databases hosted in national libraries, publishers and collective rights organizations. National bibliographies are key data sources in these processes, as they are the only source to identify all the publications of a specific intellectual work per country. However, national bibliographies are not built for rights clearance purposes. The information in bibliographic records results from cataloguing practices with users and library management in mind, and links between different publications of a single intellectual work are not available. This paper presents a study on the implications of data quality problems of national bibliographies for the identification of all publications of a work. It also presents an approach for work data extraction and matching based on similarity of the most discriminatory attributes of works. Evaluation has shown that the data quality problems are difficult to overcome, as our best approach achieved an F0,5-measure of 0,91. These results help to speed up the process of discovering all relevant publications per work significantly, with sufficient recall.},

The model is designed from a set of requirements derived from the real world use cases of some of the largest digitized medieval content holders, and instantiations of the model are intended as the input to collection-independent page turning and scholarly presentation interfaces. A canvas painting paradigm, such as in PDF and SVG, was selected based on the lack of a one to one correlation between image and page, and to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text of a page is known, but only fragments of the physical object remain. The model is implemented using technologies such as OAI-ORE Aggregations and OAC Annotations, as the fundamental building blocks of emerging Linked Digital Libraries. The model and implementation are evaluated through prototypes of both content providing and consuming applications. Although the system was designed from requirements drawn from the medieval manuscript domain, it is applicable to any layout-oriented presentation of images of text.},

abstract = {Many scholarly tasks involve working with subdocuments, or contextualized fine-grain information, i.e., with information that is part of some larger unit. A digital library (DL) facilitates management, access, retrieval, and use of collections of data and metadata through services. However, most DLs do not provide infrastructure or services to support working with subdocuments. Superimposed information (SI) refers to new information that is created to reference subdocuments in existing information resources. We combine this idea of SI with traditional DL services, to define and develop a DL with SI (SI-DL). We explored the use of subimages and evaluated the use of SuperIDR, a prototype SI-DL, in fish species identification, a scholarly task that involves working with subimages. The contexts and strategies of working with subimages in SuperIDR suggest new and enhanced support (SI-DL services) for scholarly tasks that involve working with subimages, including new ways of querying and searching for subimages and associated information. The main conceptual contributions of our work are the insights gained from these findings of the use of subimages and of SuperIDR, which lead to recommendations for the design of digital libraries with superimposed information.},

abstract = {We need to harness the growing wealth of information in digital libraries to support intellectual work involving creative and exploratory processes. Prior research on hypertext authoring shifted the focus from explicit structure to direct presentation of content aided by "implicit" spatial representation of structure. We likewise shift the field of information visualization. Using hypertext's rubric, we redefine what most people think of as "information visualization" as explicit structure visualization. We alternatively address implicit structure visualization, presenting content directly, representing structure with spatiality and other visual features. We integrate authoring to emphasize the role of human thought in learning and ideation. Prior research has shown that people iteratively collect and organize information by clipping magazines, piling clippings in somewhat messy ways, and organizing them. MessyOrganizer is an iterative implicit structure visualization algorithm which, like human practice, gradually collects and organizes information clippings. Content is depicted directly. Structural relationships are visualized implicitly through spatial positioning of related elements, with overlap and translucence. The simulated annealing algorithm is applied to a model of semantic relatedness over a spatial grid. We develop an experiment comparing products created with the integrated environment versus separated visualization and authoring spaces. Results reveal that participants have more novel and varied ideas when visualization is integrated with authoring.},

OntoStarFish makes such relationships explicit so users may visualize them and detect potential collaboration networks. Users that may be interested in exploring collaboration networks include researchers looking for partners for specific projects as well as funding agencies concerned with the strength of associations among participants of competing proposals. OntoStarFish is based upon the use of multiple fisheye views that can be placed on top of starfields, dynamic scatter plots for which each axis is determined by a lightweight ontology of attributes associated to potential collaborators.},

abstract = {Collaborative research has been increasingly popular and important in academic circles. However, there is no open platform available for scholars or scientists to effectively discover potential collaborators. This paper discusses CollabSeer, an open system to recommend potential research collaborators for scholars and scientists. CollabSeer discovers collaborators based on the structure of the coauthor network and a user's research interests. Currently, three different network structure analysis methods that use vertex similarity are supported in CollabSeer: Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity, and our relation strength similarity measure. Users can also request a recommendation by selecting a topic of interest. The topic of interest list is determined by CollabSeer's lexical analysis module, which analyzes the key phrases of previous publications. The CollabSeer system is highly modularized making it easy to add or replace the network analysis module or users' topic of interest analysis module. CollabSeer integrates the results of the two modules to recommend collaborators to users. Initial experimental results over a subset of the CiteSeerX database show that CollabSeer can efficiently discover prospective collaborators.},

We evaluate the performance of the algorithm to improve the resolution of mesoscopic network structures, that is those meso-level structures of a network resulting from groupings of nodes and their interlinking. To this end, we establish the ground truth for a sample of author names that is statistically representative of different types of nodes in the co-author network, distinguished by their role for the connectivity of the network. We finally observe that this distinction of node roles based on the mesoscopic structure of the network, in combination with a quantification of the commonality of last names, suggests a new approach to assess network distortion by homonymy and to analyze the reduction of distortion in the network after disambiguation, without requiring ground truth sampling.},

We propose graph-based models that accommodate multiple sources of evidence in a PageRank-like algorithm for ranking experts.

This new approach is able to identify similar and plagiarized documents based on the citations used in the text. It is shown that citation-based plagiarism detection performs significantly better than text-based procedures in identifying strong paraphrasing, translation and some idea plagiarism. Detection rates can be improved by combining citation-based with text-based plagiarism detection.},

abstract = {With the growth in operational digital libraries, the need for automatic methods capable of characterizing adoption and use has grown. We describe a computational methodology for producing two, inter-related, user typologies based on use diffusion. Use diffusion theory views technology adoption as a process that can lead to widely different patterns of use across a given population of potential users; these models use measures of frequency and variety to characterize and describe these usage patterns. The methodology uses computational techniques such as clickstream entropy and clustering to produce both coarse-grained and fine-grained user typologies. A case study demonstrates the utility and applicability of the method: it is used to understand how middle and high school science teachers participating in an academic year-long field trial adopted and integrated digital library resources into their instructional planning and teaching. The resulting fine-grained user typology identified five different types of teacher-users, including "interactive resource specialists" and "community seeker specialists" This typology was validated through comparison with qualitative and quantitative data collected using traditional educational field research methods.},

abstract = {Although initiatives are underway in the educational community to consolidate disparate collections of educational standards, little has been done to explore the impact of educational standard formulation on information retrieval. Recent research contrasts two categories of educational standards: 'World' (topical domain-related concepts) and 'Method' (investigative and epistemological principles). This paper explores the information retrieval implications of the World vs. Method distinction. We find that experts are more likely to agree about which educational resources align with a Method standard but that a typical automatic standard assignment tool is more likely to assign a World standard to an educational resource. Further, a text-based information retrieval system is more likely to be accurate in retrieving documents relevant to a World standard as compared to a Method standard. These findings have implications both for educational standard formulation (combining World and Method components in a standard may improve retrieval) and for digital library builders who want to help teachers identify useful, standards-aligned learning objects.},

abstract = {A book recommender system is very useful for a digital library. Good book recommender systems can effectively help users find interesting and relevant books from the massive resources, by providing individual recommendation book list for each end-user. By now, a variety of collaborative filtering algorithms have been invented, which are the cores of most recommender systems. However, because of the explosion of information, especially in the Internet, the improvement of the efficiency of the collaborative filting (CF) algorithm becomes more and more important. In this paper, we first propose a parallel Top-N recommendation algorithm in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) which combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach to deal with the cold-start user problem. Then based on this algorithm, we present a parallel book recommender system on a GPU (Graphics Processor unit) for CADAL digital library platform. Our experimental results show our algorithm is very efficient to process the large-scale datasets with good accuracy, and we report the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation performance.},

abstract = {As the number of research papers available on the Web has increased enormously over the years, paper recommender systems have been proposed to help researchers on automatically finding works of interest. The main problem with the current approaches is that they assume that recommending algorithms are provided with a rich set of evidence (e.g., document collections, citations, profiles) which is normally not widely available. In this paper we propose a novel source independent framework for research paper recommendation. The framework requires as input only a single research paper and generates several potential queries by using terms in that paper, which are then submitted to existing Web information sources that hold research papers. Once a set of candidate papers for recommendation is generated, the framework applies content-based recommending algorithms to rank the candidates in order to recommend the ones most related to the input paper. This is done by using only publicly available metadata (i.e., title and abstract). We evaluate our proposed framework by performing an extensive experimentation in which we analyzed several strategies for query generation and several ranking strategies for paper recommendation. Our results show that good recommendations can be obtained with simple and low cost strategies.},

abstract = {This paper explores the cognitive processes and online behaviors in which preservice teachers engage when seeking educational resources for classroom instruction. Participants used graphical and keyword search interfaces provided by a large-scale digital library (NSDL.org) and a keyword search interface from a large, commercial search engine (Google.com) to complete searches for online materials that would support classroom instruction. Overall, findings from the current work indicate that a graphical search interface can support comprehension by providing a conceptual organization of domain content during digital search and evaluation. Findings also show that digital libraries allow users to offload processing related to resource trustworthiness, thereby increasing cognitive capacity for other purposes.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the information access is conducted almost exclusively using the Web. Simple keyword based Web search engines, e.g. Google or Yahoo!, offer suitable retrieval and ranking features. In contrast, for highly specialized domains, represented by digital libraries, these features are insufficient. Considering the domain of chemistry, where searching for relevant literature is essentially centered on chemical entities. Beside commercial information providers such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numerous groups are working on building free chemical search engines to overcome the expensive access to chemical literature. However, due to the nature of chemical queries these are often overspecialized. Often we need meaningful similarity measures for chemical entities for query relaxation. In chemistry, the similarity measures are vast; more than 40 similarity measures are available and focus on different aspects of chemical entities. This vast number of similarity measures is obvious, because the desired search results highly depend on the working field of the chemist. In this paper we present a personalized retrieval system for chemical documents taking into account the background knowledge of the individual chemist. This is done by a query relaxation for chemical entities using similar substances. We evaluate our approach extensively by analyzing the correlation of commonly used chemical similarity measures and fingerprint representations. All uncorrelated measures are finally used by our feedback engine to learn preferred similarity measures for each user. We also conducted a user study with domain experts showing that our system can assign a unique similarity measure for 75% of the users after only 10 feedback cycles.},

The answers were collected over a broad time span, but are presented to the user as if he or she is conducting the personal interview, similar to naturally conversing with the expert. This "synthetic interview" style is discussed in this paper, with a mixed methods evaluation by 19 high school teachers who used Physics Pathway for a 14-week period at the end of 2010. The evaluation with teachers showed that the synthetic interviews validated or reinforced their ideas on their course materials and delivery. As these are teachers who are relatively new to physics instruction, confirmation that they are teaching well is important.

abstract = {This paper describes an approach for performing recognition and resolution of place names mentioned over the descriptive metadata records of typical digital libraries. Our approach exploits evidence provided by the existing structured attributes within the metadata records to support the place name recognition and resolution, in order to achieve better results than by just using lexical evidence from the textual values of these attributes. In metadata records, lexical evidence is very often insufficient for this task, since short sentences and simple expressions are predominant. Our implementation uses a dictionary based technique for recognition of place names (with names provided by Geonames), and machine learning for reasoning on the evidences and choosing a possible resolution candidate. The evaluation of our approach was performed in data sets with a metadata schema rich in Dublin Core elements. Two evaluation methods were used. First, we used cross-validation, which showed that our solution is able to achieve a very high precision of 0,99 at 0,55 recall, or a recall of 0,79 at 0,86 precision. Second, we used a comparative evaluation with an existing commercial service, where our solution performed better on any confidence level (p&lt;0,001).},

Text in videos is a very meaningful clue for video semantic understanding, and it can be used for video organization and retrieval. However, existing text recognizing methods can not deal with multilingual texts or texts embedded in a complex background very well. In this paper, we propose a novel video text detection method. Edge detection and candidate region extraction are firstly used to obtain all rough candidate text regions, and then region refinement is used to obtain the accurate location of each region. Based on our observation that a real text region has a uniform distribution with its non-zero pixels in its binary image, an entropy filter is used to remove non-text regions. Experiments on various videos show that our method is effective and robust against different languages, background complexities and font styles.},

The degree to which this data can be accessed, retrieved, and analyzed is decisive to obtain progress in fields such as scientific research or industrial production. We present a novel method supporting content-based retrieval and exploratory search in repositories of multivariate research data. In particular, functional dependencies are a key characteristic of data that researchers are often interested in. Our methods are able to describe the functional form of such dependencies, e.g., the relationship between inflation and unemployment in economics. Our basic idea is to use feature vectors based on the goodness-of-fit of a set of regression models, to describe the data mathematically. We denote this approach Regressional Features and use it for content-based search and, since our approach motivates an intuitive definition of interestingness, for exploring the most interesting data. We apply our method on considerable real-world research datasets, showing the usefulness of our approach for user-centered access to research data in a Digital Library system.},

The goal of search result diversification is to return search results that not only are relevant to the query but also cover different subtopics. Therefore, the subtopic modeling is an important research topic in search result diversification. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern based method to extract subtopics from retrieved documents. The basic idea is to explicitly model a query subtopic as a semantically meaningful text unit in relevant documents. We apply a frequent pattern mining algorithm to efficiently extract these text units (patterns) from retrieved documents. We then model a query subtopic with a single pattern and rank subtopics based on their similarity with the query. These pattern based subtopics are then used to diversify search results.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new idea and approach for the web video search. Instead of only using the surrounding text of video in webpage, our approach boosts mutually and utilizes jointly the inside and outside text of video to support the video-based and frame-based search. In our approach, the inside text is the video caption, while the outside text is the surrounding text of video in webpage. In our view, the caption text, although has some wrong characters and words caused by the automatic caption recognition, is a useful indicator for the content of video. While the relevant surrounding texts of video, although is difficult to locate and confirm, have the correct characters and words which usually indicate the video content, especially the title and introduction of video. In this paper, we integrate their advantages and alleviate their disadvantages by the mutual boosting idea, that is, to employ the inside text to confirm the relevance of outside text, and to utilize the relevant outside text to correct the inside text. Mutual boosting not only enhances the query-by-text video search, but also further supports the query-by-text frame search with the corrected caption. Based on the above idea, our approach can be divided into three phases: Firstly, we proposed a new approach for automatic caption detection and extraction. Then, we extract the surrounding text candidates of video. Finally, the mutual boosting approach is employed to get the relevant and accurate text of web video. The experiments show the proposed approach can achieve good performance.},

Exploration demands more time, effort and creativity from the user, but rewards the user with deeper knowledge.

Our experiments indicate: first, social reference implies connections among literatures which are as effective as citation in clustering academic resources; second, in practical settings, social reference-based clustering methods are not as effective as citation-based ones due to the sparseness of social reference data, but they can outperform in clustering new resources that have few citation.},

abstract = {The National Chung Hsing University Library has built a digital archive about Taiwan agricultural history. The content is unique in that it covers historical materials about Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period from 1895 to 1945, and that they are all available in full text, in addition to metadata. To make these materials more accessible to the research and education community, a user-centered retrieval system incorporated with multi-language, subject browsing, cluster analysis, topic map, post-query classification methods was developed to help users find the inter-relationships among documents and the collective meaning of a sub-collection. Such system is anticipated to help advance research in Taiwan agricultural history and set a model for other similar endeavor.},

While the need for guidelines or a framework in developing such data policies is imminent, research is lacking in this area. The study reported here addresses this need by using a content analysis of 58 policy documents from 20 institutions. Our preliminary findings reveal an uneven distribution of data policies among the institutions and disciplines included in this study. We are currently analyzing our results.},

Still, the server side database is indispensable as the central hub for exchanging persistent data between the web clients. Assuming this characterization, we propose a novel web application framework in which the server archives its database states at predefined periods then makes them available on the web. The clients then use these archives to synchronize their local databases. Although the main purpose is to reduce the database scalability bottleneck, this approach also promotes self-archiving and can be used for time traveling. We discuss the consistency properties provided by this framework, as well as the tradeoffs imposed.},

In order to accomplish these goals, we have created a web service that handles the storage and representation of our Path data structure. This service is isolated from user interface layers, allowing multiple interface designs to be implemented on top of the same Path data structures. Our prototype interfaces also represent new areas for Paths such as collaborative work, offline presentation, and mobile computing.},

abstract = {The Bushman texts in the Bleek and Lloyd Collection contain complex diacritics that make automatic transcription difficult. Transcriptions of these texts would allow for enhanced digital library services to be created for interacting with the collection. In this study, an investigation into automatic transcription of the Bushman texts was performed using the popular method of using a Hidden Markov Model for text line recognition. The results show that while this technique may be well suited to well-constrained and understood scripts, its application to more complex scripts introduces a number of difficulties that need to be overcome.},

abstract = {Experimental evaluation and comparison of techniques, algorithms or complete systems is a crucial requirement to assess the practical impact of research results. The quality of published experimental results is usually limited due to several reasons such as: limited time, unavailability of standard benchmarks or shortage of computing resources. Moreover, achieving an independent, consistent, complete and insightful assessment for different alternatives in the same domain is a time and resource consuming task. We demonstrate Liquid Benchmark as a cloud-based service that provides collaborative platforms to simplify the task of peer researchers in performing high quality experimental evaluations and guarantee a transparent scientific crediting process. The service allows building repositories of competing research implementations, sharing testing computing platforms, collaboratively building the specifications of standard benchmarks and allowing end-users to easily create and run testing experiments and share their results.},

The idea draws upon mobile libraries (bookmobiles) for its inspiration, which first appeared in Victorian times. The implemented technique works by building on the mesh network that is instrumental to the XO-laptop approach. To use the technique, on each portable XO-laptop a version of Greenstone is installed, allowing the owner to develop and manage their own set of books. The version of Greenstone has been adapted to support a form of interoperability we have called Digital Library Talkback. On the mesh, when two XO-laptops "see" each other, the two users can search and browse the other user's digital library; when they see a book they like, they can have it transferred to their library with a single click using the Digital Library Talkback mechanism.},
