abstract = {At present, music digital library systems are being developed based on anecdotal evidence of user needs, intuitive feelings for user information seeking behavior, and a priori assumptions of typical usage scenarios. Emphasis has been placed on basic research into music document representation, efficient searching, and audio-based searching, rather than on exploring the music information needs or information behavior of a target user group. This paper focuses on eliciting the native music information strategies employed by people searching for popular music (that is, music sought for recreational or enjoyment purposes rather than to support a serious or scientific exploration of some aspect of music). To this end, we conducted an ethnographic study of the searching/browsing techniques employed by people in the researchers local communities, as they use two common sources of music: the public library and music stores. We argue that the insights provided by this type of study can inform the development of searching/browsing support for music digital libraries.},

publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This paper describes a method of automatically creating a content-based index of musical scores. The goal is to capture the themes, or motifs, that appear in the music. The method was tested by building an index of 25 orchestral movements from the classical music literature. For every movement, the system captured the primary theme, or a variation of the primary theme. In addition, it captured 13 of 28 secondary themes. The resulting index was 14% of the size of the database. A further reduction of 2% is possible; however, this discards secondary themes. A listening experiment using five orchestral movements showed that people can reliably recognize secondary themes after listening to a piece of music-therefore, it may be necessary to retain secondary themes in a score index.},

abstract = {A musical piece typically has a repetitive structure. Analysis of this structure will be useful for music segmentation, indexing and thumbnailing. This paper presents an algorithm that can automatically analyze the repetitive structure of musical signals. First, the algorithm detects the repetitions of each segment of fixed length in a piece using dynamic programming. Second, the algorithm summarizes this repetition information and infers the structure based on heuristic rules. The performance of the approach is demonstrated visually using figures for qualitative evaluation, and by two structural similarity measures for quantitative evaluation. Based on the structural analysis result, this paper also proposes a method for music thumbnailing. The preliminary results obtained using a corpus of Beatles' songs show that automatic structural analysis and thumbnailing of music are possible.},

abstract = {Automatic metadata generation provides scalability and usability for digital libraries and their collections. Machine learning methods offer robust and adaptable automatic metadata extraction. We describe a Support Vector Machine classification-based method for metadata extraction from header part of research papers and show that it outperforms other machine learning methods on the same task. The method first classifies each line of the header into one or more of 15 classes. An iterative convergence procedure is then used to improve the line classification by using the predicted class labels of its neighbor lines in the previous round. Further metadata extraction is done by seeking the best chunk boundaries of each line. We found that discovery and use of the structural patterns of the data and domain based word clustering can improve the metadata extraction performance. An appropriate feature normalization also greatly improves the classification performance. Our metadata extraction method was originally designed to improve the metadata extraction quality of the digital libraries Citeseer [17] and EbizSearch[24]. We believe it can be generalized to other digital libraries.},

publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method for extracting bibliographic attributes from reference strings captured using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and an extended hidden Markov model. Bibliographic attribute extraction can be used in two ways. One is reference parsing in which attribute values are extracted from OCR-processed references for bibliographic matching. The other is reference alignment in which attribute values are aligned to the bibliographic record to enrich the vocabulary of the bibliographic database. In this paper, we first propose a statistical model for attribute extraction that represents both the syntactical structure of references and OCR error patterns. Then, we perform experiments using bibliographic references obtained from scanned images of papers in journals and transactions and show that useful attribute values are extracted from OCR-processed references. We also show that the proposed model has advantages in reducing the cost of preparing training data, a critical problem in rule-based systems.},

abstract = {Effective information retrieval (IR) using domain knowledge and semantics is one of the major challenges in IR. In this paper we propose a framework that can facilitate image retrieval based on a sharable domain ontology and thesaurus. In particular, case-based learning (CBL) using a natural language phrase parser is proposed to convert a natural language query into resource description framework (RDF) format, a semantic-web standard of metadata description that supports machine readable semantic representation. This same parser also is extended to perform semantic annotation on the descriptive metadata of images and convert metadata automatically into the same RDF representation. The retrieval of images then can be conducted by matching the semantic and structural descriptions of the user query with those of the annotated descriptive metadata of images. We tested in our problem domain by retrieving the historical and cultural images taken from Dr. Ching-chih Chen's "First Emperor of China" CD-ROM [25] as part of our productive international digital library collaboration. We have constructed and implemented the domain ontology, a Mandarin Chinese thesaurus, as well as the similarity match and retrieval algorithms in order to test our proposed framework. Our experiments have shown the feasibility and usability of these approaches.},

isbn = {0769519393},

address = {USA},
abstract = {The Metis project is developing workflow technology designed for use in digital libraries by avoiding the assumptions made by traditional workflow systems. In particular, digital libraries have highly distributed sets of stake-holders who nevertheless must work together to perform shared activities. Hence, traditional assumptions that all members of a workflow belong to the same organization, work in the same fashion, or have access to similar computing platforms are invalid. The Metis approach makes use of event-based workflows to support the distributed nature of digital library workflow and employs techniques to make the resulting technology lightweight, flexible, and integrated with the Web. This paper describes the conceptual framework behind the Metis approach as well as a prototype which implements the framework. The prototype represents a "proof-of-concept" of the Metis framework and approach as we show how it can both model and execute a peer review workflow drawn from a "real-world" digital library. After describing related work, the paper concludes with a discussion of future research opportunities in the area of digital library workflow and outlines how Metis is being deployed to a small set of digital libraries for additional evaluation.},

We start with an authoritative list of art objects, and seek to match variants of these named entities in related text. Our approach is to "decay" entities into progressively more general variants while retaining high precision. As variants become more general, and thus more ambiguous, we propose methods to disambiguate intermediate results.

abstract = {The increasing power of techniques to model complex geometry and extract meaning from 3D information create complex data that must be described, stored, and displayed to be useful to researchers. Responding to the limitations of two-dimensional (2D) data representations perceived by discipline scientists, the Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling (PRISM) project at Arizona State University (ASU) developed modeling and analytic tools that raise the level of abstraction and add semantic value to 3D data. The goals are to improve scientific communication, and to assist in generating new knowledge, particularly for natural objects whose asymmetry limit study using 2D representations. The tools simplify analysis of surface and volume using curvature and topology to help researchers understand and interact with 3D data. The tools produced automatically extract information about features and regions of interest to researchers, calculate quantifiable, replicable metric data, and generate metadata about the object being studied. To help researchers interact with the information, the project developed prototype interactive, sketch-based interfaces that permit researchers to remotely search, identify and interact with the detailed, highly accurate 3D models of the objects. The results support comparative analysis of contextual and spatial information, and extend research about asymmetric manmade and natural objects.},

abstract = {Can digital libraries provide a reading experience that more closely resembles a real book than a scrolled or paginated electronic display? This paper describes a prototype page-turning system that realistically animates full three-dimensional page-turns. The dynamic behavior is generated by a mass-spring model defined on a rectangular grid of particles. The prototype takes a PDF or E-book file, renders it into a sequence of PNG images representing individual pages, and animates the pageturns under user control. The simulation behaves fairly naturally, although more computer graphics work is required to perfect it.},

abstract = {The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) began as an alternative to distributed searching of scholarly eprint repositories. The model embraced by the OAI-PMH is that of metadata harvesting, where value-added services (by a "service provider") are constructed on cached copies of the metadata extracted from the repositories of the harvester's choosing. While this model dispenses with the well known problems of distributed searching, it introduces the problem of synchronization. Stated simply, this problem arises when the service provider's copy of the metadata does not match the metadata currently at the constituent repositories. We define some metrics for describing the synchronization problem in the OAI-PMH. Based on these metrics, we study the synchronization problem of the OAI-PMH framework and propose several approaches for harvesters to implement better synchronization. In particular, if a repository knows its update frequency, it can publish it in an OAI-PMH Identify response using an optional About container that borrows from RDF Site Syndication (RSS) Format.},

We provide an in depth description of an approach in which a data provider makes a metadata collection available as an XML file with a specific format -- an OAI Static Repository - which is made OAI-PMH harvestable through the intermediation of software - an OAI Static Repository Gateway - operated by a third party. We describe the properties of both components, and provide insights in our experience with an experimental implementation of a Gateway.},

abstract = {To support effective browsing, interfaces to digital video libraries should include video surrogates (i.e., smaller objects that can stand in for the videos in the collection, analogous to abstracts standing in for documents). The current study investigated four variations (i.e., speeds) of one form of video surrogate: a fast forward created by selecting every Nth frame from the full video. In addition, it tested the validity of six measures of user performance when interacting with video surrogates. Forty-five study participants interacted with all four versions of the fast forward surrogate, and completed all six performance tasks with each. Surrogate speed affected performance on four of the measures: object recognition (graphical), action recognition, linguistic gist comprehension (full text), and visual gist comprehension. Based on these results, we recommend a fast forward default speed of 1:64 of the original video keyframes. In addition, users should control the choice of fast forward speed to adjust for content characteristics and personal preferences.},

In GPortal, all metadata resources are represented in XML (Extensible Markup Language) and they are compliant to some resource schemas defined by their creators. The resource schemas are extended versions of a basic resource schema making it easy to accommodate all kinds of metadata resources while maintaining the portability of resource data. To support queries over the geospatial and georeferenced metadata resources, a XQuery-like query language known as RQL (Resource Query Language) has been designed. In this paper, we present the RQL language features and provide some experimental findings about the storage design and query evaluation strategies for RQL queries.},

Participants' expect that the added value of educational digital collections is the provision of: (1) 'high quality' teaching and learning resources, and (2) additional contextual information beyond that in the resource. Key factors that influence educators' perceptions of quality were identified: scientific accuracy, bias, advertising, design and usability, and the potential for student distraction. The data showed that participants judged these criteria along a continuum of tolerance, combining consideration of several factors in their final judgements.

Individual information presentation components, like the video player and text chat room, are "smartly" linked together through video timestamps and hyperlinks. A field study related to children book selections using ISEE was conducted. The results indicated that the combination of three information presentation components, including video player with storyboard, shared browser, and text chat room, provided an effective and more comfortable collaboration and learning environment for the given tasks than text reviews or text chat alone or in combination. The video player was the most preferred information component. Text comments in the chat room that did not synchronize with the video content distracted some participants due to limited cognitive capacity. Using smartlink to synchronize various information components or "channels" is our attempt to reduce the user's working memory load in information enriched distance learning environments made possible by digital libraries.},

abstract = {This research describes an empirical study of how the unqualified Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DC or DCMES) is used by 100 Data Providers (DPs) registered with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). The research was conducted to determine whether or not the DCMES is used to its full capabilities. Eighty-two of 100 DPs have metadata records available for analysis. DCMES usage varies by type of DP. The average number of Dublin Core elements per record is eight, with an average of 91, 785 Dublin Core elements in each DP. Five of the 15 elements of the DCMES are used 71% of the time. The results show the unqualified DCMES is not used to its fullest extent within DPs registered with the OAI.},

abstract = {People who create digital libraries need to gather together the raw material, add metadata as necessary, and design and build new collections. This paper sets out the requirements for these tasks and describes a new tool that supports them interactively, making it easy for users to create their own collections from electronic files of all types. The process involves selecting documents for inclusion, coming up with a suitable metadata set, assigning metadata to each document or group of documents, designing the form of the collection in terms of document formats, searchable indexes, and browsing facilities, building the necessary indexes and data structures, and putting the collection in place for others to use. Moreover, different situations require different workflows, and the system must be flexible enough to cope with these demands. Although the tool is specific to the Greenstone digital library software, the underlying ideas should prove useful in more general contexts.},

The Web-DL environment will allow us to collect data from the Web, standardize it, and publish it through a digital library system. It provides support to services and organizational structure normally available in digital libraries, but benefiting from the breadth of the Web contents. We experimented with applying the Web-DL environment to the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), thus demonstrating that the rapid construction of DLs from the Web is possible. Also, Web-DL provides an alternative as a largescale solution for interoperability between independent digital libraries.},

We find that the degree of maintainer activity for a given site (as measured by the voluntary development ofdescriptive metadata) is a stronger link count predictor for ibiblio than is a site's age, as the standard model predicts. Thus we argue that the efforts of ibiblio's contributors positively affectthe popularity of their materials.},

year = {2003},
isbn = {0769519393},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Medical media resources exist in a variety of analog and digital formats. Collections are generally organized and stored by their owners, each of whom utilizes their own method of cataloging and retrieval. As faculty retire, move on, or pass away, institutions risk losing the expertise that enhances the value media. The Stanford MediaServer has previously been deployed to catalog, organize, and centralize management of such media collections via the World Wide Web. Educational tools have been developed on top of existing MediaServer infrastructure to address a range of pedagogical models, and to promote widespread adoption within the Stanford Medical School curriculum and departments. These tools include Slide Show, Export to PowerPoint, Teaching File, and e-Books. With the exception of e-Books, these tools use web-based wizards to lead the user through the steps for creating each component.Slide Shows consist of an ordered set of images and provide the underpinning data structures for PowerPoint and Teaching File creation. Slide Shows can be assembled from any accessible media in the MediaServer and shared with other users of the system.Export to PowerPoint is a utility function to address the widespread use of PowerPoint in medical education and multimedia presentation. It allows Slide Shows to be converted to PowerPoint and downloaded to the client system for offline use, easing the process of assembling media and creating a PowerPoint document. This function leverages XML Web Services and the SOAP protocol to achieve the desired outputs.Teaching Files are used to illustrate a particular educational topic, and consist of a multi-page interface. Each page contains media and annotations specific to the educational topic at hand. Annotations are stored with the Teaching File and not with the collated media. Individual pages are assembled by choosing existing Slide Shows and further annotating the media.E-Books are web-based books built on a particular design template provided by the MediaServer. Authors can integrate media from the MediaServer into these e-Books, which are assembled through the use of 3rd party tools such as Macromedia Dreamweaver.MediaServer resources were deployed in a gross anatomy course through the use of these tools and integration with third party applications, including a three-dimensional stereo viewing system. This pilot project was well received by the course participants and evaluation of usage data is ongoing.These educational media tools must be further evaluated for their teaching efficacy. These tools will be evaluated with volunteer faculty contributing media and creating Slide Shows, PowerPoint documents, Teaching Files, and e-Books. These educational modules will then be used for medical school classes. Feedback will be integrated into further development of new educational tools, providing new views into the large Stanford MediaServer dataset.Access rights management and security is paramount for the protection of digital media. The existing MediaServer security system will be enhanced to address privacy concerns, while providing faculty the flexibility to appropriately create and share educational units with their students and colleagues. Standard APIs will also be created to allow third-party developers to access the media in the MediaServer and deliver it through their own web-based applications.This work was partially funded by gifts from the Yamazaki-Yang Family Foundation, the Siminoff Family Foundation, Sun Microsystems, and Silicon Graphics.},

year = {2003},
isbn = {0769519393},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {The current demand from non-experts who wish to build digital libraries is strong worldwide. However, since DLs are complex systems, it usually takes a huge amount of effort and time to create and tailor a digital library to satisfy specific needs and requirements of target communities/societies. What is desired is a simplified modeling process and rapid generation of digital libraries. To enable this, digital libraries should be modeled with descriptive domain-specific languages [1]. In a domain-specific modeling language, the models are made up of elements representing concepts, rules, and terminology that are part of the domain world, as opposed to the code world or generic modeling languages (e.g., UML [2]). A visual modeling tool would be helpful to non-experts so they may model a digital library without knowing the theoretical foundations and the syntactical details of the descriptive language.In this demonstration, we present a domain-specific visual modeling tool, 5SGraph, aimed at modeling digital libraries. 5SGraph is based on a metamodel that describes DLs using the 5S theory [3]. The output from 5SGraph is a digital library model that is an instance of the metamodel, expressed in the 5S description language (5SL) [4].5SGraph presents the metamodel in a structured toolbox, and provides a top-down visual building environment for designers (see Figure 1). The visual proximity of the metamodel and instance model facilitates requirements gathering and simplifies the modeling process. Furthermore, 5SGraph maintains semantic constraints specified by the 5S metamodel and enforces these constraints over the instance model to ensure semantic consistency and correctness. 5SGraph enables component reuse to reduce the time and efforts of designers. 5SGraph also is designed to be flexible and extensible, able to accommodate and integrate several other complementary tools (e.g., to model scenarios or complex digital objects), reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of digital libraries. The tool has been tested with real users and several modeling tasks in a usability experiment [5] and its usefulness and learnability have been demonstrated.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {The International Technology Education (ITEA), in partnership with the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse (ENC) and funded by the National Science Foundation has created a comprehensive digital library collection for K-12 technological literacy in an accessible virtual environment. ICON, or the Innovation Curriculum Online Network, is a central source for information dealing with technology and innovation.ICON serves as a national electronic roadmap to connect users, such as teachers, professors, students, museum staff, and parents with information about our human built and innovated world. Users may use the digital library to access resources ranked according to technological literacy content and pedagogy, interact with quality instructional resources, and to enhance online search capabilities relevant to the needs of the user population. The focused digital library contains online resources including websites, electronic files, information about professional organizations, government agencies, public and private foundations, and commercial enterprises. Identification and selection of these resources are in alignment with national standards, grade and age level appropriateness, sound instructional and disciplinary content, and current availability of and access to materials.ENC has built a robust electronic infrastructure to support: the development of relevant and appropriate metadata (in conjunction with other synergistic NSDL projects); the processing of records and abstracts; the development of value-added user interfaces; and the maintenance of computer services for optimum and continuous digital library operations. An advisory board is providing annual input into digital library development and identification of quality digital resources. Formal evaluation of the ICON project is being conducted by Horizon Research.Field testing of the collection and its services is being undertaken with diverse groups of users to evaluate ease of navigation and discovery of content-rich, pedagogically sound resources.A variety of methods of sustainability for the collection are being explored including public and/or private sponsorship and subscriber support. ICON was officially launched March 2003 (<u>www.icontechlit.org</u>) and presented in a special interest session on March 13, 2003 at the ITEA Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. Currently, ICON has established tools for simple search, advance search, and browse by technology concepts. The technology concepts are classified and based from the National Standards for Technological Literacy initially driven by the Technology for All Americans Project (<u>http://www.iteawww.org/TAA/Listing.htm</u>). Continuous user feedback will be monitored through a "contact us" link established to receive not only communications on problems with the digital library but to allow user questions and site evaluations. Users may also "Suggest a Resource" to ICON to be considered for inclusion in the collection.},

abstract = {Conventionally, digital museum online exhibitions are constructed using handcrafted HTML pages which require tedious hypermedia composing. This paper proposes a sophisticated modularization framework for exhibition website construction by integrating XML and Flash MX. A typical exhibition page is differentiated into several "layers" containing specific types of "media elements". Several categories of modularized Flash-based "mediah-andlers" are used to process and present the layers containing media elements. A complete set of media-handlers presenting the content are then integrated together to give the final page presentation. Based on this modularization framework, the workflow for exhibition construction and management are significant improved.},

abstract = {THREDDS (THematic Real-time Earth Distributed Data Servers) services catalog geophysical data and other data services to support discovery and use by researchers. THREDDS, however, doesn't support data discovery and use by learners and educators (i.e. novices). Educational digital libraries, like DLESE (Digital Library for Earth System Eduation) provide rich metadata descriptions that are effective in helping novices locate and use most types of learning resources. DLESE, however, doesn't provide a way for novices to discover geophysical data in immediately usable forms. The VGEE (Visual Geophysical Exploration Environment) supports novices' discovery and use of geophysical data by linking THREDDS services with educational curricula and learner-centered data tools. The curricula are cataloged in DLESE and so can be discovered in educational settings. These curricula then guide novices to the appropriate tools and illustrate meaningful use of the data. More generally, by coupling data to curricular documents, text-based discovery tools (e.g. search engines) can be extended to data.},

title = {An XQuery Engine for Digital Library Systems},
year = {2003},
isbn = {0769519393},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {XML is now a standard markup language for web information. Many application areas are producing XML documents on the web. This situation urges digital library systems to deal with not only typical text documents but also XML documents. XML documents are semi-structured. Some queries based on the structures are useful and necessary.MPEG-7 is a metadata standard for multimedia objects. MPEG-7 metadata can describe some features such as color histogram of image, so that a multimedia digital library system using MPEG-7 for metadata representation can provide content-based search for multimedia objects. MPEG-7 is defined by XML schema. In order to retrieve MPEG-7 metadata, a query language for XML data is required.A standard query language is very helpful for interoperability among digital library systems over the Internet. XQuery, which has been influenced from most of the previous XML query languages, is a forthcoming standard for querying XML data.In this paper we propose an XQuery Engine as depicted in the figure that can be used as an XQuery processing module in a digital library system that supports XML documents. We assume generic digital library system architecture. It consists of four modules: a user interface, an XQuery Engine, an Information retrieval Engine, and an XML Repository. The user interface module gives a user an easy way to search XML documents and transforms a given user query to an equivalent XQuery. The XQuery Engine module takes an XQuery as input and provides a query plan for an information retrieval module as output. The information retrieval engine executes a query plan by communicating with the XML repository, which stores XML documents.The XQuery Engine parses an input XQuery and constructs a syntax tree for the query. Then, it transforms the syntax tree into a query plan, called a Primitive Operation Tree (POT). Each node of a POT represents an atomic operation in terms of the information retrieval engine and can be interpreted and processed by the information retrieval engine. The result set is given back to the XQuery engine, which in turn transforms the result into an XML document of the form being required by the user interface. The final result in XML is returned back to the user interface.Our approach has the following useful aspects. First, any user interface that generates XQuery is able to access any digital library system including our XQuery Engine. Second, we define a set of primitive operations for POTs so that they can become a standard interface between an XQuery Engine and an Information Retrieval Engine for our generic digital library system that supports XML documents. Third, some query optimizations over POTs can be done in the XQuery Engine so that better searching performance is expected.Currently we are developing an XQuery Engine prototype. It will be installed inside an MPEG-7 based Digital Library System that supports content-based searching for images. The XQuery Specification is an ongoing working draft and is not completed yet. Since the current version of the XQuery specification does not define full functions for information retrieval, we need to extend XQuery syntax by adding some functions such as rankby().},

The project, funded by a two-year U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grant, will enhance access to the BNM Media Collection. The Media Collection is in great demand, and the pressures of human use exacerbate an already tenuous situation for the long-term preservation of the images. While digitization is not viewed as the preservation solution, it will assist the Museum to lessen the impact of human handling. By making the Media Collection more accessible through integration of the PCC Library's online catalog, a much wider audience will be reached, and mishandling of the original images will be significantly reduced.The PCC website, currently under final development will link the Library WebCollection Plus which will contain digitized images selected from the extensive photo archives, as well as digitized images of the ethnographic and other objects in the Museum's collection, including contemporary art. This poster session will enable viewers to see the range of images included in the project.This poster presentation will enable researchers to learn how this project will support scholarly research.},

title = {Building a Meaningful Web: From Traditional Knowledge Organization Systems to New Semantic Tools},
year = {2003},
isbn = {0769519393},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (NKOS) workshop focused on the transformation of traditional knowledge organization systems (KOSs) to new forms of knowledge representation that are being developed to support a more semantic-based, meaningful Web environment. The goal of the workshop was to identify principles from more traditional practices that can contribute to the design of new knowledge organization systems and ways to exploit the extensive intellectual capital available in traditional KOSs when developing new KOS tools.Traditional KOSs include a broad range of system types from term lists to classification systems and complex thesauri. Term lists may be simple authority lists. Classification systems put resources in broad groups or "buckets". Traditional thesauri are built on broader-narrower, synonymous and associative (or related term) relationships. These and other traditional KOSs were developed in a print environment or in the early days of computerized databases to control the vocabulary used when indexing and searching a specific product, such as a bibliographic database, or when organizing a physical collection such as a library.New forms of knowledge representation include ontologies, topic maps, and other semantic Web components. The relationships between concepts in these tools are richer. In particular, the associative relationships and broader-narrower relationships are defined in more detail. New semantic tools emphasize the ability of the computer to process the KOS against a body of text, rather than support the human indexer or trained searcher. These tools are intended for use in the broader, more uncontrolled context of the Web to support information discovery by a larger community of interest or by Web users in general.While the traditional KOSs and newer tools are related, the development of the newer forms of KOS tools has, on the whole, not taken advantage of traditional KOSs. There is little understanding of how traditional tools can be transformed for the demands of the Web environment and whether there are lessons that can be learned from the decades of development and maintenance of these traditional systems.This workshop compared the traditional KOSs and new approaches to improving the semantic capabilities of the Web. Best practices and lessons learned from the development, maintenance and use of traditional KOSs were identified. Descriptions of projects involving the transformation of traditional KOSs to newer forms emphasized the transition process, including the analysis of the traditional KOS, and the characteristics of the KOS that could be carried through to the new tool. The presenters also discussed the degree to which the traditional KOS and the new tool would be used together in the future, whether there would be parallel or separate maintenance activities, etc.Presenters described the development of specific Web service functionality applicable to KOSs. The benefits of this service-based approach and the possibility of universal or community-based KOS services were explored.In addition to formal presentations, the workshop participants gave brief updates on their work or interest in this area. A facilitated discussion identified areas where standards, best practices, technologies, or more research are needed to take advantage of the investment in traditional KOSs when developing new tools.NKOS is an ad hoc group devoted to the discussion of KOSs as networked interactive information services to support the description and retrieval of diverse information resources through the Internet. This is the 6th in a series of NKOS workshops held in conjunction with JCDL. More information about NKOS is available from <u>http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/.</u>},
