abstract = {We propose a Bayesian extension to the ad-hoc Language Model. Many smoothed estimators used for the multinomial query model in ad-hoc Language Models (including Laplace and Bayes-smoothing) are approximations to the Bayesian predictive distribution. In this paper we derive the full predictive distribution in a form amenable to implementation by classical IR models, and then compare it to other currently used estimators. In our experiments the proposed model outperforms Bayes-smoothing, and its combination with linear interpolation smoothing outperforms all other estimators.},

abstract = {We present a non-traditional retrieval problem we call subtopic retrieval. The subtopic retrieval problem is concerned with finding documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic. In such a problem, the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking, violating the assumption of independent relevance which is assumed in most traditional retrieval methods. Subtopic retrieval poses challenges for evaluating performance, as well as for developing effective algorithms. We propose a framework for evaluating subtopic retrieval which generalizes the traditional precision and recall metrics by accounting for intrinsic topic difficulty as well as redundancy in documents. We propose and systematically evaluate several methods for performing subtopic retrieval using statistical language models and a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) ranking strategy. A mixture model combined with query likelihood relevance ranking is shown to modestly outperform a baseline relevance ranking on a data set used in the TREC interactive track.},

abstract = {Much work in information retrieval focuses on using a model of documents and queries to derive retrieval algorithms. Model based development is a useful alternative to heuristic development because in a model the assumptions are explicit and can be examined and refined independent of the particular retrieval algorithm. We explore the explicit assumptions underlying the na\"{\i}ve framework by performing computational analysis of actual corpora and queries to devise a generative document model that closely matches text. Our thesis is that a model so developed will be more accurate than existing models, and thus more useful in retrieval, as well as other applications. We test this by learning from a corpus the best document model. We find the learned model better predicts the existence of text data and has improved performance on certain IR tasks.},

We have experimented with five machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using two kinds of features: bag-of-words and bag-of-ngrams. The experiment results show that with only surface text features the SVM outperforms the other four methods for this task. Further, we propose to use a special kernel function called the tree kernel to enable the SVM to take advantage of the syntactic structures of questions. We describe how the tree kernel can be computed efficiently by dynamic programming. The performance of our approach is promising, when tested on the questions from the TREC QA track.},

We present three important findings: Boolean querying schemes perform well in the question answering task. The performance differences between various passage retrieval algorithms vary with the choice of document retriever, which suggests significant interactions between document retrieval and passage retrieval. The best algorithms in our evaluation employ density-based measures for scoring query terms. Our results reveal future directions for passage retrieval and question answering.},

We need different strategies to find target documents according to a query type. We can classify user queries as three categories, the topic relevance task, the homepage finding task, and the service finding task. In this paper, a user query classification scheme is proposed. This scheme uses the difference of distribution, mutual information, the usage rate as anchor texts, and the POS information for the classification. After we classified a user query, we apply different algorithms and information for the better results. For the topic relevance task, we emphasize the content information, on the other hand, for the homepage finding task, we emphasize the Link information and the URL information. We could get the best performance when our proposed classification method with the OKAPI scoring algorithm was used.},

First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation.},

The results showed that while users were able to successfully search on the basis of colour, and were able to formulate visual queries, their ability to do so was affected by search task type. Search task type was also shown to be related to search tool choice. However, the results of study two showed that while users were able to complete all of the tasks, there was evidence to suggest that a degree of compromise was present in the users' choice of image that was largely due to problems relating to query formulation.},

By providing a formal analysis of the computational complexity of each classification method, followed by an investigation on the usage of different classifiers in a hierarchical setting of categorization, we show how the scalability of a method depends on the topology of the hierarchy and the category distributions. In addition, we are able to obtain tight bounds for the complexities by using the power law to approximate category distributions over a hierarchy.

However, the quality of the probability estimates is crucial. We review a variety of standard approaches to converting scores (and poor probability estimates) from text classifiers to high quality estimates and introduce new models motivated by the intuition that the empirical score distribution for the "extremely irrelevant", "hard to discriminate", and "obviously relevant" items are often significantly different. Finally, we analyze the experimental performance of these models over the outputs of two text classifiers. The analysis demonstrates that one of these models is theoretically attractive (introducing few new parameters while increasing flexibility), computationally efficient, and empirically preferable.},

abstract = {Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing and then later retrieving their image collections. However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval.},

To investigate these hypotheses, we present a mixture-based language model and also examine many of the current meta-search algorithms. We find that compatible output from systems is important for successful combination of document representations. We also demonstrate that combining low performing document representations can improve performance, but not consistently. We find that the techniques best suited for this task are robust to the inclusion of poorly performing document representations. We also explore the role of variance of results across systems and its impact on the performance of fusion, with the surprising result that the correct documents have higher variance across document representations than highly ranking incorrect documents.},

abstract = {Most of the work on XML query and search has stemmed from the publishing and database communities, mostly for the needs of business applications. Recently, the Information Retrieval community began investigating the XML search issue to answer information discovery needs. Following this trend, we present here an approach where information needs can be expressed in an approximate manner as pieces of XML documents or "XML fragments" of the same nature as the documents that are being searched. We present an extension of the vector space model for searching XML collections via XML fragments and ranking results by relevance. We describe how we have extended a full-text search engine to comply with this model. The value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high precision of our system, which was among the top performers in the recent INEX workshop. Our results indicate that certain queries are more appropriate than others for the extended vector space model. Specifically, queries with relatively specific contexts but vague information needs are best situated to reap the benefit of this model. Finally our results show that one method may not fit all types of queries and that it could be worthwhile to use different solutions for different applications.},

abstract = {A novel maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning approach to text categorization is proposed. Different from the conventional techniques, the proposed MFoM method attempts to integrate any performance metric of interest (e.g. accuracy, recall, precision, or F1 measure) into the design of any classifier. The corresponding classifier parameters are learned by optimizing an overall objective function of interest. To solve this highly nonlinear optimization problem, we use a generalized probabilistic descent algorithm. The MFoM learning framework is evaluated on the Reuters-21578 task with LSI-based feature extraction and a binary tree classifier. Experimental results indicate that the MFoM classifier gives improved F1 and enhanced robustness over the conventional one. It also outperforms the popular SVM method in micro-averaging F1. Other extensions to design discriminative multiple-category MFoM classifiers for application scenarios with new performance metrics could be envisioned too.},

The utilized concepts are automatically extracted from documents via probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We propose to use AdaBoost to optimally combine weak hypotheses based on both types of features. Experimental results on standard benchmarks confirm the validity of our approach, showing that AdaBoost achieves consistent improvements by including additional semantic features in the learned ensemble.},

Results show that the specific technique results in longer queries than a standard query elicitation technique, that this technique is indeed usable, that the technique results in increased user satisfaction with the search, and that query length is positively correlated with user satisfaction with the search.},

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells.},

We also developed a second set of "inexpensive" topics based on categories in the document collection. We found that the initial judgments made for the experiment were sufficient; subsequent pooled judging changed system rankings very little.

Each community is characterized by a Gaussian distribution on the normalized ratings for each item. The normalization of ratings is performed in a user-specific manner to account for variations in absolute shift and variance of ratings.

Under this approach, relationships among data objects are used to improve the cluster quality of interrelated data objects through an iterative reinforcement clustering process. At the same time, the link structure derived from relationships of the interrelated data objects is used to differentiate the importance of objects and the learned importance is also used in the clustering process to further improve the clustering results. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only effectively overcomes the problem of data sparseness caused by the high dimensional relationship space but also significantly improves the clustering accuracy.},

Currently little work has been done on automatic music genre classification, and in addition, the reported classification accuracies are relatively low. This paper proposes a new feature extraction method for music genre classification, DWCHs. DWCHs stands for Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms. DWCHs capture the local and global information of music signals simultaneously by computing histograms on their Daubechies wavelet coefficients. Effectiveness of this new feature and of previously studied features are compared using various machine learning classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines and Linear Discriminant Analysis. It is demonstrated that the use of DWCHs significantly improves the accuracy of music genre classification.},

abstract = {In a federated digital library system, it is too expensive to query every accessible library. Resource selection is the task to decide to which libraries a query should be routed. Most existing resource selection algorithms compute a library ranking in a heuristic way. In contrast, the decision-theoretic framework (DTF) follows a different approach on a better theoretic foundation: It computes a selection which minimises the overall costs (e.g. retrieval quality, time, money) of the distributed retrieval. For estimating retrieval quality the recall-precision function is proposed. In this paper, we introduce two new methods: The first one computes the empirical distribution of the probabilities of relevance from a small library sample, and assumes it to be representative for the whole library. The second method assumes that the indexing weights follow a normal distribution, leading to a normal distribution for the document scores. Furthermore, we present the first evaluation of DTF by comparing this theoretical approach with the heuristical state-of-the-art system CORI; here we find that DTF outperforms CORI in most cases.},

abstract = {Prior research under a variety of conditions has shown the CORI algorithm to be one of the most effective resource selection algorithms, but the range of database sizes studied was not large. This paper shows that the CORI algorithm does not do well in environments with a mix of "small" and "very large" databases. A new resource selection algorithm is proposed that uses information about database sizes as well as database contents. We also show how to acquire database size estimates in uncooperative environments as an extension of the query-based sampling used to acquire resource descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the database size estimates are more accurate for large databases than estimates produced by a competing method; the new resource ranking algorithm is always at least as effective as the CORI algorithm; and the new algorithm results in better document rankings than the CORI algorithm.},

The key idea is to arrange participating sites in a topic-segmented overlay topology in which most connections are short-distance, connecting pairs of sites with similar content. Topically focused sets of sites are then joined together into a single network by long-distance links. Queries are matched and routed to only the topically closest regions. We discuss a variety of design issues and tradeoffs that an implementor of SETS would face. We show that SETS is efficient in network traffic and query processing load.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel domain-independent text segmentation method, which identifies the boundaries of topic changes in long text documents and/or text streams. The method consists of three components: As a preprocessing step, we eliminate the document-dependent stop words as well as the generic stop words before the sentence similarity is computed. This step assists in the discrimination of the sentence semantic information. Then the cohesion information of sentences in a document or a text stream is captured with a sentence-distance matrix with each entry corresponding to the similarity between a sentence pair. The distance matrix can be represented with a gray-scale image. Thus, a text segmentation problem is converted into an image segmentation problem. We apply the anisotropic diffusion technique to the image representation of the distance matrix to enhance the semantic cohesion of sentence topical groups as well as sharpen topical boundaries. At last, the dynamic programming technique is adapted to find the optimal topical boundaries and provide a zoom-in and zoom-out mechanism for topics access by segmenting text in variable numbers of sentence topical groups. Our approach involves no domain-specific training, and it can be applied to texts in a variety of domains. The experimental results show that our approach is effective in text segmentation and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

The effectiveness of the technique was evaluated empirically using five source languages and English as a target language. The target word list contained 189 000 English words with the correct equivalents for the source words among them. The source words were translated using the two-step fuzzy translation technique, and the results were compared with those of plain fuzzy matching based translation. The combined technique performed better, sometimes considerably better, than fuzzy matching alone.},

A phonetic English dictionary and a set of probabilistic mapping rules are used for automatically generating transliteration candidates. A monolingual Japanese corpus is then used for automatically validating the transliterated terms. We evaluate the usage of the extracted English-Japanese transliteration pairs with Japanese to English retrieval experiments over the CLEF bilingual test collections. The use of our automatically derived extension to a bilingual translation dictionary improves average precision, both before and after pseudo-relevance feedback, with gains ranging from 2.5% to 64.8%.},

They demonstrated that the system evaluations produced by their methodology are correlated with actual evaluations using relevance judgments in the TREC competition. In this work, we propose an explanation for this phenomenon. We devise a simple measure for quantifying the similarity of retrieval systems by assessing the similarity of their retrieved results. Then, given a collection of retrieval systems and their retrieved results, we use this measure to assess the average similarity of a system to the other systems in the collection. We demonstrate that evaluating retrieval systems according to average similarity yields results quite similar to the methodology proposed by Soboroff et~al., and we further demonstrate that these two techniques are in fact highly correlated. Thus, the techniques are effectively evaluating and ranking retrieval systems by "popularity" as opposed to "performance.},

Previous experiments show that differences in human relevance assessments do not affect the relative performance of retrieval systems. Based on this observation, we propose and evaluate a new approach to replace the human relevance judgments by an automatic method. Ranking of retrieval systems with our methodology correlates positively and significantly with that of human-based evaluations. In the experiments, we assume a Web-like imperfect environment: the indexing information for all documents is available for ranking, but some documents may not be available for retrieval. Such conditions can be due to document deletions or network problems. Our method of simulating imperfect environments can be used for Web search engine assessment and in estimating the effects of network conditions (e.g., network unreliability) on IR system performance.},

The implementation is based on the Hedge algorithm for online learning, which has the advantage of convergence to bounded error rates approaching the performance of the best linear combination of the underlying systems. The choice of a loss function closely related to the average precision measure of system performance ensures that the judged document set performs well, both in constructing a metasearch list and as a pool for the accurate evaluation of retrieval systems. Our experimental results on TREC data demonstrate excellent performance in all measures---evaluation of systems, retrieval of relevant documents, and generation of metasearch lists.},

We present a new approach to classify images based on the combination of image processing techniques and hybrid neural networks.

The first classifier, a self-organising map (SOM) clusters similar images based on the extracted features. Then, regions of the representative images of these clusters were labeled and used to train the second classifier, composed of several support vector machines (SVMs).

It is useful to model and automate term deletion when arbitrary searches are conjunctively matched against a small hand constructed collection, such as a hand-built hierarchy, or collection of high-quality pages matched with key phrases. Queries with no matches can have words deleted till a match is obtained. We provide algorithms which perform substantially better than the baseline in predicting which word should be deleted from a reformulated query, for increasing query coverage in the context of web search on small high-quality collections.},

This begets the question as to what are the chief points in the source text and how is this information used in itself in identifying the source text. This is crucially important when we discuss automatic evaluation of summaries. So the question of main points is the source text. Typically, this would be around a nucleus of keywords. However, the salience, the frequency, and the relationship of the text with other texts in the collection (of these keywords is perhaps) are important. Text categorisation using neural networks explicates these points well and also has a practical impact.},

The developed component can be used either as an internal slave component or as an external co-processor and is efficient in resource demands as the component controllers take only a minimal percentage of the target device space leaving the majority of the space to term and posting entries. A Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is used to model the HAT system.},

Terms are extracted from positive examples in training data based on several alternative term-selection algorithms, then combined additively after a simple term-score normalization step to produce a merged and ranked master term vector. The score threshold for the master vector is set via beta-gamma regulation over all the available training data. The process avoids para-meter calibrations and protracted training. It also results in compact profiles for run-time evaluation of test (new) documents. Results on TREC-2002 filtering-task datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over TREC-median results and rival both idealized IR-based results and optimized (and expensive) SVM-based classifiers in general effectiveness.},
