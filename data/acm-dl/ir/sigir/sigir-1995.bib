abstract = {Information retrieval systems are being challenged to manage
larger and larger document collections. In an effort to provide
better retrieval performance on large collections, more
sophisticated retrieval techniques have been developed that support
rich, structured queries. Structured queries are not amenable to
previously proposed optimization techniques. Optimizing execution,
however, is even more important in the context of large document
collections. We present a new structured query optimization
technique which we have implemented in an inference network-based
information retrieval system. Experimental results show that query
evaluation time can be reduced by more than half with little impact
on retrieval effectiveness.},
