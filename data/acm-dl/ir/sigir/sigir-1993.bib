abstract = {Relevance feedback, which modifies queries using judgements of the relevance of a few, highly-ranked documents, has historically been an important method for increasing the performance of information retrieval systems. In this paper, we extend the inference network model introduced by Turtle and Croft to include relevance feedback techniques. The difference between relevance feedback on text abstracts and full text collections is studied. Preliminary results for relevance feedback on the structured queries supported by the inference net model are also reported.},

Toward this end, we discuss the merits of imposing structure on full-length text documents; that is, a partition of the text into coherent multi-paragraph units that represent the pattern of subtopics that comprise the text. Using this structure, we can make a distinction between the main topics, which occur throughout the length of the text, and the subtopics, which are of only limited extent. We discuss why recognition of subtopic structure is important and how, to some degree of accuracy, it can be found. We describe a new way of specifying queries on full-length documents  and then describe an experiment in which making use of the recognition of local structure achieves better results on a typical information retrieval task than does a standard IR measure.},

Using these compression methods on two different text sources (the King James Version of the Bible and a sample of Wall Street Journal Stories), the compressed index occupies less than 40% of the size of the original text, even when both stopwords and numbers are included in the index. The decreased time required for I/O can almost fully compensate for the time needed to uncompress the postings.

abstract = {Our analysis combines the concerns of signature extraction and signature file organization which have usually been treated as separate issues. We also relax the uniform frequency and single term query assumptions and provide a comprehensive analysis for multiterm query environments where terms can be classified based on their query and database occurrence frequencies. The performance of three superimposed signature generation schemes is explored as they are applied to one dynamic signature file organization based on linear hashing: Linear Hashing with Superimposed Signatures (LHSS). First scheme (SM) allows all terms set the same number of bits regardless of their discriminatory power whereas the second and third methods (MMS and MMM) emphasize the terms with high query and low database occurrence frequencies. Of these three schemes, only MMM takes the probability distribution of the number of query terms into account in finding the optimal mapping strategy. Derivation of performance evaluation formulas is provided together with the results of various experimental settings. Suggestions as to how to implement the given techniques in real life cases are also provided. Results indicate that MMM outperforms the other methods as the gap between the discriminatory power of the terms gets larger. The absolute value of the savings provided by MMM reach a maximum for the high query weight case. However, the extra savings decline sharply for high weight and moderately for the low weight queries with the increase in database size.},

In this paper we present a technique to identify “natural” clusters in a hypertext. A natural cluster is a cluster that is not arbitrary, but depends only on intrinsic properties of the hypertext. In our case, the property we will use to identify the clusters is the number of independent paths between nodes. Using the graph theoretic definition of k-edge-components we present an aggregation technique to cluster the nodes. We then use this techniques to cluster three medium sized hypertexts that were developed by different authors for different users, using different methodologies. We also show how to use clustering to improve data display, browsing and retrieval.},

abstract = {There has been a great deal of interest within the Information Retrieval community in evaluating the use of linguistic knowledge to improve the indexing and searching of textual databases. Such systems must often employ a lexicon to store information about the words and phrases comprising the application's domain. Unlike a static lexicon, a dynamic lexicon raises practical concerns about the coordination between the state of the lexicon and IR indexing schemes based on lexical knowledge. Additionally, it introduces a host of database management issues, many of which are similar to those found in the text databases as well. In this paper, we explore a range of system design and performance issues that arise when integrating a dynamic lexicon with a  dynamic full-text information retrieval system. We observe that the principle of functional isolation argues against the use of language-dependent information in article indexes and favors the use of query-time strategies for applying lexical knowledge. We propose and evaluate a system architecture which embodies this principle. We also show how a storage and retrieval infrastructure based on Burkowski's [BURKOWSKI92] “containment model” abstraction can be employed to implement both the text retrieval and lexicon facilities required in an integrated system.},

In this paper we present a probabilistic query expansion model based on a similarity thesaurus which was constructed automatically. A similarity thesaurus reflects domain knowledge about the particular collection from which it is constructed. We address the two important issues with query expansion: the selection and the weighting of additional search terms. In contrast to earlier methods, our queries are expanded by adding those terms that are most similar to the concept of the query, rather than selecting terms that are similar to the query terms. Our experiments show that this kind of query expansion results in a notable improvement in the retrieval effectiveness when measured  using both recall-precision and usefulness.},

The result of the indexing procedure is a vector in which some of the terms represent word senses instead of word stems. Retrieval experiments comparing the effectivenss of these sense-based vectors vs. stem-based vectors show the stem-based vectors to be superior overall, although the sense-based vectors do improve the performance of some queries. The overall degradation is due in large part to the difficulty of disambiguating senses in short query statements. An analysis of these results suggests two conclusions: the IS-A links define a generalization/specialization hierarchy that is not sufficient to reliably select the correct sense of a noun from the set of fine sense distinctions in WordNet; and missing correct matches because of incorrect sense resolution has a much more deleterious effect on retrieval performance than does making spurious matches.},

The methods are illustrated in a broad domain: answering general-knowledge questions using an on-line encyclopedia.A closed-class question is a question stated in natural language, which assumes some definite answer typified by a noun phrase rather than a procedural answer. The methods hypothesize noun phrases that are likely to be the answer, and present the user with relevant text in which they are marked, focussing the user's attention appropriately. Furthermore, the sentences of matching text that are shown to the user are selected to confirm phrase relations implied by the question, rather than being selected solely on the basis of word  frequency.The corpus is accessed via an information retrieval (IR) system that supports boolean search with proximity constraints. Queries are automatically constructed from the phrasal content of the question, and passed to the IR system to find relevant text. Then the relevant text is itself analyzed; noun phrase hypotheses are extracted and new queries are independently made to confirm phrase relations for the various hypotheses.The methods are currently being implemented in a system called MURAX and although this process is not complete, it is sufficiently advanced for an interim evaluation to be presented.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new indexing method for Japanese text databases using the simple keyword string, in which a compound word is treated as a string of simple words, which are the smallest units in Japanese grammar which still maintain their meanings. This method allows retrieved texts to be ranked, according to the similarity of their meaning to the query, without using a control vocabulary or thesaurus. This paper also introduces the keyword feature, which describes the syntactic and semantic characteristics of a word, and results in more precise keyword extraction and text retrieval as well as simple dictionary maintenance.},

abstract = {A series of Japanese full-text retrieval experiments were conducted using an inference network document retrieval model. The retrieval performance of two major indexing methods, character-based and word-based, were evaluated. Using structured queries, the character-based indexing performed retrieval as well as, or slightly better, than the word-based system. This result has practical significance since the character-based indexing speed is considerably faster than the traditional word-based indexing. All the queries in this experiment were automatically formulated from natural language input.},

abstract = {Since 1986 we have investigated the problems and possibilities of applying modern information retrieval methods to large online public access library catalogs (OPACs). In the Retrieval Experiment—Virginia Tech OnLine Catalog (REVTOLC) study we carried out a large pilot test in 1987 and a larger, controlled investigation in 1990, with 216 users and roughly 500,000 MARC records. Results indicated that a forms-based interface coupled with vector and relevance feedback retrieval methods would be well received. Recent efforts developing the Multiple Access and Retrieval of Information with Annotations (MARIAN) system have involved used of a specially developed object-oriented DBMS, construction of a client running under NeXTSTEP, programming of a distributed server with a thread  assigned to each user session to increase concurrency on a small network of NeXTs, refinement of algorithms to use objects and stopping rules for greater efficiency, usability testing and iterative interface refinement.},

abstract = {The pile is a new element of the desktop user interface metaphor, designed to support the casual organization of documents. An interface design based on the pile concept suggested uses of content awareness for describing, organizing, and filing textual documents. We describe a prototype implementation of these capabilities, and give a detailed example of how they might appear to the user. We believe the system demonstrates how content awareness can be not only used in a computer filing system, but made an integral part of the user's experience.},

abstract = {This paper describes a unique example-based mapping method for document retrieval. We discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents. These connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents; therefore, they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users. We employ a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans, and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown. We tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of MEDLINE documents which has been used by other information retrieval systems for evaluations. The effectiveness of the LLSF mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests.},

abstract = {The retrieval models based on the extended boolean retrieval framework, e.g., the fuzzy set model and the extended boolean model have been proposed in the past to provide the conventional boolean retrieval system with the document ranking facility. However, due to undesirable properties of evaluation formulas for the AND and OR operations, the former generates incorrect ranked output in certain cases and the latter suffers from the complexity of computation. There have been a variety of fuzzy operators to replace the evaluation formulas. In this paper we first investigate the behavioral aspects of the fuzzy operators and address important issues to affect retrieval effectiveness. We then define an operator class called positively compensatory operators giving high retrieval effectiveness, and present a pair of positively compensatory operators providing high retrieval efficiency as well as high retrieval effectiveness. All the claims are justified through experiments.},
