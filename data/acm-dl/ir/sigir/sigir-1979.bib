A new strategy to solve this problem is developed. The approach is, in essence, a modification of the reproductive plan, a type of adaptive procedure devised by Holland [2], which embodies many principles found in the adaptation of natural systems through evolution. The proposed approach differs from conventional methods in the sense that the search through the space of possible solutions proceeds in a parallel fashion.The adaptive clustering strategy requires the specification of methods for the generation of an initial population of classifications, the parent selection, the modifications and the replacement of current classifications with new ones. The effects of changing several of these features are investigated. Experimental results show that it is possible to devise clustering strategies based on the principles of adaptation in natural systems that are both effective and efficient.},

abstract = {The Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) On-Line Personal Bibliographic Retrieval System was developed to assist researchers at the Center in managing personal or project-related collections of reference materials. The system supports on-line entry, storage, and retrieval of bibliographic citations for collections of books, journal articles, reprints, reports, manuscripts, other documents, and audio-visual materials.The NCCC system is intended for relatively small collections of materials (under 10,000 items) and is not intended to duplicate or compete in any way with MEDLARS, CANCERLINE, or any of the other on-line bibliographic retrieval services. It is similar in concept to Mitre's SHOEBOX (1), but is much less complex and requires far less computer resources. The major advantage of the NCCC system is that it is simple, small, and easy to use.None of the techniques used in developing the NCCC system is particularly new or innovative. Rather, several well-known approaches to bibliographic retrieval were combined to produce a system that was easy and inexpensive to develop and is easy and inexpensive to use. The system is now running on the Dartmouth College Computing system's equivalent of a Honeywell 66/DPS-3. The programs are all written in BASIC.},
