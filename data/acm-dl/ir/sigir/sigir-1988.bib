abstract = {Traditional information has relied on the extensive use of statistical parameters in the implementation of retrieval strategies. This paper sets out to investigate whether linguistic processes can be used as part of a document retrieval strategy. This is done by predefining a level of syntactic analysis of user queries only, to be used as part of the retrieval process. A large series of experiments on an experimental test collection are reported which use a parser for noun phrases as part of the retrieval strategy. The results obtained from the experiments do yield improvements in the level of retrieval effectiveness and given the crude linguistic process used and the way it was used on queries and not on document texts, suggests that the approach of using linguistic processing in retrieval, is valid.},

abstract = {This study investigated two hypotheses concerning the use of anaphors in information retrieval. The first hypothesis, that anaphors tend to refer to integral concepts rather than to peripheral concepts, was well supported. Two samples of documents, one in psychology and the other in computer science, were examined by subject experts who judged the centrality of phrases which were referred to anaphorically. The second hypothesis, that various term weighting schemes are affected differently by anaphoric resolution, was also well supported. It was found that schemes which incorporate document length into the calculations produce much smaller increases in term weights for terms occurring in anaphoric resolutions than do those which do not consider document length. It is concluded that although anaphoric resolution has potential for better representing the “aboutness” of a document, care must be taken in choosing both the anaphoric classes to be resolved and the term weighting schemes to be used in measuring a document's topicality.},

We provide an analysis of areas in which natural language and information retrieval come together, and describe a system that joins the two fields by combining technology, choice of application area, and knowledge acquisition techniques.},

Many studies aimed at the correction of typographical errors have been carried out, but relatively few tackle the problem of phonographic correction, and they are generally based on more or less ad hoc methods. We propose a mathematical framework for phonographic correction by defining a similarity relation between phonetically related substrings and a dissimilarity index between strings. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm for recognizing words in dictionaries from misspelt inputs including both typographical and phonographic errors.},

The author suggests that a possible avenue for improving full-text retrieval would include in-depth studies of the ways in which individual users cope with large amounts of written information, stored chiefly on paper in their offices. Relevant literature in cognitive psychology is reviewed and some recent and continuing studies are described that have used anthropological methods to approach this problem. It is argued that historians are a good group to study, due to their reliance on the examination and processing of texts, and the broad scope of their inquiries. Examinations of the ways in which this one group of information workers categorize documents could lead us to a better understanding of human problems in processing and retrieving textual information.},

abstract = {Knowledge Representation (KR) systems provide support for Artificial Intelligence systems that reason about relationships between objects in their domains of expertise. Because of their support for inference, KR systems appear to have potential to enrich the kind of retrievals that IR systems might make. Ironically, however, the most useful KR systems are limited to reasoning based on a rigid notion of validity, and thus are awkward to use when relevant but inexact retrievals are desired. We have been exploring the potential of a “connectionist” model—the Boltzmann Machine—to overcome this limitation. We report on a number of experiments in which we use a connectionist simulator to support similarity-based reasoning in a frame representation. We draw some tentative, mixed conclusions on the potential for a union of KR, IR, and connectionism.},

The first method is to estimate parameter values of two independence models in information retrieval — the binary independence model and the non-binary independence model. The parameters estimated here are used to calculate optimal weights for terms in a different set of queries. Performance of this estimation is compared to the inverse document frequency method, the cosine measure, and the statistical similarity measure. The second method is to learn optimal weights of the non-binary independence model adaptively by a learning formula. Experiments are performed on three different document collections CISI, MEDLARS, and CRN4NUL for both methods, and results are reported. Both methods show improvements compared to the existing weighting schemes. Experimental results show that the second method gives slightly better performance than the first one, and has simpler implementation.},

The concept space, locally derived from a thesaurus, is used to represent a query as well as documents retrieved in atomic concept units. Dependencies between the search terms are taken into account. The meanings of the query and the retrieved documents (results of Elementary Logical Conjuncts (ELCs)) are compared. The ranking method on the semantical level is used in connection with existing data of a classical IR system. The user enters queries without using complex Boolean expressions.},

Experiments indicate that regression methods can help predict relevance, given query-document similarity values for each concept type. After sampling and transformation of data, the coefficient of determination for the best model was .48 (.66) for ISI (CACM). Average precision for the two collections was 11% (31%) better for probabilistic feedback with all types versus with terms only.

For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described. Finally, the conditions of the application as well as problems of further development are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the ongoing research in the Active Data Bases project at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. In this project we are specifying and building a system that helps a user in his search for useful and interesting information in large, complex information systems. The system is able to do this, because it learns from the interaction about the users and the data it contains. The indications of the users are expressed in terms of interests in the data, which serve as building blocks for user and data models. These models are then used to improve the search for interesting data.},

abstract = {The concept of a large-scale information retrieval network incorporating heterogeneous retrieval systems and users is introduced, and the necessary components for enabling term-based searching of any database by untrained end-users are outlined. We define a normal form for expression of queries, show that such queries can be automatically produced, if necessary, from a natural-language request for information, and give algorithms for translating such queries, with little or no loss of expressiveness, into equivalent queries on both Boolean and term-vector type retrieval systems. We conclude with a proposal for extending this approach to arbitrary database models.},

abstract = {Planning the evaluation of an information retrieval system involves two steps: first, a determination of performance descriptors and measures appropriate to the system objectives and, secondly, a development of an evaluation design which ensures the effect of variation in components of interest will be isolated and assessed in an unbiased fashion. This paper examines the question of retrieval system evaluation from the perspective of the user. It presents evaluation procedures which are appropriate to this perspective and which can be used to isolate the effect of variation in the user interface to the system. The general procedure is exemplified by an application to evaluation of an experimental OPAC interface.},

In particular, the problem of augmenting the capabilities of such interfaces with user modeling features is discussed and the main benefits of this approach are outlined. The paper presents a prototype system called IR-NLI II, devoted to model by means of artificial intelligence techniques the human intermediary to information retrieval systems. The overall organization of the IR-NLI II system is presented, together with a short description of the two main modules implemented so far, namely the Information Retrieval Expert Subsystem and the User Modeling Subsystem. An example of interaction with IR-NLI II is described. Perspectives and future research directions are finally outlined.},

abstract = {Efficiency in databases is a major requirement. This paper presents some solutions to cope with this problem. One solution is to execute operations in parallel: this is done in the “Delta Driven Computer” DDC, which is a multiprocessor machine with distributed memory dedicated to relational and deductive databases. In DDC, relations are distributed among the nodes of the machine, and the data are processed asynchronously in each node. To do that in an efficient way, a coprocessor, specialized for relational operations, is also proposed. It is called μSyC, for “microprogrammable Symbolic Coprocessor”. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part describes DDC, presenting the architecture, the languages, and an original computational model. The second part describes μSyC, its architecture, instruction set and the data structures used at the μSyC level.},

abstract = {Up to now, most of the retrieving systems are founded on a Boolean selection mechanism. It appears that this way of doing is not powerful enough to deal with some applications, especially when the size (number) of the results must be controlled. In that case, some kind of flexibility is needed in query expression. In this paper, we suggest the use of a fuzzy sets based approach. The basic principles of this approach are presented and compared to more conventional solutions providing only limited extensions. Moreover, the implementation aspects related to our approach are discussed to show that reasonable performances can be expected.},
