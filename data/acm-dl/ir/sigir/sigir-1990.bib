abstract = {This paper focuses on the query processing module of RIME, an experimental prototype of an intelligent information retrieval system designed to manage high-precision queries on a corpus of medical reports. Though highly specific this particular corpus is representative of an important class of applications: information retrieval among full-text specialized documents which constitute critical sources of information in several organizations (medicine, law, space industry…). This experience allowed us to design and implement an elaborate model for the semantic content of the documents which is an extension of the Conceptual Dependency approach. The underlying retrieval model is inspired from the Logic model proposed by C.J. Van Rijsbergen, which has been considerably refined using an Extended Modal Logic. After presenting the context of the RIME project, we briefly describe the models designed for the internal representation of medical reports and queries. The main part of the paper is then devoted to the retrieval model and its application to the query processing module of RIME which has a natural language interface. Processing a query involves two main phases: the interpretation which transforms the natural language query into a search expression, and the evaluation phases which retrieves the corresponding medical reports. We focus here on the evaluation phases and show its relationship with the underlying retrieval model. Evaluations from practical experiments are also given, along with indications about current developments of the project.},

Hypertext technologies enable users to impose many structures on document sets and, consequently, provide many paths to desired information, but they require that users work their way through some structure. Full-text search eliminates this requirement by ignoring structure altogether. The search strategy can also be restricted to work within specified contexts. The architecture provided for search readily supports automatic linking. These ideas have been tested in IRIS Intermedia.},

Prior studies have recognized the information specialists' role in helping searchers articulate and refine queries. Using a semantic network and a Problem Behavior Graph to represent the online search process, our study revealed that searchers also refined their own queries in an online task environment. The information retrieval system played a passive role in assisting online query refinement, which was, however, or that confirmed Taylor's four-level query formulation model. Based on our empirical findings, we proposed using a process model to facilitate and improve query refinement in an online environment. We believe incorporating this model into retrieval systems can result in the design of more “intelligent” and useful information retrieval systems.},

abstract = {A signature file acts as a filtering mechanism to reduce the amount of data that needs to be searched during query evaluation. Even though several techniques for organizing and searching signature files have been proposed in literature, they have serious limitations when applied to multimedia databases, where integrated access methods to text and image content are needed. A new signature technique, called Quick Filter, is proposed in the paper. According to this technique, signatures are divided into partitions, each of which holds signatures sharing the same characteristic key. As a result, it is possible to determine if the signatures in a partition satisfy a query by merely examining the key. Partitions not matching the key need not be searched. This method is based on dynamic hashing since signatures are hashed into partitions according to the keys and the file size, computed algorithmically from the signatures. Implementation of this technique is illustrated using an example and is verified by analytical performance evaluation. The result is a signature technique which satisfies the requirements for access methods in multimedia databases: dynamicity, with respect to insertions and updates, good query processing performance on large databases for high-weight queries.},

In addition, the expert system ranks the retrieved passages in decreasing order of probable relevance.Users' search performance using the expert system was compared with their search performance on their own, and their search performance using the online thesaurus. The following conclusions were reached: 1) The expert system significantly reduced the number of queries necessary to find relevant passages compared with the user searching alone or with the thesaurus. 2) The expert system produced marginally significant improvements in precision compared with the user searching on their own. There was no significant difference in the recall achieved by the three system configurations. 3) Overall, the expert system ranked relevant passages above irrelevant passages.},

Indeed, the algorithm described gives hash functions that are optimal in terms of time and hash table space utilization, and that preserve any a priori ordering desired. Furthermore, the resulting order preserving minimal perfect hash functions (OPMPHFs) can be found using space and time that is on average linear in the number of keys involved.},

First we regard one-dimensional dictionaries where the (non-trivial) terms occurring in the texts are to be included in the dictionary. Then we describe the case of two-dimensional dictionaries, which are needed for example for automatic indexing with a controlled vocabulary; here relationships between text terms and descriptors from the prescribed vocabulary have to be stored in the dictionary. For both cases, formulas for the interpolation and extrapolation with respect to different collection sizes are derived.We give experimental results for one-dimensional dictionaries and show how the completeness can be estimated and optimized.},

However, a major impediment to the use of the extended model is the construction of an extended query. In this paper, we describe a method for automatically extending a query containing only content terms (a single concept class) to a representation containing multiple concept classes. No relevance feedback is involved. Experiments using the CACM collection resulted in an average precision 34% better than that obtained using the standard single-concept term vector model.},

abstract = {Term clustering and syntactic phrase formation are methods for transforming natural language text. Both have had only mixed success as strategies for improving the quality of text representations for document retrieval. Since the strengths of these methods are complementary, we have explored combining them to produce superior representations. In this paper we discuss our implementation of a syntactic phrase generator, as well as our preliminary experiments with producing phrase clusters. These experiments show small improvements in retrieval effectiveness resulting from the use of phrase clusters, but it is clear that corpora much larger than standard information retrieval test collections will be required to thoroughly evaluate the use of this technique.},

abstract = {For free-text search over rapidly evolving corpora, dynamic update of inverted indices is a basic requirement. B-trees are an effective tool in implementing such indices. The Zipfian distribution of postings suggests space and time optimizations unique to this task. In particular, we present two novel optimizations, merge update, which performs better than straight forward block update, and pulsing which significantly reduces space requirements without sacrificing performance.},

abstract = {This paper describes algorithms and data structures for applying a parallel computer to information retrieval. Previous work has described an implementation based on overlap encoded signatures. That system was limited by 1) the necessity of keeping the signatures in primary memory, and 2) the difficulties involved in implementing document-term weighting. Overcoming these limitations requires adapting the inverted index techniques used on serial machines. The most obvious adaptation, also previously described, suffers from the fact that data must be sent between processors at query-time. Since interprocessor communication is generally slower than local computation, this suggests that an algorithm which does not perform such communication might be faster. This paper presents a data structure, called a partitioned posting file, in which the interprocessor communication takes place at database-construction time, so that no data movement is needed at query-time. Algorithms for constructing the data structure are also described. Performance characteristics and storage overhead are established by benchmarking against a synthetic database.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the implementation of a parallel text retrieval system using a microprocessor network. The system is designed to allow fast searching in document databases organised using the serial file structure, with a very rapid initial text signature search being followed by a more detailed, but more time-consuming, pattern matching search. The network is built from transputers, high performance microprocessors developed specifically for the construction of highly parallel computing systems, which are linked together in a processor farm. The paper discusses the design and implementation of processor farms, and then reports our initial studies of the efficiency of searching that can be achieved using this approach to text retrieval from serial files.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new method for information retrieval of documents that are represented by a vector. The novelty of the algorithm lies in the fact that no (generalized) p-norms are used as a matching function between the query and the document (as is done e.g. by Salton and others) but a function that measures the relative dispersion of the terms between a document and a query. This function originates from an earlier paper of the author where a good measure of relative concentration was introduced, used in informetrics to measure the degree of specialization of a journal w.r.t. the entire subject.This new information retrieval algorithm is shown to have many desirable properties (in the sense of the new Cater-Kraft wish list) including those of the original cosine-matching function of Salton. In addition the property of the cosine-matching function that, if one only uses weights 0 to 1, one is reduced to Boolean IR, is refined in the sense that one takes into consideration the broadness or specialization of a document and a query. Our new matching function satisfies these additional properties.},
