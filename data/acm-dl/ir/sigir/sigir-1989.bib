This paper describes the design of a user interface which permits gradual enlargement or refinement of the user's query by browsing through a graph of term and document subsets. This graph is obtained from a lattice automatically generated from the usual document-term relation. The major design features of the proposed interface are the integration of menu, fill-in the blank and direct manipulation modes of interaction within the “fisheye view” [Furnas, 1986] paradigm. A prototype user interface incorporating some of these ideas has been implemented on a microcomputer.The resulting interface is well adapted to various kinds of users and needs. More experienced users with a particular subject in mind can directly specify a query which results into a jump to a particular vertex in the graph. From there, the user can refine his initial query by browsing through the graph from that point on. On the other hand, casual users without any prior knowledge of the contents of the system or users without any particular subject in mind can freely navigate through the graph without ever specifying any query.},

EUROMATH is required to provide uniform retrieval facilities for searching in a user's personal data, in a shared database of structured documents and in public, bibliographic databases. The design of information retrieval facilities that satisfy these and other requirements posed several interesting design issues regarding the integration of various retrieval techniques. As well as a uniform query language, designed to be highly usable by the target user group, the retrieval facilities provide expert intermediary functions, i.e. sophisticated support for the retrieval of bibliographic data. This support is achieved using a model of the user, a model of the user's information need and a set of search strategies based on those used by human intermediaries. The expert intermediary facilities include extensive help facilities, automatic query reformulation and browsing of a variety of sources of query terms.},

First, it permits the employment of ranking strategies which cannot be easily implemented using signature files, specifically methods which depend on document-term weighting. Second, it permits the interactive searching of databases resident on secondary storage. The algorithm is evaluated via a mixture of analytic and simulation techniques, with a particular focus on how cost-effectiveness and efficiency change as the size of the database, number of processors, and cost of memory are altered. In particular, we find that if the ratio of the number of processors and/or disks to the size of the database is held constant, then the cost-effectiveness of the resulting system remains constant. Furthermore, for a given size of database, there is a number of processors which optimizes cost-effectiveness. Estimated response times are also presented.

abstract = {Hypertext offers users a simple, flexible way to navigate through electronic information systems but at the potential risk of becoming lost in the network of interconnected pieces of information. A study was conducted on information retrieval using a commercial hypertext based help system. It was found that the predominant search strategy was “browsing” (characterized by scanning tables of contents and paging through topics), rather than employing the indexes (“analytical search”). Although subjects did not become lost, individuals with better spatial visualization ability, as measured by a standardized test, were faster at retrieving information and returned to the top of the information hierarchy less often than those with poorer spatial visualization ability. These results support previous studies that have found a strong preference by users to browse in hypertext systems and extend those findings to a new domain (help), a different type of user interface, and a different information architecture. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of spatial visualization ability for efficient navigation and information retrieval in a hierarchical hypertext system.},

abstract = {Hypertext offers users a simple, flexible way to navigate through electronic information systems but at the potential risk of becoming lost in the network of interconnected pieces of information. A study was conducted on information retrieval using a commercial hypertext based help system. It was found that the predominant search strategy was “browsing” (characterized by scanning tables of contents and paging through topics), rather than employing the indexes (“analytical search”). Although subjects did not become lost, individuals with better spatial visualization ability, as measured by a standardized test, were faster at retrieving information and returned to the top of the information hierarchy less often than those with poorer spatial visualization ability. These results support previous studies that have found a strong preference by users to browse in hypertext systems and extend those findings to a new domain (help), a different type of user interface, and a different information architecture. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of spatial visualization ability for efficient navigation and information retrieval in a hierarchical hypertext system.},

abstract = {In organized health care, primary care is the first level. It is characterized by the wide span of health problems managed as well as remote location from traditional medical information and knowledge sources. The LIMEDS project has formulated the special requirements for integrated knowledge and data base management in primary care. This paper presents G\"{o}sta's book, a hypertext knowledge base implemented in LINCKS, an object oriented, networked database system. Firstly, aspects which make integrated hypermedia systems particularly suitable for application in primary health care are explored. We then describe the hypertext knowledge base, consisting of 500 basic text objects and 3000 links, and current implementations using the NODE data model. NODE is implemented on a SUN III fileserver, and the user interface for the hypertext context on Apple Macintosh (TM). Combination of design methods towards a parallel means-ends strategy was found to be necessary to achieve G\"{o}sta's book. Design groups need to be composed of computer science, medical, psychological and organizational competences.},

A number of setting relations are defined, these being based on the manipulations of the camera typically used in the production of the moving film: zooming in or out, panning etc.. An algorithm is presented which, given a limited level of initial specification by a describer, will constrain, where possible, the setting relations holding between all pairs of settings. The resulting network is called the settings structure. The paper begins by placing the settings structure into the context of its being one part of the CLORIS system.},
