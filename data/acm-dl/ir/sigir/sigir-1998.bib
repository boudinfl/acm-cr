abstract = {Two stages in measurement of techniques for information
retrieval are gathering of documents for relevance assessment and
use of the assessments to numerically evaluate effectiveness. We
consider both of these stages in the context of the TREC
experiments, to determine whether they lead to measurements that
are trustworthy and fair. Our detailed empirical investigation of
the TREC results shows that the measured relative performance of
systems appears to be reliable, but that recall is overestimated:
it is likely that many relevant documents have not been found. We
propose a new pooling strategy that can significantly in- crease
the number of relevant documents found for given effort, without
compromising fairness.},
