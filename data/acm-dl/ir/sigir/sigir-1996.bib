abstract = {A high performance information filtering system has three main
requirements: it must be effective in supplying users with useful
information, it must do so in a timely fashion, and it must be able
to handle a large throughput of information and a large number of
user profiles efficiently. These three requirements pose a
difficult problem, and to our knowledge no existing system is
capable of meeting all three. In this paper we describe a system
which combines a number of techniques from other information
retrieval and filtering systems, and is capable of providing high
performance on a typical workstation platform. We provide estimates
of computing resource usage, and show that our system is also
scalable.},
