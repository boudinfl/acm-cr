abstract = {This paper presents a novel prototype hierarchy based clustering (PHC) framework for the organization of web collections. It solves simultaneously the problem of categorizing web collections and interpreting the clustering results for navigation. By utilizing prototype hierarchies and the underlying topic structures of the collections, PHC is modeled as a multi-criterion optimization problem based on minimizing the hierarchy evolution, maximizing category cohesiveness and inter-hierarchy structural and semantic resemblance. The flexible design of metrics enables PHC to be a general framework for applications in various domains. In the experiments on categorizing 4 collections of distinct domains, PHC achieves 30% improvement in ¼F1 over the state-of-the-art techniques. Further experiments provide insights on performance variations with abstract and concrete domains, completeness of the prototype hierarchy, and effects of different combinations of optimization criteria.},

abstract = {The ability of fast similarity search at large scale is of great importance to many Information Retrieval (IR) applications. A promising way to accelerate similarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance, obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper, we emphasise this issue and propose a novel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing: we first find the optimal l-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning, and then train l classifiers via supervised learning to predict the l-bit code for any query document unseen before. Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.},

Task stage has been shown to influence search behaviors including usefulness judgments, as has task type. This paper reports on an investigation of how task stage and task type may help predict usefulness from the time that users spend on retrieved documents, over the course of several information seeking episodes. A 3-stage controlled experiment was conducted with 24 participants, each coming 3 times to work on 3 sub-tasks of a general task, couched either as "parallel" or "dependent" task type. The full task was to write a report on the general topic, with interim documents produced for each sub-task. Results show that task stage can help in inferring document usefulness from decision time, especially in the parallel task. The findings can be used to increase accuracy in predicting document usefulness and accordingly in personalizing search for multi-session tasks.},

In a user study in which participants were given difficult information seeking tasks, half of all queries submitted resulted in some degree of self-reported frustration. A third of all successful tasks involved at least one instance of frustration. By modeling searcher frustration, search engines can predict the current state of user frustration and decide when to intervene with alternative search strategies to prevent the user from becoming more frustrated, giving up, or switching to another search engine. We present several models to predict frustration using features extracted from query logs and physical sensors. We are able to predict frustration with a mean average precision of 65% from the physical sensors, and 87% from the query log features.},

abstract = {We investigate how people interact with Web search engine result pages using eye-tracking. While previous research has focused on the visual attention devoted to the 10 organic search results, this paper examines other components of contemporary search engines, such as ads and related searches. We systematically varied the type of task (informational or navigational), the quality of the ads (relevant or irrelevant to the query), and the sequence in which ads of different quality were presented. We measured the effects of these variables on the distribution of visual attention and on task performance. Our results show significant effects of each variable. The amount of visual attention that people devote to organic results depends on both task type and ad quality. The amount of visual attention that people devote to ads depends on their quality, but not the type of task. Interestingly, the sequence and predictability of ad quality is also an important factor in determining how much people attend to ads. When the quality of ads varied randomly from task to task, people paid little attention to the ads, even when they were good. These results further our understanding of how attention devoted to search results is influenced by other page elements, and how previous search experiences influence how people attend to the current page.},

Predicting which types of documents a user is looking for in the context of a given query is a crucial part of providing effective desktop search. The problem is similar to selecting resources in distributed IR, but there are some important differences.In this paper, we quantify the impact of type prediction in producing a merged ranking for desktop search and introduce a new prediction method that exploits type-specific metadata. In addition, we show that type prediction performance and search effectiveness can be further enhanced by combining existing methods of type prediction using discriminative learning models. Our experiments employ pseudo-desktop collections and a human computation game for acquiring realistic and reusable queries.},

Examples of match-making systems include dating services, resume/job bulletin boards, community based question answering, and consumer-to-consumer marketplaces. One fundamental component of a match-making system is the retrieval and ranking of candidate matches for a given user. We present the first in-depth study of information retrieval approaches applied to match-making systems. Specifically, we focus on retrieval for a dating service. This domain offers several unique problems not found in traditional information retrieval tasks. These include two-sided relevance, very subjective relevance, extremely few relevant matches, and structured queries. We propose a machine learned ranking function that makes use of features extracted from the uniquely rich user profiles that consist of both structured and unstructured attributes. An extensive evaluation carried out using data gathered from a real online dating service shows the benefits of our proposed methodology with respect to traditional match-making baseline systems. Our analysis also provides deep insights into the aspects of match-making that are particularly important for producing highly relevant matches.},

We conducted experiments on decentralized IR operations on various scales of information networks and analyzed effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of various search methods. Results showed network structure, i.e., how distributed systems connect to one another, is crucial for retrieval performance. Relying on partial indexes of distributed systems, some level of network clustering enabled very efficient and effective discovery of relevant information in large scale networks. For a given network clustering level, search time was well explained by a poly-logarithmic relation to network size (i.e., the number of distributed systems), indicating a high scalability potential for searching in a growing information space. In addition, network clustering only involved local self-organization and required no global control - clustering time remained roughly constant across the various scales of networks.},

abstract = {A Web search engine must update its index periodically to incorporate changes to the Web. We argue in this paper that index updates fundamentally impact the design of search engine result caches, a performance-critical component of modern search engines. Index updates lead to the problem of cache invalidation: invalidating cached entries of queries whose results have changed. Naive approaches, such as flushing the entire cache upon every index update, lead to poor performance and in fact, render caching futile when the frequency of updates is high. Solving the invalidation problem efficiently corresponds to predicting accurately which queries will produce different results if re-evaluated, given the actual changes to the index.To obtain this property, we propose a framework for developing invalidation predictors and define metrics to evaluate invalidation schemes. We describe concrete predictors using this framework and compare them against a baseline that uses a cache invalidation scheme based on time-to-live (TTL). Evaluation over Wikipedia documents using a query log from the Yahoo! search engine shows that selective invalidation of cached search results can lower the number of unnecessary query evaluations by as much as 30% compared to a baseline scheme, while returning results of similar freshness. In general, our predictors enable fewer unnecessary invalidations and fewer stale results compared to a TTL-only scheme for similar freshness of results.},

Current resource selection algorithms such as GlOSS, CORI, ReDDE, Geometric Average and the recent classification-based method focus on the evidence of individual information sources to determine the relevance of available sources. Current algorithms do not model the important relationship information among individual sources. For example, an information source tends to be relevant to a user query if it is similar to another source with high probability of being relevant. This paper proposes a joint probabilistic classification model for resource selection. The model estimates the probability of relevance of information sources in a joint manner by considering both the evidence of individual sources and their relationship.

In this paper we focus on analyzing the sequence of user actions to model users' click behavior on sponsored listings shown on the search results page. We first show that temporal click sequences are good indicators of externalities in the advertising domain. We then describe the positional rationality hypothesis to explain both the position bias and the externalities, and based on this hypothesis we further propose the temporal click model (TCM), a Bayesian framework that is scalable and computationally efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to estimate positional bias, externalities and unbiased user-perceived ad quality from user click logs in a combined model. We finally evaluate the proposed model on two real datasets, each containing over 100 million ad impressions obtained from a commercial search engine. The experimental results show that TCM outperforms two other competitive methods at click prediction.},

abstract = {The collective contributions of billions of users across the globe each day result in an ever-changing web. In verticals like news and real-time search, recency is an obvious significant factor for ranking. However, traditional link-based web ranking algorithms typically run on a single web snapshot without concern for user activities associated with the dynamics of web pages and links. Therefore, a stale page popular many years ago may still achieve a high authority score due to its accumulated in-links. To remedy this situation, we propose a temporal web link-based ranking scheme, which incorporates features from historical author activities. We quantify web page freshness over time from page and in-link activity, and design a web surfer model that incorporates web freshness, based on a temporal web graph composed of multiple web snapshots at different time points. It includes authority propagation among snapshots, enabling link structures at distinct time points to influence each other when estimating web page authority. Experiments on a real-world archival web corpus show our approach improves upon PageRank in both relevance and freshness of the search results.},

abstract = {It is generally believed that propagated anchor text is very important for effective Web search as offered by the commercial search engines. "Google Bombs" are a notable illustration of this. However, many years of TREC Web retrieval research failed to establish the effectiveness of link evidence for ad hoc retrieval on Web collections. The ultimate resolution to this dilemma was that typical Web search is very different from the traditional ad hoc methodology. So far, however, no one has established why link information, like incoming link degree or anchor text, does not help ad hoc retrieval effectiveness. Several possible explanations were given, including the collections being too small for anchors to be effective, and the density of the link graph being too low.The new TREC 2009 Web Track collection is substantially larger than previous collections and has a dense link graph. Our main finding is that propagated anchor text outperforms full-text retrieval in terms of early precision, and in combination with it, gives an improvement in overall precision. We then analyse the impact of link density and collection size by down-sampling the number of links and the number of pages respectively.Other findings are that, contrary to expectations, (inter-server) link density has little impact on effectiveness, while the size of the collection has a substantial impact on the quantity, quality and effectiveness of anchor text. We also compare the diversity of the search results of anchor text and full-text approaches, which show that anchor text performs significantly better than full-text search and confirm our findings for the ad hoc search task.},

abstract = {An improved understanding of the relationship between search intent, result quality, and searcher behavior is crucial for improving the effectiveness of web search. While recent progress in user behavior mining has been largely focused on aggregate server-side click logs, we present a new class of search behavior models that also exploit fine-grained user interactions with the search results.We show that mining these interactions, such as mouse movements and scrolling, can enable more effective detection of the user's search goals. Potential applications include automatic search evaluation, improving search ranking, result presentation, and search advertising. We describe extensive experimental evaluation over both controlled user studies, and logs of interaction data collected from hundreds of real users. The results show that our method is more effective than the current state-of-the-art techniques, both for detection of searcher goals, and for an important practical application of predicting ad clicks for a given search session.},

abstract = {It has been shown that learning to rank approaches are capable of learning highly effective ranking functions. However, these approaches have mostly ignored the important issue of efficiency. Given that both efficiency and effectiveness are important for real search engines, models that are optimized for effectiveness may not meet the strict efficiency requirements necessary to deploy in a production environment. In this work, we present a unified framework for jointly optimizing effectiveness and efficiency. We propose new metrics that capture the tradeoff between these two competing forces and devise a strategy for automatically learning models that directly optimize the tradeoff metrics. Experiments indicate that models learned in this way provide a good balance between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. With specific loss functions, learned models converge to familiar existing ones, which demonstrates the generality of our framework. Finally, we show that our approach naturally leads to a reduction in the variance of query execution times, which is important for query load balancing and user satisfaction.},

Optimizing this action sequence, called the conversion funnel, is the ultimate goal of advertising. Advertisers, however, often have very different sub-goals for their ads such as purchase, request for a quote, or simply a site visit. Often an improvement for one advertiser's goal comes at the expense of others. A single ranking function must balance these different goals in order to make an efficient system for all advertisers. We propose a ranking method that globally balances the goals of all advertisers, while simultaneously improving overall performance. Our method has been shown to improve significantly over the baseline in online traffic at a major ad network.},

We perform experiments on a large real-world Web data collection and show that using the goodness score of flexible proximity terms can improve ranking accuracy over state-of-the-art ranking methods by as much as 13%.

abstract = {Like traditional supervised and semi-supervised algorithms, learning to rank for information retrieval requires document annotations provided by domain experts. It is costly to annotate training data for different search domains and tasks. We propose to exploit training data annotated for a related domain to learn to rank retrieved documents in the target domain, in which no labeled data is available. We present a simple yet effective approach based on instance-weighting scheme. Our method first estimates the importance of each related-domain document relative to the target domain. Then heuristics are studied to transform the importance of individual documents to the pairwise weights of document pairs, which can be directly incorporated into the popular ranking algorithms. Due to importance weighting, ranking model trained on related domain is highly adaptable to the data of target domain. Ranking adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 dataset [27] demonstrate that with a fair amount of related-domain training data, our method significantly outperforms the baseline without weighting, and most of time is not significantly worse than an "ideal" model directly trained on target domain.},

In this paper we study the feasibility of meta search results clustering, which has unique features compared to the general meta clustering problem. After showing that the combination of multiple search results clusterings is empirically justified, we cast meta clustering as an optimization problem of an objective function measuring the probabilistic concordance between the clustering combination and the single clusterings. We then show, using an easily computable upper bound on such a function, that a simple stochastic optimization algorithm delivers reasonable approximations of the optimal value very efficiently, and we also provide a method for labeling the generated clusters with the most agreed upon cluster labels. Optimal meta clustering with meta labeling is applied to three description-centric, state-of-the-art search results clustering algorithms. The performance improvement is demonstrated through a range of evaluation techniques (i.e., internal, classification-oriented, and information retrieval-oriented), using suitable test collections of search results with document-level relevance judgments per subtopic.},

abstract = {The vector space model (VSM) is a popular and widely applied model in information retrieval (IR). VSM creates vector spaces whose dimensionality is usually high (e.g., tens of thousands of terms). This may cause various problems, such as susceptibility to noise and difficulty in capturing the underlying semantic structure, which are commonly recognized as different aspects of the "curse of dimensionality." In this paper, we investigate a novel aspect of the dimensionality curse, which is referred to as hubness and manifested by the tendency of some documents (called hubs) to be included in unexpectedly many search result lists. Hubness may impact VSM considerably since hubs can become obstinate results, irrelevant to a large number of queries, thus harming the performance of an IR system and the experience of its users. We analyze the origins of hubness, showing it is primarily a consequence of high (intrinsic) dimensionality of data, and not a result of other factors such as sparsity and skewness of the distribution of term frequencies. We describe the mechanisms through which hubness emerges by exploring the behavior of similarity measures in high-dimensional vector spaces. Our consideration begins with the classical VSM (tf-idf term weighting and cosine similarity), but the conclusions generalize to more advanced variations, such as Okapi BM25. Moreover, we explain why hubness may not be easily mitigated by dimensionality reduction, and propose a similarity adjustment scheme that takes into account the existence of hubs. Experimental results over real data indicate that significant improvement can be obtained through consideration of hubness.},

Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest.},

abstract = {The Vector Space Model has been and to a great extent still is the de facto choice for profile representation in content-based Information Filtering. However, user profiles represented as weighted keyword vectors have inherent dimensionality problems. As the number of profile keywords increases, the vector representation becomes ambiguous, due to the exponential increase in the volume of the vector space and in the number of possible keyword combinations. We argue that the complexity and dynamics of Information Filtering require user profile representations which are resilient and resistant to this "curse of dimensionality". A user profile has to be able to incorporate many features and to adapt to a variety of interest changes. We propose an alternative, network-based profile representation that meets these challenging requirements. Experiments show that the network profile representation can more effectively capture additional information about a user's interests and thus achieve significant performance improvements over a vector-based representation comprising the same weighted keywords.},

However, current evaluation techniques disregard the fact that users continue to rate items over time: the temporal characteristics of the system's top-N recommendations are not investigated. In particular, there is no means of measuring the extent that the same items are being recommended to users over and over again. In this work, we show that temporal diversity is an important facet of recommender systems, by showing how CF data changes over time and performing a user survey. We then evaluate three CF algorithms from the point of view of the diversity in the sequence of recommendation lists they produce over time. We examine how a number of characteristics of user rating patterns (including profile size and time between rating) affect diversity. We then propose and evaluate set methods that maximise temporal recommendation diversity without extensively penalising accuracy.},

Following the hypothesis that the degree of user's surprise is proportional to the estimated search time, we consider both innovators' preferences and trends for identifying items with long estimated search times. To predict which items the target user is likely to purchase in the near future, the candidate items, this algorithm weights each item that innovators have purchased and that reflect one or more current trends; it then lists them in order of decreasing weight. Experiments demonstrate that this algorithm outputs recommendations that offer high user/item coverage, a low Gini coefficient, and long estimated search times, and so offers a high degree of recommendation serendipitousness.},

It is argued that the optimal ranking problem should be factorized into two distinct yet interrelated stages: the relevance prediction stage and ranking decision stage. During retrieval the relevance of documents is not known a priori, and the joint probability of relevance is used to measure the uncertainty of documents' relevance in the collection as a whole. The resulting optimization objective function in the latter stage is, thus, the expected value of the IR metric with respect to this probability measure of relevance. Through statistically analyzing the expected values of IR metrics under such uncertainty, we discover and explain some interesting properties of IR metrics that have not been known before. Our analysis and optimization framework do not assume a particular (relevance) retrieval model and metric, making it applicable to many existing IR models and metrics. The experiments on one of resulting applications have demonstrated its significance in adapting to various IR metrics.},

abstract = {Inferring the score distribution of relevant and non-relevant documents is an essential task for many IR applications (e.g. information filtering, recall-oriented IR, meta-search, distributed IR). Modeling score distributions in an accurate manner is the basis of any inference. Thus, numerous score distribution models have been proposed in the literature. Most of the models were proposed on the basis of empirical evidence and goodness-of-fit. In this work, we model score distributions in a rather different, systematic manner. We start with a basic assumption on the distribution of terms in a document. Following the transformations applied on term frequencies by two basic ranking functions, BM25 and Language Models, we derive the distribution of the produced scores for all documents. Then we focus on the relevant documents. We detach our analysis from particular ranking functions. Instead, we consider a model for precision-recall curves, and given this model, we present a general mathematical framework which, given any score distribution for all retrieved documents, produces an analytical formula for the score distribution of relevant documents that is consistent with the precision-recall curves that follow the aforementioned model. In particular, assuming a Gamma distribution for all retrieved documents, we show that the derived distribution for the relevant documents resembles a Gaussian distribution with a heavy right tail.},

abstract = {Combining multiple documents to represent an information object is well-known as an effective approach for many Information Retrieval tasks. For example, passages can be combined to represent a document for retrieval, document clusters are represented using combinations of the documents they contain, and feedback documents can be combined to represent a query model. Various techniques for combination have been introduced, and among them, representation techniques based on concatenation and the arithmetic mean are frequently used. Some recent work has shown the potential of a new representation technique using the geometric mean. However, these studies lack a theoretical foundation explaining why the geometric mean should have advantages for representing multiple documents. In this paper, we show that the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are approximations to the center of mass in certain geometries, and show empirically that the geometric mean is closer to the center. Through experiments with two IR tasks, we show the potential benefits for geometric representations, including a geometry-based pseudo-relevance feedback method that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.},

To address the uncertainty in inferring the information need, we estimate utility by the expected similarity between the given ranking and those induced by relevance models; the impact of a relevance model is based on its presumed representativeness of the information need. Specific query-performance predictors instantiated from the framework substantially outperform state-of-the-art predictors over five TREC corpora.},

abstract = {Learning to rank arises in many information retrieval applications, ranging from Web search engine, online advertising to recommendation system. In learning to rank, the performance of a ranking model is strongly affected by the number of labeled examples in the training set; on the other hand, obtaining labeled examples for training data is very expensive and time-consuming. This presents a great need for the active learning approaches to select most informative examples for ranking learning; however, in the literature there is still very limited work to address active learning for ranking. In this paper, we propose a general active learning framework, Expected Loss Optimization (ELO), for ranking. The ELO framework is applicable to a wide range of ranking functions. Under this framework, we derive a novel algorithm, Expected DCG Loss Optimization (ELO-DCG), to select most informative examples. Furthermore, we investigate both query and document level active learning for raking and propose a two-stage ELO-DCG algorithm which incorporate both query and document selection into active learning. Extensive experiments on real-world Web search data sets have demonstrated great potential and effective-ness of the proposed framework and algorithms.},

We focus on verbose queries that have sentence-like structure, but are not simple "wh-" questions, and assume the search engine is a "black box." We evaluated the output of two search engines using queries from a CQA service and our results show that, among a broad range of techniques, the most effective approach is to simply reduce the length of the query. This can be achieved effectively by removing "stop structure" instead of only stop words. We show that the process of learning and removing stop structure from a query can be effectively automated.},

abstract = {Automatic Document Classification (ADC) is still one of the major information retrieval problems. It usually employs a supervised learning strategy, where we first build a classification model using pre-classified documents and then use this model to classify unseen documents. The majority of supervised algorithms consider that all documents provide equally important information. However, in practice, a document may be considered more or less important to build the classification model according to several factors, such as its timeliness, the venue where it was published in, its authors, among others. In this paper, we are particularly concerned with the impact that temporal effects may have on ADC and how to minimize such impact. In order to deal with these effects, we introduce a temporal weighting function (TWF) and propose a methodology to determine it for document collections. We applied the proposed methodology to ACM-DL and Medline and found that the TWF of both follows a lognormal. We then extend three ADC algorithms (namely kNN, Rocchio and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes) to incorporate the TWF. Experiments showed that the temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains, outperforming (or at least matching) state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Current MLC methods have been focused on learning-to-map from instances to ranked lists of categories in a relatively high-dimensional space. The fine-grained features in such a space may not be sufficiently expressive for characterizing discriminative patterns, and worse, make the model complexity unnecessarily high. This paper proposes an alternative approach by transforming conventional representations of instances and categories into a relatively small set of link-based meta-level features, and leveraging successful learning-to-rank retrieval algorithms (e.g., SVM-MAP) over this reduced feature space. Controlled experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show strong empirical evidence for the strength of the proposed approach, as it significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art methods, including Rank-SVM, ML-kNN and IBLR-ML (Instance-based Logistic Regression for Multi-label Classification) in most cases.},

abstract = {As a principled approach to capturing semantic relations of words in information retrieval, statistical translation models have been shown to outperform simple document language models which rely on exact matching of words in the query and documents. A main challenge in applying translation models to ad hoc information retrieval is to estimate a translation model without training data. Existing work has relied on training on synthetic queries generated based on a document collection. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not have a good coverage of query words. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to estimate a translation model based on normalized mutual information between words, which is less computationally expensive and has better coverage of query words than the synthetic query method of estimation. We also propose to regularize estimated translation probabilities to ensure sufficient probability mass for self-translation. Experiment results show that the proposed mutual information-based estimation method is not only more efficient, but also more effective than the synthetic query-based method, and it can be combined with pseudo-relevance feedback to further improve retrieval accuracy. The results also show that the proposed regularization strategy is effective and can improve retrieval accuracy for both synthetic query-based estimation and mutual information-based estimation.},

Firstly, we present a probabilistic model which effectively ranks the possible interpretations of a keyword query over structured data. Then, we introduce a scheme to diversify the search results by re-ranking query interpretations, taking into account redundancy of query results. Finally, we propose α-nDCG-W and WS-recall, an adaptation of α-nDCG and S-recall metrics, taking into account graded relevance of subtopics. Our evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that search results obtained using the proposed diversification algorithms better characterize possible answers available in the database than the results of the initial relevance ranking.},

abstract = {Data Fusion is the combination of a number of independent search results, relating to the same document collection, into a single result to be presented to the user. A number of probabilistic data fusion models have been shown to be effective in empirical studies. These typically attempt to estimate the probability that particular documents will be relevant, based on training data. However, little attempt has been made to gauge how the accuracy of these estimations affect fusion performance. The focus of this paper is twofold: firstly, that accurate estimation of the probability of relevance results in effective data fusion; and secondly, that an effective approximation of this probability can be made based on less training data that has previously been employed. This is based on the observation that the distribution of relevant documents follows a similar pattern in most high-quality result sets. Curve fitting suggests that this can be modelled by a simple function that is less complex than other models that have been proposed. The use of existing IR evaluation metrics is proposed as a substitution for probability calculations. Mean Average Precision is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with evaluation results demonstrating competitive performance when compared with related algorithms with more onerous requirements for training data.},

Some break-throughs have been made: two newly proposed click models, DBN and CCM, addressed this problem and improved document relevance estimation. However, to further improve the estimation, we need a model that can capture more sophisticated user behaviors. In particular, after clicking a search result, a user's behavior (such as the dwell time on the clicked document, and whether there are further clicks on the clicked document) can be highly indicative of the relevance of the document. Unfortunately, such measures have not been incorporated in previous click models. In this paper, we introduce a novel click model, called the post-click click model (PCC), which provides an unbiased estimation of document relevance through leveraging both click behaviors on the search page and post-click behaviors beyond the search page. The PCC model is based on the Bayesian approach, and because of its incremental nature, it is highly scalable to large scale and constantly growing log data. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state of the art methods merely relying on click logs.},

Evaluated based on user feedback collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk, our experimental results show that the Boolean filtering approach, which is widely used in faceted search in e-commerce, doesn't work well for text document retrieval, due to the incompleteness (low recall) of metadata assignment in semi-structured text documents. Instead, a soft model performs more effectively. The faceted feedback mechanism can also be combined with document-based relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback to further improve the retrieval performance.},

abstract = {Information retrieval systems face a number of challenges, originating mainly from the semantic gap problem. Implicit feedback techniques have been employed in the past to address many of these issues. Although this was a step towards the right direction, a need to personalise and tailor the search experience to the user-specific needs has become evident. In this study we examine ways of personalising affective models trained on facial expression data. Using personalised data we adapt these models to individual users and compare their performance to a general model. The main goal is to determine whether the behavioural differences of users have an impact on the models' ability to determine topical relevance and if, by personalising them, we can improve their accuracy. For modelling relevance we extract a set of features from the facial expression data and classify them using Support Vector Machines. Our initial evaluation indicates that accounting for individual differences and applying personalisation introduces, in most cases, a noticeable improvement in the models' performance.},

abstract = {Dwell time on Web pages has been extensively used for various information retrieval tasks. However, some basic yet important questions have not been sufficiently addressed, eg, what distribution is appropriate to model the distribution of dwell times on a Web page, and furthermore, what the distribution tells us about the underlying browsing behaviors. In this paper, we draw an analogy between abandoning a page during Web browsing and a system failure in reliability analysis, and propose to model the dwell time using the Weibull distribution. Using this distribution provides better goodness-of-fit to real world data, and it uncovers some interesting patterns of user browsing behaviors not previously reported. For example, our analysis reveals that Web browsing in general exhibits a significant "negative aging" phenomenon, which means that some initial screening has to be passed before a page is examined in detail, giving rise to the browsing behavior that we call "screen-and-glean." In addition, we demonstrate that dwell time distributions can be reasonably predicted purely based on low-level page features, which broadens the possible applications of this study to situations where log data may be unavailable.},

abstract = {Existing question retrieval models work relatively well in finding similar questions in community-based question answering (cQA) services. However, they are designed for single-sentence queries or bag-of-word representations, and are not sufficient to handle multi-sentence questions complemented with various contexts. Segmenting questions into parts that are topically related could assist the retrieval system to not only better understand the user's different information needs but also fetch the most appropriate fragments of questions and answers in cQA archive that are relevant to user's query. In this paper, we propose a graph based approach to segmenting multi-sentence questions. The results from user studies show that our segmentation model outperforms traditional systems in question segmentation by over 30% in user's satisfaction. We incorporate the segmentation model into existing cQA question retrieval framework for more targeted question matching, and the empirical evaluation results demonstrate that the segmentation boosts the question retrieval performance by up to 12.93% in Mean Average Precision and 11.72% in Top One Precision. Our model comes with a comprehensive question detector equipped with both lexical and syntactic features.},

This raises a interesting research question on whether the blogosphere can be used to identify important news stories.

The proposed system consists of two components based on the language model framework, the query likelihood and the news headline prior. For the query likelihood, we propose several approaches to estimate the query language model and the news headline language model. We also suggest several criteria to evaluate the news headline prior that is the prior belief about the importance or newsworthiness of the news headline for a given day. Experimental results show that our system significantly outperforms a baseline system. Specifically, the proposed approach gives 2.62% and 10.19% further increases in MAP and P@5 over the best performing result of the TREC'09 Top Stories Identification Task.},

In this paper we propose a simple probabilistic model for assigning relevant opinion scores to documents. The key problem is how to capture opinion expressions in the document, that are related to the query topic. Current solutions enrich general opinion lexicons by finding query-specific opinion lexicons using pseudo-relevance feedback on external corpora or the collection itself. In this paper we use a general opinion lexicon and propose using proximity information in order to capture opinion term relatedness to the query. We propose a proximity-based opinion propagation method to calculate the opinion density at each point in a document. The opinion density at the position of a query term in the document can then be considered as the probability of opinion about the query term at that position. The effect of different kernels for capturing the proximity is also discussed. Experimental results on the BLOG06 dataset show that the proposed method provides significant improvement over standard TREC baselines and achieves a 2.5% increase in MAP over the best performing run in the TREC 2008 blog track.},

abstract = {Question answering (QA) helps one go beyond traditional keywords-based querying and retrieve information in more precise form than given by a document or a list of documents. Several community-based QA (CQA) services have emerged allowing information seekers pose their information need as questions and receive answers from their fellow users. A question may receive multiple answers from multiple users and the asker or the community can choose the best answer. While the asker can thus indicate if he was satisfied with the information he received, there is no clear way of evaluating the quality of that information. We present a study to evaluate and predict the quality of an answer in a CQA setting. We chose Yahoo! Answers as such CQA service and selected a small set of questions, each with at least five answers. We asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to rate the quality of each answer for a given question based on 13 different criteria. Each answer was rated by five different workers. We then matched their assessments with the actual asker's rating of a given answer. We show that the quality criteria we used faithfully match with asker's perception of a quality answer. We furthered our investigation by extracting various features from questions, answers, and the users who posted them, and training a number of classifiers to select the best answer using those features. We demonstrate a high predictability of our trained models along with the relative merits of each of the features for such prediction. These models support our argument that in case of CQA, contextual information such as a user's profile, can be critical in evaluating and predicting content quality.},

Near-duplicate documents can be reliably detected through this improved similarity measure. In addition, these vectors can be mapped to a small number of hash-values as document signatures through the locality sensitive hashing scheme for efficient similarity computation. We demonstrate our approach in two target domains: Web news articles and email messages. Our method is not only more accurate than the commonly used methods such as Shingles and I-Match, but also shows consistent improvement across the domains, which is a desired property lacked by existing methods.},

We design experiments with two publicly available TREC web corpora (GOV2 and ClueWeb09) to evaluate different approaches for discovering missing anchor text. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively discover plausible missing anchor terms. We then use the web named page finding task in the TREC Terabyte track to explore the utility of missing anchor text information discovered by our approach for helping retrieval. Experimental results show that our approach can statistically significantly improve retrieval performance, compared with several approaches that only use anchor text aggregated over the web graph.},

This community value and related services like search and advertising are threatened by spammers, content polluters, and malware disseminators. In an effort to preserve community value and ensure longterm success, we propose and evaluate a honeypot-based approach for uncovering social spammers in online social systems. Two of the key components of the proposed approach are: (1) The deployment of social honeypots for harvesting deceptive spam profiles from social networking communities; and (2) Statistical analysis of the properties of these spam profiles for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers. We describe the conceptual framework and design considerations of the proposed approach, and we present concrete observations from the deployment of social honeypots in MySpace and Twitter. We find that the deployed social honeypots identify social spammers with low false positive rates and that the harvested spam data contains signals that are strongly correlated with observable profile features (e.g., content, friend information, posting patterns, etc.). Based on these profile features, we develop machine learning based classifiers for identifying previously unknown spammers with high precision and a low rate of false positives.},

Rather than using trails solely to improve ranking, it may also be worth providing trail information directly to users. In this paper, we quantify the benefit that users currently obtain from trail-following and compare different methods for finding the best trail for a given query and each top-ranked result. We compare the relevance, topic coverage, topic diversity, and utility of trails selected using different methods, and break out findings by factors such as query type and origin relevance. Our findings demonstrate value in trails, highlight interesting differences in the performance of trailfinding algorithms, and show we can find best-trails for a query that outperform the trails most users follow.

Previous studies on context-aware search were either focused on the development of context models or limited to a relatively small scale investigation under a controlled laboratory setting. Particularly, about context-aware ranking for Web search, the following two critical problems are largely remained unsolved. First, how can we take advantage of different types of contexts in ranking? Second, how can we integrate context information into a ranking model? In this paper, we tackle the above two essential problems analytically and empirically. We develop different ranking principles for different types of contexts. Moreover, we adopt a learning-to-rank approach and integrate the ranking principles into a state-of-the-art ranking model by encoding the context information as features of the model. We empirically test our approach using a large search log data set obtained from a major commercial search engine. Our evaluation uses both human judgments and implicit user click data. The experimental results clearly show that our context-aware ranking approach improves the ranking of a commercial search engine which ignores context information. Furthermore, our method outperforms a baseline method which considers context information in ranking.},

Our specific focus is performance improvements obtained by using overlapping relevance labels, which is by collecting multiple human judgments for each training sample. The paper explores whether, when, and for which samples one should obtain overlapping training labels, as well as how many labels per sample are needed. The proposed selective labeling scheme collects additional labels only for a subset of training samples, specifically for those that are labeled relevant by a judge. Our experiments show that this labeling scheme improves the NDCG of two Web search rankers on several real-world test sets, with a low labeling overhead of around 1.4 labels per sample. This labeling scheme also outperforms several methods of using overlapping labels, such as simple k-overlap, majority vote, the highest labels, etc. Finally, the paper presents a study of how many overlapping labels are needed to get the best improvement in retrieval accuracy.},

abstract = {Web documents are typically associated with many text streams, including the body, the title and the URL that are determined by the authors, and the anchor text or search queries used by others to refer to the documents. Through a systematic large scale analysis on their cross entropy, we show that these text streams appear to be composed in different language styles, and hence warrant respective language models to properly describe their properties. We propose a language modeling approach to Web document retrieval in which each document is characterized by a mixture model with components corresponding to the various text streams associated with the document. Immediate issues for such a mixture model arise as all the text streams are not always present for the documents, and they do not share the same lexicon, making it challenging to properly combine the statistics from the mixture components. To address these issues, we introduce an 'open-vocabulary' smoothing technique so that all the component language models have the same cardinality and their scores can simply be linearly combined. To ensure that the approach can cope with Web scale applications, the model training algorithm is designed to require no labeled data and can be fully automated with few heuristics and no empirical parameter tunings. The evaluation on Web document ranking tasks shows that the component language models indeed have varying degrees of capabilities as predicted by the cross-entropy analysis, and the combined mixture model outperforms the state-of-the-art BM25F based system.},

We address this problem in the framework of multiview learning, where different languages correspond to different views of the same document, combined with semi-supervised learning in order to benefit from unlabeled documents. We rely on two techniques, coregularization and consensus-based self-training, that combine multiview and semi-supervised learning in different ways. Our approach trains different monolingual classifiers on each of the views, such that the classifiers' decisions over a set of unlabeled examples are in agreement as much as possible, and iteratively labels new examples from another unlabeled training set based on a consensus across language-specific classifiers. We derive a boosting-based training algorithm for this task, and analyze the impact of the number of views on the semi-supervised learning results on a multilingual extension of the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 corpus using five different languages. Our experiments show that coregularization and consensus-based self-training are complementary and that their combination is especially effective in the interesting and very common situation where there are few views (languages) and few labeled documents available.},

abstract = {Although it is common practice to produce only a single clustering of a dataset, in many cases text documents can be clustered along different dimensions. Unfortunately, not only do traditional text clustering algorithms fail to produce multiple clusterings of a dataset, the only clustering they produce may not be the one that the user desires. In this paper, we propose a simple active clustering algorithm that is capable of producing multiple clusterings of the same data according to user interest. In comparison to previous work on feedback-oriented clustering, the amount of user feedback required by our algorithm is minimal. In fact, the feedback turns out to be as simple as a cursory look at a list of words. Experimental results are very promising: our system is able to generate clusterings along the user-specified dimensions with reasonable accuracies on several challenging text classification tasks, thus providing suggestive evidence that our approach is viable.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate a novel and important problem in multi-document summarization, i.e., how to extract an easy-to-understand English summary for non-native readers. Existing summarization systems extract the same kind of English summaries from English news documents for both native and non-native readers. However, the non-native readers have different English reading skills because they have different English education and learning backgrounds. An English summary which can be easily understood by native readers may be hardly understood by non-native readers. We propose to add the dimension of reading easiness or difficulty to multi-document summarization, and the proposed EUSUM system can produce easy-to-understand summaries according to the English reading skills of the readers. The sentence-level reading easiness (or difficulty) is predicted by using the SVM regression method. And the reading easiness score of each sentence is then incorporated into the summarization process. Empirical evaluation and user study have been performed and the results demonstrate that the EUSUM system can produce more easy-to-understand summaries for non-native readers than existing summarization systems, with very little sacrifice of the summary's informativeness.},

In this paper, we perform a careful study on the recently proposed visual summarization approaches, including the thumbnail of the web page snapshot, the internal image in the web page which is representative of the content in the page, and the visual snippet which is a synthesized image based on the internal image, the title, and the logo found in the web page. Moreover, since the internal image based summarization approach hardly works when the representative internal images are unavailable, we propose a new strategy, which retrieves the representative image from the external to summarize the web page. The experimental results suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective advantages on different types of web pages. While internal images and thumbnails can provide a reliable summarization on web pages with dominant images and web pages with simple structure respectively, the external images are regarded as a useful information to complement the internal images and are demonstrated very useful in helping users understanding new web pages . The visual snippet performs well on the re-finding tasks since it incorporates the title and logo which are advantageous on identifying the visited web pages.},

Designed as a blind and unbiased test for eliciting a preference between two retrieval functions, an interleaved ranking of the results of two retrieval functions is presented to the users. It is then observed whether the users click more on results from one retrieval function or the other. While it was shown that such interleaving experiments reliably identify the better of the two retrieval functions, the naive approach of counting all clicks equally leads to a suboptimal test. We present new methods for learning how to score different types of clicks so that the resulting test statistic optimizes the statistical power of the experiment. This can lead to substantial savings in the amount of data required for reaching a target confidence level. Our methods are evaluated on an operational search engine over a collection of scientific articles.},

Our approach relies on the concept of the query-flow graph. The query-flow graph aggregates query reformulations from many users: nodes in the graph represent queries, and two queries are connected if they are likely to appear as part of the same search goal. Our query similarity measure is obtained by projecting the graph (or appropriate subgraphs of it) on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Our experiments show that the measure we obtain captures a notion of semantic similarity between queries and it is useful for diversifying query recommendations.},

abstract = {How does the web search behavior of "rich" and "poor" people differ? Do men and women tend to click on difffferent results for the same query? What are some queries almost exclusively issued by African Americans? These are some of the questions we address in this study.Our research combines three data sources: the query log of a major US-based web search engine, profile information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year, gender and ZIP code), and US-census information including detailed demographic information aggregated at the level of ZIP code. Through this combination we can annotate each query with, e.g. the average per-capita income in the ZIP code it originated from. Though conceptually simple, this combination immediately creates a powerful user modeling tool.The main contributions of this work are the following. First, we provide a demographic description of a large sample of search engine users in the US and show that it agrees well with the distribution of the US population. Second, we describe how different segments of the population differ in their search behavior, e.g. with respect to the queries they formulate or the URLs they click. Third, we explore applications of our methodology to improve web search relevance and to provide better query suggestions.These results enable a wide range of applications including improving web search and advertising where, for instance, targeted advertisements for "family vacations" could be adapted to the (expected) income.},

This allows us to propose a more realistic version of AP where users click non-deterministically on relevant documents and where the number of relevant documents in the collection needs not be known in advance. We then depart from the assumption that a document is either relevant or irrelevant and we use instead relevance judgment similar to editorial labels used for Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG). We assume that clicked documents provide users with a certain level of "utility" and that a user ends a search when she gathered enough utility. Based on the query logs of a commercial search engine we show how to evaluate the utility associated with a label from the record of past user interactions with the search engine and we show how the two different user models can be evaluated based on their ability to predict accurately future clicks. Finally, based on these user models, we propose a measure that captures the relative quality of two rankings.},

abstract = {Portable, reusable test collections are a vital part of research and development in information retrieval. Reusability is difficult to assess, however. The standard approach--simulating judgment collection when groups of systems are held out, then evaluating those held-out systems--only works when there is a large set of relevance judgments to draw on during the simulation. As test collections adapt to larger and larger corpora, it becomes less and less likely that there will be sufficient judgments for such simulation experiments. Thus we propose a methodology for information retrieval experimentation that collects evidence for or against the reusability of a test collection while judgments are being made. Using this methodology along with the appropriate statistical analyses, researchers will be able to estimate the reusability of their test collections while building them and implement "course corrections" if the collection does not seem to be achieving desired levels of reusability. We show the robustness of our design to inherent sources of variance, and provide a description of an actual implementation of the framework for creating a large test collection.},

The nDCG measure is found to correlate best with user preferences compared to a selection of other well known measures. Unlike previous studies in this area, this examination involved a large population of users, gathered through crowd sourcing, exposed to a wide range of retrieval systems, test collections and search tasks. Reasons for user preferences were also gathered and analyzed.

abstract = {Sponsored search is one of the major sources of revenue for search engines on the World Wide Web. It has been observed that while showing ads for every query maximizes short-term revenue, irrelevant ads lead to poor user experience and less revenue in the long-term. Hence, it is in search engines' interest to place ads only for queries that are likely to attract ad-clicks. Many algorithms for estimating query advertisability exist in literature, but most of these methods have been proposed for and tested on the frequent or "head" queries. Since query frequencies on search engine are known to be distributed as a power-law, this leaves a huge fraction of the queries uncovered.In this paper we focus on the more challenging problem of estimating query advertisability for infrequent or "tail" queries. These require fundamentally different methods than head queries: for e.g., tail queries are almost all unique and require the estimation method to be online and inexpensive. We show that previously proposed methods do not apply to tail queries, and when modified for our scenario they do not work well. Further, we give a simple, yet effective, approach, which estimates query advertisability using only the words present in the queries. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset consisting of search engine queries and user clicks. Our results show that our simple approach outperforms a more complex one based on regularized regression.},

abstract = {Long queries form a difficult, but increasingly important segment for web search engines. Query reduction, a technique for dropping unnecessary query terms from long queries, improves performance of ad-hoc retrieval on TREC collections. Also, it has great potential for improving long web queries (upto 25% improvement in NDCG@5). However, query reduction on the web is hampered by the lack of accurate query performance predictors and the constraints imposed by search engine architectures and ranking algorithms.In this paper, we present query reduction techniques for long web queries that leverage effective and efficient query performance predictors. We propose three learning formulations that combine these predictors to perform automatic query reduction. These formulations enable trading of average improvements for the number of queries impacted, and enable easy integration into the search engine's architecture for rank-time query reduction. Experiments on a large collection of long queries issued to a commercial search engine show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform baselines, with more than 12% improvement in NDCG@5 in the impacted set of queries. Extension to the formulations such as result interleaving further improves results. We find that the proposed techniques deliver consistent retrieval gains where it matters most: poorly performing long web queries.},

Traditional feedback algorithms use a whole feedback document as a unit to extract words for query expansion, which is not optimal as a document may cover several different topics and thus contain much irrelevant information. In this paper, we study how to effectively select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of terms in feedback documents. We propose a positional relevance model (PRM) to address this problem in a unified probabilistic way. The proposed PRM is an extension of the relevance model to exploit term positions and proximity so as to assign more weights to words closer to query words based on the intuition that words closer to query words are more likely to be related to the query topic. We develop two methods to estimate PRM based on different sampling processes. Experiment results on two large retrieval datasets show that the proposed PRM is effective and robust for pseudo-relevance feedback, significantly outperforming the relevance model in both document-based feedback and passage-based feedback.},

Implicit endorsements from many trails can be useful for search result ranking, where the presence of a page on a trail increases its query relevance. Follow-ing a search trail requires user effort, yet little is known about the benefit that users obtain from this activity versus, say, sticking with the clicked search result or jumping directly to the destination page at the end of the trail. In this paper, we present a log-based study estimating the user value of trail following. We compare the relevance, topic coverage, topic diversity, novelty, and utility of full trails over that provided by sub-trails, trail origins (landing pages), and trail destinations (pages where trails end). Our findings demonstrate significant value to users in following trails, especially for certain query types. The findings have implications for the design of search systems, including trail recommendation systems that display trails on search result pages.},

abstract = {Several studies have found that the Cranfield approach to evaluation can report significant performance differences between retrieval systems for which little to no performance difference is found for humans completing tasks with these systems. We revisit the relationship between precision and performance by measuring human performance on tightly controlled search tasks and with user interfaces offering limited interaction. We find that human performance and retrieval precision are strongly related. We also find that users change their relevance judging behavior based on the precision of the results. This change in behavior coupled with the well-known lack of perfect inter-assessor agreement can reduce the measured performance gains predicted by increased precision.},

abstract = {Evaluation metrics play a critical role both in the context of comparative evaluation of the performance of retrieval systems and in the context of learning-to-rank (LTR) as objective functions to be optimized. Many different evaluation metrics have been proposed in the IR literature, with average precision (AP) being the dominant one due a number of desirable properties it possesses. However, most of these measures, including average precision, do not incorporate graded relevance.In this work, we propose a new measure of retrieval effectiveness, the Graded Average Precision (GAP). GAP generalizes average precision to the case of multi-graded relevance and inherits all the desirable characteristics of AP: it has a nice probabilistic interpretation, it approximates the area under a graded precision-recall curve and it can be justified in terms of a simple but moderately plausible user model. We then evaluate GAP in terms of its informativeness and discriminative power. Finally, we show that GAP can reliably be used as an objective metric in learning to rank by illustrating that optimizing for GAP using SoftRank and LambdaRank leads to better performing ranking functions than the ones constructed by algorithms tuned to optimize for AP or NDCG even when using AP or NDCG as the test metrics.},

abstract = {Information retrieval (IR) evaluation scores are generally designed to measure the effectiveness with which relevant documents are identified and retrieved. Many scores have been proposed for this purpose over the years. These have primarily focused on aspects of precision and recall, and while these are often discussed with equal importance, in practice most attention has been given to precision focused metrics. Even for recall-oriented IR tasks of growing importance, such as patent retrieval, these precision based scores remain the primary evaluation measures. Our study examines different evaluation measures for a recall-oriented patent retrieval task and demonstrates the limitations of the current scores in comparing different IR systems for this task. We introduce PRES, a novel evaluation metric for this type of application taking account of recall and the user's search effort. The behaviour of PRES is demonstrated on 48 runs from the CLEF-IP 2009 patent retrieval track. A full analysis of the performance of PRES shows its suitability for measuring the retrieval effectiveness of systems from a recall focused perspective taking into account the user's expected search effort.},

Previous work shows that, in addition to text features, content features of videos are also useful for Web video classification. Unfortunately, extracting content features is computationally prohibitive for real-time video classification. In this paper we propose a novel video classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text features for video classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content features at classification time. The main idea of our approach is to utilize the content features extracted from training data to enrich the text based semantic kernels, yielding content-enriched semantic kernels. The content-enriched semantic kernels enable to utilize both content and text features for classifying new videos without extracting their content features. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art video classification methods.},

abstract = {Audio identification via fingerprint has been an active research field with wide applications for years. Many technical papers were published and commercial software systems were also employed. However, most of these previously reported methods work on the raw audio format in spite of the fact that nowadays compressed format audio, especially MP3 music, has grown into the dominant way to store on personal computers and transmit on the Internet. It would be interesting if a compressed unknown audio fragment is able to be directly recognized from the database without the fussy and time-consuming decompression-identification-recompression procedure. So far, very few algorithms run directly in the compressed domain for music information retrieval, and most of them take advantage of MDCT coefficients or derived energy type of features. As a first attempt, we propose in this paper utilizing compressed-domain spectral entropy as the audio feature to implement a novel audio fingerprinting algorithm. The compressed songs stored in a music database and the possibly distorted compressed query excerpts are first partially decompressed to obtain the MDCT coefficients as the intermediate result. Then by grouping granules into longer blocks, remapping the MDCT coefficients into 192 new frequency lines to unify the frequency distribution of long and short windows, and defining 9 new subbands which cover the main frequency bandwidth of popular songs in accordance with the scale-factor bands of short windows, we calculate the spectral entropy of all consecutive blocks and come to the final fingerprint sequence by means of magnitude relationship modeling. Experiments show that such fingerprints exhibit strong robustness against various audio signal distortions like recompression, noise interference, echo addition, equalization, band-pass filtering, pitch shifting, and slight time-scale modification etc. For 5s-long query examples which might be severely degraded, an average top-five retrieval precision rate of more than 90% can be obtained in our test data set composed of 1822 popular songs.},

abstract = {Music information retrieval (MIR) holds great promise as a technology for managing large music archives. One of the key components of MIR that has been actively researched into is music tagging. While significant progress has been achieved, most of the existing systems still adopt a simple classification approach, and apply machine learning classifiers directly on low level acoustic features. Consequently, they suffer the shortcomings of (1) poor accuracy, (2) lack of comprehensive evaluation results and the associated analysis based on large scale datasets, and (3) incomplete content representation, arising from the lack of multimodal and temporal information integration.In this paper, we introduce a novel system called MMTagger that effectively integrates both multimodal and temporal information in the representation of music signal. The carefully designed multilayer architecture of the proposed classification framework seamlessly combines Multiple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) into a single framework. The structure preserves more discriminative information, leading to more accurate and robust tagging. Experiment results obtained with two large music collections highlight the various advantages of our multilayer framework over state of the art techniques.},

abstract = {Content-Based Multimedia Information Retrieval (CBMIR) systems which leverage multiple retrieval experts (En) often employ a weighting scheme when combining expert results through data fusion. Typically however a query will comprise multiple query images (Im) leading to potentially N \texttimes{} M weights to be assigned. Because of the large number of potential weights, existing approaches impose a hierarchy for data fusion, such as uniformly combining query image results from a single retrieval expert into a single list and then weighting the results of each expert. In this paper we will demonstrate that this approach is sub-optimal and leads to the poor state of CBMIR performance in benchmarking evaluations. We utilize an optimization method known as Coordinate Ascent to discover the optimal set of weights (|En| ⋅ |Im|) which demonstrates a dramatic difference between known results and the theoretical maximum. We find that imposing common combinatorial hierarchies for data fusion will half the optimal performance that can be achieved. By examining the optimal weight sets at the topic level, we observe that approximately 15% of the weights (from set |En| ⋅ |Im|) for any given query, are assigned 70%-82% of the total weight mass for that topic. Furthermore we discover that the ideal distribution of weights follows a log-normal distribution. We find that we can achieve up to 88% of the performance of fully optimized query using just these 15% of the weights. Our investigation was conducted on TRECVID evaluations 2003 to 2007 inclusive and ImageCLEFPhoto 2007, totalling 181 search topics optimized over a combined collection size of 661,213 images and 1,594 topic images.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the necessity of translating query terms, which might differ from one term to another. Some untranslated terms cause irreparable performance drop while others do not. We propose an approach to estimate the translation probability of a query term, which helps decide if it should be translated or not. The approach learns regression and classification models based on a rich set of linguistic and statistical properties of the term. Experiments on NTCIR-4 and NTCIR-5 English-Chinese CLIR tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve CLIR performance. An in-depth analysis is also provided for discussing the impact of untranslated out-of-vocabulary (OOV) query terms and translation quality of non-OOV query terms on CLIR performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach to Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) called Multilingual PRF (MultiPRF). The key idea is to harness multilinguality. Given a query in a language, we take the help of another language to ameliorate the well known problems of PRF, viz. (a) The expansion terms from PRF are primarily based on co-occurrence relationships with query terms, and thus other terms which are lexically and semantically related, such as morphological variants and synonyms, are not explicitly captured, and (b) PRF is quite sensitive to the quality of the initially retrieved top k documents and is thus not robust. In MultiPRF, given a query in language L1, it is translated into language L2 and PRF is performed on a collection in language L2 and the resultant feedback model is translated from L2 back into L1. The final feedback model is obtained by combining the translated model with the original feedback model of the query in L1.Experiments were performed on standard CLEF collections in languages with widely differing characteristics, viz., French, German, Finnish and Hungarian with English as the assisting language. We observe that MultiPRF outperforms PRF and is more robust with consistent and significant improvements in the above widely differing languages. A thorough analysis of the results reveal that the second language helps in obtaining both co-occurrence based conceptual terms as well as lexically and semantically related terms. Additionally, the use of the second language collection reduces the sensitivity to performance of initial retrieval, thereby making it more robust.},

Recent research has suggested an alternative, evaluating information retrieval systems based on user behavior. Particularly promising are experiments that interleave two rankings and track user clicks. According to a recent study, interleaving experiments can identify large differences in retrieval effectiveness with much better reliability than other click-based methods.We study interleaving in more detail, comparing it with traditional measures in terms of reliability, sensitivity and agreement. To detect very small differences in retrieval effectiveness, a reliable outcome with standard metrics requires about 5,000 judged queries, and this is about as reliable as interleaving with 50,000 user impressions. Amongst the traditional measures, NDCG has the strongest correlation with interleaving. Finally, we present some new forms of analysis, including an approach to enhance interleaving sensitivity.},

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to realize the partial-duplicate detection task. Besides the similarities between documents, our proposed algorithm can simultaneously locate the duplicated parts. The main idea is to divide the partial-duplicate detection task into two subtasks: sentence level near-duplicate detection and sequence matching. For evaluation, we compare the proposed method with other approaches on both English and Chinese web collections. Experimental results appear to support that our proposed method is effectively and efficiently to detect both partial-duplicates on large web collections.},

abstract = {Vertical aggregation is the task of incorporating results from specialized search engines or verticals (e.g., images, video, news) into Web search results. Vertical selection is the subtask of deciding, given a query, which verticals, if any, are relevant. State of the art approaches use machine learned models to predict which verticals are relevant to a query. When trained using a large set of labeled data, a machine learned vertical selection model outperforms baselines which require no training data. Unfortunately, whenever a new vertical is introduced, a costly new set of editorial data must be gathered. In this paper, we propose methods for reusing training data from a set of existing (source) verticals to learn a predictive model for a new (target) vertical. We study methods for learning robust, portable, and adaptive cross-vertical models. Experiments show the need to focus on different types of features when maximizing portability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions across multiple verticals) than when maximizing adaptability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions for a specific vertical). We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through extensive experimentation for 11 verticals},

abstract = {their patients' records from paper to computer, enormous amounts of electronic medical records (EMR) have become available for medical research. Some of the EMR data are well-structured, for which traditional database management systems can provide effective retrieval and management functions. However, most of the EMR data (such as progress notes and consultation letters) are in free text formats. How to effectively and efficiently retrieve and discover useful information from the vast amount of such semi-structured data is a challenge faced by medical professionals. Without proper tools, the rich information and knowledge buried in the medical health records are unavailable for clinical research and decision-making. The objective of our research is to develop text analytics tools that are capable of parsing clinical medical data so that predefined search subjects that correspond to a list of medical diagnoses can be extracted. In addition to this particular core functionality, it is also desired that several important assets should be present within the text-analytics tools in order to improve its overall ability to be used as recommendation tools. In this research, we work with research scientists at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) in Toronto and examine a number of techniques for structuring and processing free text documents in order to effectively and efficiently search and analyze vast amount of medical records. We implement several powerful medical text analytics tools for clinical data searching and classification. For data classification, our tools sort through a great amount of patientrecords to identify the likelihood of a patient having myocardial infarction (MI) or hypertension (HTN), and classify the patients accordingly. Our tools can also identify the likelihood of a patient being a smoker, previous smoker or non-smoker based on the text data of medical records.},

Second, we show that P-Rank (SimRank is only the special case of P-Rank) has a unique solution of eeT when decay factor c is equal to 1. We also show that SimFusion algorithm is a special case of P-Rank algorithm and prove that the similarity matrix of SimFusion is the product of PageRank vector. Our experiments on the web datasets show that for P-Rank the decay factor c doesn't seriously affect the similarity accuracy and accuracy of P-Rank is also higher than SimFusion and SimRank.},

In this extend abstract, we propose to rank users according to their probability of interest in an advertisement in a learning to rank framework. We propose to extract three types of features between user behaviors such as search queries, ad click history etc and the ad content provided by advertisers. Through this way, a long-tail advertiser can select a certain number of top ranked users as needed from the user segments for ads delivery. In the experiments, we use a 30-days' ad click-through log from a commercial search engine. The results show that using our proposed features under a learning to rank framework, we can well rank users who potentially interest in an advertisement.},

Most existing multimedia search engines are able to automatically expand a list of textual query terms based on text search techniques, which can be called textual query expansion (TQE). However, the annotations (title and tag) around web videos are generally noisier for text-only query expansion and search matching. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal query expansion (MMQE) framework for web video search to solve the issue. Compared with traditional methods, MMQE provides a more intuitive query suggestion by transforming tex-tual query to visual presentation based on visual clustering. Paral-lel to this, MMQE can enhance the process of search matching with strong pertinence of intent-specific query by joining textual, visual and social cues from both metadata and content of videos. Experimental results on real web videos from YouTube demon-strate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Furthermore, utilizing a relationship-net (R-net) that represents relationships among known categories, we improve the classification effectiveness for those ambiguous queries whose predicted category in this relationship-net is related to the category of a query within the window. Our results indicate that the hybrid approach (DQW+R-net) statistically significantly improves the Conditional Random Field (CRF) query classification approach when static query windowing and hierarchical taxonomy are used (SQW+Tax), in terms of precision (10.8%), recall (13.2%), and F1 measure (11.9%).},

abstract = {User queries to search engines are observed to predominantly contain inflected content words but lack stopwords and capitalization. Thus, they often resemble natural language queries after case folding and stopword removal. Query recovery aims to generate a linguistically well-formed query from a given user query as input to provide natural language processing tasks and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). The evaluation of query translation shows that translation scores (NIST and BLEU) decrease after case folding, stopword removal, and stemming. A baseline method for query recovery reconstructs capitalization and stopwords, which considerably increases translation scores and significantly increases mean average precision for a standard CLIR task.},

abstract = {Novelty detection is a difficult task, particularly at sentence level. Most of the approaches proposed in the past consist of re-ordering all sentences following their novelty scores. However, this re-ordering has usually little value. In fact, a naive baseline with no novelty detection capabilities yields often better performance than any state-of-the-art novelty detection mechanism. We argue here that this is because current methods initiate too early the novelty detection process. When few sentences have been seen, it is unlikely that the user is negatively affected by redundancy. Therefore, re-ordering the first sentences may be harmful in terms of performance. We propose here a query-dependent method based on cluster analysis to determine where we must start filtering redundancy.},

Minimizing this entropy leads to an optimal entropy cycle where images are connected in the semantic order. During classification, the training step is to find an optimal entropy cycle in each class. In the test step, an unknown image is grouped into a class if the entropy increase as the result of inserting the image into the cycle of this class is relatively least. The proposed approach can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where images with same objects are taken in multiple views. Experimental results show that this entropy descriptor performs well in image classification and has potential in the image-based modeling retrieval.},

We make a significant contribution to the theoretical development of PT and show that under certain circumstances PT upholds the QPRP, and thus guarantees an optimal ranking according to the QPRP. A practical implication of this finding is that the parameters of PT can be automatically estimated via the QPRP, instead of resorting to extensive parameter tuning.},

In this paper, we propose to utilize the search session information before a query as its context to address this limitation. We propose to improve two classical NER solutions by utilizing the search session context, which are known as Conditional Random Field (CRF) based solution and Topic Model based solution respectively. In both approaches, the relationship between current focused query and previous queries in the same session are used to extract novel context aware features. Experimental results on real user search session data show that the NERQ algorithms using search session context performs significantly better than the algorithms using only information of the short queries.},

abstract = {Patent search tasks are difficult and challenging, often requiring expert patent analysts to spend hours, even days, sourcing relevant information. To aid them in this process, analysts use Information Retrieval systems and tools to cope with their retrieval tasks. With the growing interest in patent search, it is important to determine their requirements and expectations of the tools and systems that they employ. In this poster, we report a subset of the findings of a survey of patent analysts conducted to elicit their search requirements.},

In the web environment, accurate performance prediction is challenging because measures such as clarity that work well on homogeneous TREC-like collections, are not as effective and are often expensive to compute. We present Rank-time Performance Prediction (RAPP), an effective and efficient approach for online performance prediction on the web. RAPP uses retrieval scores, and aggregates of the rank-time features used by the document- ranking algorithm to train regressors for query performance prediction. On a set of over 12,000 queries sampled from the query logs of a major search engine, RAPP achieves a linear correlation of 0.78 with DCG@5, and 0.52 with NDCG@5. Analysis of prediction accuracy shows that hard queries are easier to identify while easy queries are harder to identify.},

A careful selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant document with the help of an oracle can actually improve retrieval performance dramatically (by &gt; 60%). Further, we show that instability in PRF techniques is mainly due to wrong selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant documents.

abstract = {In this poster, we propose a novel document summarization approach named Ontology-enriched Multi-Document Summarization(OMS) for utilizing background knowledge to improve summarization results. OMS first maps the sentences of input documents onto an ontology, then links the given query to a specific node in the ontology, and finally extracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the query node. By using the domain-related ontology, OMS can better capture the semantic relevance between the query and the sentences, and thus lead to better summarization results. As a byproduct, the final summary generated by OMS can be represented as a tree showing the hierarchical relationships of the extracted sentences. Evaluation results on the collection of press releases by Miami-Dade County Department of Emergency Management during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of OMS.},

Perhaps one of the most well-known and most used algorithms for result set diversification is that of Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR). In this paper, we show that while MMR is somewhat ad-hoc and motivated from a purely pragmatic perspective, we can derive a more principled variant via probabilistic inference in a latent variable graphical model. This novel derivation presents a formal probabilistic latent view of MMR (PLMMR) that (a) removes the need to manually balance relevance and diversity parameters, (b) shows that specific definitions of relevance and diversity metrics appropriate to MMR emerge naturally, and (c) formally derives variants of latent semantic indexing (LSI) similarity metrics for use in PLMMR. Empirically, PLMMR outperforms MMR with standard term frequency based similarity and diversity metrics since PLMMR maximizes latent diversity in the results.},

abstract = {In this poster, we develop a novel method, called HCC, for hierarchical co-clustering. HCC brings together two interrelated but distinct themes from clustering: hierarchical clustering and co-clustering.The goal of the former theme is to organize clusters into a hierarchy that facilitates browsing and navigation, while the goal of the latter theme is to cluster different types of data simultaneously by making use of the relationship information. Our initial empirical results are promising and they demonstrate that simultaneously attempting both these goals in a single model leads to improvements over models that focus on a single goal.},

abstract = {In information retrieval (IR), research aiming to reduce the cost of retrieval system evaluations has been conducted along two lines: (i) the evaluation of IR systems with reduced amounts of manual relevance assessments, and (ii) the fully automatic evaluation of IR systems, thus foregoing the need for manual assessments altogether. The proposed methods in both areas are commonly evaluated by comparing their performance estimates for a set of systems to a ground truth (provided for instance by evaluating the set of systems according to mean average precision). In contrast, in this poster we compare an automatic system evaluation approach directly to two evaluations based on incomplete manual relevance assessments. For the particular case of TREC's Million Query track, we show that the automatic evaluation leads to results which are highly correlated to those achieved by approaches relying on incomplete manual judgments.},

In order to account for various information needs associated with a query, diversification seems to be a reasonable strategy. By diversifying the result set, we increase the probability of results being relevant to the user's information needs when the given query is ambiguous. A diverse result set must contain a set of documents that cover various subtopics for a given query. We propose a graph based method which exploits the link structure of the web to return a ranked list that provides complete coverage for a query. Our method not only provides diversity to the results set, but also avoids excessive redundancy. Moreover, the probability of relevance of a document is conditioned on the documents that appear before it in the result list. We show the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with a query-likelihood model as the baseline.},

Results demonstrate page freshness can be better quantified when combining with temporal freshness correlation. Experiments on a real-world archival web corpus show that incorporating the combined page freshness into the searching process can improve ranking performance significantly on both relevance and freshness.},

The results show a significant improvement in retrieval performance, in terms of discounted cumulated gain, when ranking entity facets with GBDT trained on the COEC model.

abstract = {Learning to understand user search intents from their online behaviors is crucial for both Web search and online advertising. However, it is a challenging task to collect and label a sufficient amount of high quality training data for various user intents such as "compare products", "plan a travel", etc. Motivated by this bottleneck, we start with some user common sense, i.e. a set of rules, to generate training data for learning to predict user intents. The rule-generated training data are however hard to be used since these data are generally imperfect due to the serious data bias and possible data noises. In this paper, we introduce a Co-learning Framework (CLF) to tackle the problem of learning from biased and noisy rule-generated training data. CLF firstly generates multiple sets of possibly biased and noisy training data using different rules, and then trains the individual user search intent classifiers over different training datasets independently. The intermediate classifiers are then used to categorize the training data themselves as well as the unlabeled data. The confidently classified data by one classifier are added to other training datasets and the incorrectly classified ones are instead filtered out from the training datasets. The algorithmic performance of this iterative learning procedure is theoretically guaranteed.},

Such representations preserve distance and ordering information between the words, and provide a much richer representation of the underlying text. This approach enables knowledge discovery from text which is not possible with the use of a pure vector-space representation, because it loses much less information about the ordering of the underlying words. Furthermore, this representation does not require the development of new mining and management techniques. This is because the technique can also be converted into a structural version of the vector-space representation, which allows the use of all existing tools for text. In addition, existing techniques for graph and XML data can be directly leveraged with this new representation. Thus, a much wider spectrum of algorithms is available for processing this representation.},

abstract = {Search corpora are growing larger and larger: over the last 10 years, the IR research community has moved from the several hundred thousand documents on the TREC disks to the tens of millions of U.S. government web pages of GOV2 to the one billion general-interest web pages in the new ClueWeb09 collection. But traditional means of acquiring relevance judgments and evaluating - e.g. pooling documents to calculate average precision - do not seem to scale well to these new large collections. They require substantially more cost in human assessments for the same reliability in evaluation; if the additional cost goes over the assessing budget, errors in evaluation are inevitable.Some alternatives to pooling that support low-cost and reliable evaluation have recently been proposed. A number of them have already been used in TREC and other evaluation forums (TREC Million Query, Legal, Chemical, Web, Relevance Feedback Tracks, CLEF Patent IR, INEX). Evaluation via implicit user feedback (e.g. clicks) and crowdsourcing have also recently gained attention in the community. Thus it is important that the methodologies, the analysis they support, and their strengths and weaknesses are well-understood by the IR community. Furthermore, these approaches can support small research groups attempting to start investigating new tasks on new corpora with relatively low cost. Even groups that do not participate in TREC, CLEF, or other evaluation conferences can benefit from understanding how these methods work, how to use them, and what they mean as they build test collections for tasks they are interested in.The goal of this tutorial is to provide attendees with a comprehensive overview of techniques to perform low cost (in terms of judgment effort) evaluation. A number of topics will be covered, including alternatives to pooling, evaluation measures robust to incomplete judgments, evaluating with no relevance judgments, statistical inference of evaluation metrics, inference of relevance judgments, query selection, techniques to test the reliability of the evaluation and reusability of the constructed collections.The tutorial should be of interest to a wide range of attendees. Those new to the field will come away with a solid understanding of how low cost evaluation methods can be applied to construct inexpensive test collections and evaluate new IR technology, while those with intermediate knowledge will gain deeper insights and further understand the risks and gains of low cost evaluation. Attendees should have a basic knowledge of the traditional evaluation framework (Cranfield) and metrics (such as average precision and nDCG), along with some basic knowledge on probability theory and statistics. More advanced concepts will be explained during the tutorial.},

Having a working understanding of these principles can help researchers understand existing retrieval models better and also provide industrial practitioners with an understanding of how such models can be applied to real world problems.This half-day tutorial will cover the fundamentals of two dominant probabilistic frameworks for Information Retrieval: the classical probabilistic model and the language modeling approach. The elements of the classical framework will include the probability ranking principle, the binary independence model, the 2-Poisson model, and the widely used BM25 model. Within language modeling framework, we will discuss various distributional assumptions and smoothing techniques. Special attention will be devoted to the event spaces and independence assumptions underlying each approach. The tutorial will outline several techniques for modeling term dependence and addressing vocabulary mismatch. We will also survey applications of probabilistic models in the domains of cross-language and multimedia retrieval. The tutorial will conclude by suggesting a set of open problems in probabilistic models of IR.Attendees should have a basic familiarity with probability and statistics. A brief refresher of basic concepts, including random variables, event spaces, conditional probabilities, and independence will be given at the beginning of the tutorial.

abstract = {This tutorial is concerned with creating the best possible multimedia search experience. The intriguing bit here is that the query itself can be a multimedia excerpt: For example, when you walk around in an unknown place and stumble across an interesting landmark, would it not be great if you could just take a picture with your mobile phone and send it to a service that finds a similar picture in a database and tells you more about the building - and about its significance for that matter?The ideas for this type of search have been around for a decade, but this tutorial will look at recent successes and take stock of the state-of-the-art. It examines the full matrix of a variety of query modes versus document types. How do you retrieve a music piece by humming? What if you want to find news video clips on forest fires using a still image? The tutorial discusses underlying techniques and common approaches to facilitate multimedia search engines: metadata driven search; piggy-back text search where automated processes create text surrogates for multimedia; automated image annotation; content-based search. The latter is studied in more depth looking at features and distances, and how to effectively combine them for efficient retrieval, to a point where the participants have the ingredients and recipe in their hands for building their own visual search engines.Supporting users in their resource discovery mission when hunting for multimedia material is not a technological indexing problem alone. We will briefly look at interactive ways of engaging with repositories through browsing and relevance feedback, roping in geographical context, and providing visual summaries for videos. The tutorial emphasises state-of-the-art research in the area of multimedia information retrieval, which gives an indication of the research and development trends and, thereby, a glimpse of the future world.},

abstract = {Web retrieval methods have evolved through three major steps in the last decade or so. They started from standard document-centric IR in the early days of the Web, then made a major step forward by leveraging the structure of the Web, using link analysis techniques in both crawling and ranking challenges. A more recent, no less important but maybe more discrete step forward, has been to enter the user in this equation in two ways: (1) implicitly, through the analysis of usage data captured by query logs, and session and click information in general, the goal being to improve ranking as well as to measure user's happiness and engagement; (2) explicitly, by offering novel interactive features; the goal here being to better answer users' needs. In this tutorial, we will cover the user-related challenges associated with the implicit and explicit role of users in Web retrieval. We will review and discuss challenges associated with two types of activities, namely: usage data analysis and metrics and user interaction. The goal of this tutorial is to teach the key principles and technologies behind the activities and challenges briefly outlined above, bring new understanding and insights to the attendees, and hopefully foster future research.},

abstract = {Computational advertising is an emerging scientific sub-discipline, at the intersection of large scale search and text analysis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, and microeconomics. The central challenge of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The aim of this tutorial is to present the state of the art in Computational Advertising, in particular in its IR-related aspects, and to expose the participants to the current research challenges in this field. The tutorial does not assume any prior knowledge of Web advertising, and will begin with a comprehensive background survey. Going deeper, our focus will be on using a textual representation of the user context to retrieve relevant ads. At first approximation, this process can be reduced to a conventional setup by constructing a query that describes the user context and executing the query against a large inverted index of ads. We show how to augment this approach using query expansion and text classification techniques tuned for the ad-retrieval problem. In particular, we show how to use the Web as a repository of query-specific knowledge and use the Web search results retrieved by the query as a form of a relevance feedback and query expansion. We also present solutions that go beyond the conventional bag of words indexing by constructing additional features using a large external taxonomy and a lexicon of named entities obtained by analyzing the entire Web as a corpus. The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to a potpourri of recent research results and open problems inspired by Computational Advertising challenges in text summarization, natural language generation, named entity recognition, computer-human interaction, and other SIGIR-relevant areas.},

abstract = {Knowledge automatically extracted from text captures instances, classes of instances and relations among them. In particular, the acquisition of class attributes (e.g., "top speed", "body style" and "number of cylinders" for the class of "sports cars") from text is a particularly appealing task and has received much attention recently, given its natural fit as a building block towards the far-reaching goal of constructing knowledge bases from text. This tutorial provides an overview of extraction methods developed in the area of Web-based information extraction, with the purpose of acquiring attributes of open-domain classes. The attributes are extracted for classes organized either as a flat set or hierarchically. The extraction methods operate over unstructured or semi-structured text available within collections of Web documents, or over relatively more intriguing data sources consisting of anonymized search queries. The methods take advantage of weak supervision provided in the form of seed examples or small amounts of annotated data, or draw upon knowledge already encoded within human-compiled resources (e.g., Wikipedia). The more ambitious methods, aiming at acquiring as many accurate attributes from text as possible for hundreds or thousands of classes covering a wide range of domains of interest, need to be designed to scale to Web collections. This restriction has significant consequences on the overall complexity and choice of underlying tools, in order for the extracted attributes to ultimately aid information retrieval in general and Web search in particular, by producing relevant attributes for open-domain classes, along with other types of relations among instances or among classes.},

abstract = {Federated search refers to the brokered retrieval of content from a set of auxiliary retrieval systems instead of from a single, centralized retrieval system. Federated search tasks occur in, for example, digital libraries (where documents from several retrieval systems must be seamlessly merged) or peer-to-peer information retrieval (where documents distributed across a network of local indexes must be retrieved).In the context of web search, aggregated search refers to the integration of non-web content (e.g. images, videos, news articles, maps, tweets) into a web search result page. This is in contrast with classic web search where users are presented with a ranked list consisting exclusively of general web documents. As in other federated search situations, the non-web content is often retrieved from auxiliary retrieval systems (e.g. image or video databases, news indexes).Although aggregated search can be seen as an instance of federated search, several aspects make aggregated search a unique and compelling research topic. These include large sources of evidence (e.g. click logs) for deciding what non-web items to return, constrained interfaces (e.g. mobile screens), and a very heterogeneous set of available auxiliary resources (e.g. images, videos, maps, news articles). Each of these aspects introduces problems and opportunities not addressed in the federated search literature.Aggregated search is an important future research direction for information retrieval. All major search engines now provide aggregated search results. As the number of available auxiliary resources grows, deciding how to effectively surface content from each will become increasingly important.The goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of federated search and aggregated search techniques for an intermediate information retrieval researcher. At the same time, the content will be valuable for practitioners in industry. We will take the audience through the most influential work in these areas and describe how they relate to real world aggregated search systems. We will also list some of the new challenges confronted in aggregated search and discuss directions for future work.},

abstract = {Many information retrieval (IR) systems suffer from a radical variance in performance when responding to users' queries. Even for systems that succeed very well on average, the quality of results returned for some of the queries is poor. Thus, it is desirable that IR systems will be able to identify "difficult" queries in order to handle them properly. Understanding why some queries are inherently more difficult than others is essential for IR, and a good answer to this important question will help search engines to reduce the variance in performance, hence better servicing their customer needs.The high variability in query performance has driven a new research direction in the IR field on estimating the expected quality of the search results, i.e. the query difficulty, when no relevance feedback is given. Estimating the query difficulty is a significant challenge due to the numerous factors that impact retrieval performance. Many prediction methods have been proposed recently. However, as many researchers observed, the prediction quality of state-of-the-art predictors is still too low to be widely used by IR applications. The low prediction quality is due to the complexity of the task, which involves factors such as query ambiguity, missing content, and vocabulary mismatch.The goal of this tutorial is to expose participants to the current research on query performance prediction (also known as query difficulty estimation). Participants will become familiar with states-of-the-art performance prediction methods, and with common evaluation methodologies for prediction quality. We will discuss the reasons that cause search engines to fail for some of the queries, and provide an overview of several approaches for estimating query difficulty. We then describe common methodologies for evaluating the prediction quality of those estimators, and some experiments conducted recently with their prediction quality, as measured over several TREC benchmarks. We will cover a few potential applications that can utilize query difficulty estimators by handling each query individually and selectively based on its estimated difficulty. Finally we will summarize with a discussion on open issues and challenges in the field.},

Currently, a commercial search engine receives billions of queries and collects tera-bytes of log data on any single day. Other than search log data, browse logs can be collected by client-side browser plug-ins, which record the browse information if users' permissions are granted. Such massive amounts of search/browse log data, on the one hand, provide great opportunities to mine the wisdom of crowds and improve search results as well as online advertisement. On the other hand, designing effective and efficient methods to clean, model, and process large scale log data also presents great challenges.In this tutorial, we focus on mining search and browse log data for Web information retrieval. We consider a Web information retrieval system consisting of four components, namely, query understanding, document understanding, query-document matching, and user understanding. Accordingly, we organize the tutorial materials along these four aspects. For each aspect, we will survey the major tasks, challenges, fundamental principles, and state-of-the-art methods.The goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic survey on large-scale search/browse log mining to the IR community. It will help IR researchers to get familiar with the core challenges and promising directions in log mining. At the same time, this tutorial may also serve the developers of Web information retrieval systems as a comprehensive and in-depth reference to the advanced log mining techniques.},

abstract = {Plagiarism, the unacknowledged reuse of text, has increased in recent years due to the large amount of texts readily available. For instance, recent studies claim that nowadays a high rate of student reports include plagiarism, making manual plagiarism detection practically infeasible.Automatic plagiarism detection tools assist experts to analyse documents for plagiarism. Nevertheless, the lack of standard collections with cases of plagiarism has prevented accurate comparing models, making differences hard to appreciate. Seminal efforts on the detection of text reuse [2] have fostered the composition of standard resources for the accurate evaluation and comparison of methods. The aim of this PhD thesis is to address three of the main problems in the development of better models for automatic plagiarism detection: (i) the adequate identification of good potential sources for a given suspicious text; (ii) the detection of plagiarism despite modifications, such as words substitution and paraphrasing (special stress is given to cross-language plagiarism); and (iii) the generation of standard collections of cases of plagiarism and text reuse in order to provide a framework for accurate comparison of models. Regarding difficulties (i) and (ii) , we have carried out preliminary experiments over the METER corpus [2]. Given a suspicious document dq and a collection of potential source documents D, the process is divided in two steps. First, a small subset of potential source documents D* in D is retrieved. The documents d in D* are the most related to dq and, therefore, the most likely to include the source of the plagiarised fragments in it. We performed this stage on the basis of the Kullback-Leibler distance, over a subsample of document's vocabularies. Afterwards, a detailed analysis is carried out comparing dq to every d in D* in order to identify potential cases of plagiarism and their source. This comparison was made on the basis of word n-grams, by considering n = {2, 3}. These n-gram levels are flexible enough to properly retrieve plagiarised fragments and their sources despite modifications [1]. The result is offered to the user to take the final decision. Further experiments were done in both stages in order to compare other similarity measures, such as the cosine measure, the Jaccard coefficient and diverse fingerprinting and probabilistic models.One of the main weaknesses of currently available models is that they are unable to detect cross-language plagiarism. Approaching the detection of this kind of plagiarism is of high relevance, as the most of the information published is written in English, and authors in other languages may find it attractive to make use of direct translations. Our experiments, carried out over parallel and a comparable corpora, show that models of "standard" cross-language information retrieval are not enough. In fact, if the analysed source and target languages are related in some way (common linguistic ancestors or technical vocabulary), a simple comparison based on character n-grams seems to be the option. However, in those cases where the relation between the implied languages is weaker, other models, such as those based on statistical machine translation, are necessary [3]. We plan to perform further experiments, mainly to approach the detection of cross-language plagiarism. In order to do that, we will use the corpora developed under the framework of the PAN competition on plagiarism detection (cf. PAN@CLEF: http://pan.webis.de). Models that consider cross-language thesauri and comparison of cognates will also be applied.},

One reason is that, with current tools, is difficult to observe experts as a means of acquiring search expertise in a scalable fashion. This calls for a redesign of computer-mediated communication tools to make individual search strategies visible to other users. I present a research agenda to investigate this claim, which draws upon theories of social learning. I use design-based research to build novel systems that enable imitation-based learning of search expertise.},

abstract = {Entity information management (EIM) deals with organizing, processing and delivering information about entities. Its emergence is a result of satisfying more sophisticated information needs that go beyond document search. In the recent years, entity retrieval has attracted much attention in the IR community. INEX has started the XML Entity Ranking track since 2007 and TREC has launched the Entity track since 2009 to investigate the problem of related entity finding. Some EIM problems go beyond retrieval and ranking such as: 1) entity profiling, which is about characterizing a specific entity, and 2) entity distillation, which is about discovering the trend about an entity. These problems have received less attention while they have many important applications.On the other hand, the entities in the real world or in the Web environment are usually not isolated. They are connected or related with each other in one way or another. For example, the coauthorship makes the authors with similar research interests be connected. The emergence of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube has further interweaved the related entities in a much larger scale. Millions of users in these sites can become friends, fans or followers of others, or taggers or commenters of different types of entities (e.g., bookmarks, photos and videos). These networks are complex in the sense that they are heterogeneous with multiple types of entities and of interactions, they are large-scale, they are multi-lingual, and they are dynamic. These features of the complex networks go beyond traditional social network analysis and require further research.In this proposed research, I investigate entity information management in the environment of complex networks. The main research question is: how can the EIM tasks be facilitated by modeling the content and structure of complex networks? The research is in the intersection of content based information retrieval and complex network analysis, which deals with both unstructured text data and structured networks. The specific targeting EIM tasks are entity retrieval, entity profiling and entity distillation. In addition to the main research question, the following questions are considered: How can we accomplish a EIM task involving diverse entity and interaction types? How to model the evolution of entity profiles as well as the underlying complex networks? How can the existing cross-language IR work be leveraged to build entity profiles with multi-lingual evidence?I propose to use probabilistic models and discriminative models in particular to address the above research questions. In my research, I have developed discriminative models for expert search to integrate arbitrary document features [3] and to learn flexible combination strategies to rank experts in heterogeneous information sources [1]. Discriminative graphical models are proposed to jointly discover homepages by inference on the homepage dependence network [2]. The dependence of table elements is exploited to collectively perform the entity retrieval task [4]. These works have shown the power of discriminative models for entity search and the benefits of utilizing the dependencies among related entities. What I would like to do next is to develop a unified probabilistic framework to investigate the research questions raised in this proposal.},

abstract = {Since its introduction, social media, "a group of internet-based applications that (...) allow the creation and exchange of user generated content" [1], has attracted more and more users. Over the years, many platforms have arisen that allow users to publish information, communicate with others, connect to like-minded, and share anything a users wants to share. Text-centric examples are mailing lists, forums, blogs, community question answering, collaborative knowledge sources, social networks, and microblogs, with new platforms starting all the time. Given the volume of information available in social media, ways of accessing this information intelligently are needed; this is the scope of my research.Why should we care about information in social media? Here are three examples that motivate my interest. (A) Viewpoint research; someone wants to take note of the viewpoints on a particular issue. (B) Answers to problems; many problems have been encountered before, and people have shared solutions. (C) Product development; gaining insight into how people use a product and what features they wish for, eases the development of new products. Looking at these examples of information need in social media, we observe that they revolve not just around relevance in the traditional sense (i.e., objects relevant to a given topic), but also around criteria like credibility, authority, viewpoints, expertise, and experiences. However, these additional aspects are typically conditioned on the topical relevance of information objects.In social media, "information objects" come in several types but many are utterances created by people (blog posts, emails, questions, answers, tweets). People and their utterances offer two natural entry points to information contained in social media: utterances that are relevant and people that are of interest. I focus on three tasks in which the interaction between the two is key.},

abstract = {Over the last few years both availability and accessibility of current news stories on the Web have dramatically improved. In particular, users can now access news from a variety of sources hosted on the Web, from newswire presences such as the New York Times, to integrated news search within Web search engines. However, of central interest is the emerging impact that user-generated content (UGC) is having on this online news landscape. Indeed, the emergence of Web 2.0 has turned a static news consumer base into a dynamic news machine, where news stories are summarised and commented upon. In summary, value is being added to each news story in terms of additional content.Importantly, however, while there has been movement in commercial circles to exploit this extra value to enrich online news, there has been little research from the academic community on how can be achieved. Indeed, the main purpose of this thesis is to research practical techniques for the integration of UGC to improve the news search component of the most ubiquitous of Web tools, i.e the Web search engine.},

abstract = {Using data collections available on the Internet has for many people became the main medium for staying informed about the world. Many of these collections are in nature dynamic, evolving as the subjects they describe change. The goal of different research areas is to identify and highlight these changes to better enable readers to track stories. In this work we restrict ourselves to news collections and investigate "real-life" effectiveness and usability of temporal text mining (TTM) story tracking methods. We propose a new story tracking method and build a tool to support it. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness and usability of story tracking methods and define a new frameworks for automatic and user oriented evaluation. We built methods and tools which allow for understanding, discovery, and search through user interaction. Although there are many TTM methods developed there is a lack of common evaluation procedure. Therefore, we propose an evaluation framework for measuring how different TTM methods discover novel "facts". Apart from the automatic evaluation we are interested in how can users interact with pattens and learn about the underlying subjects of the story they track. For this purpose we propose a user testing environment that measures speed and accuracy in which users can use story tracking methods to discover predefined sets of ground-truth sentences.},

abstract = {A number of projects are dedicated to creating digital libraries from scanned books, such as Google Books, UDL, Digital Library of India (DLI), etc. The ability to search in the content of document images is essential for the usability and popularity of these DLs. In this work, we aim toward building a retrieval system over 120K document images coming from 1000 scanned books of Telugu literature. This is a challenge because: i) OCRs are not robust enough for Indian languages, especially the Telugu script, ii) the document images contain large number of degradations and artifacts, iii) scalability to large collections is hard. Moreover, users expect that the search system accept text queries and retrieve relevant results in interactive times.We propose a Reverse Annotation framework [1], that labels word-images by their equivalent text label in the offline phase. Reverse Annotation applies a retrieval based approach to recognition. Unlike traditional annotation/recognition that identifies keywords for data, Reverse Annotation identifies data that corresponds to a given keyword. It first selects a set of keywords which are considered useful for labeling and retrieval, such as those that repeat often, and ignoring stopwords and rare-words. Exemplars are obtained for each word from a crude OCR or human annotations. The labels are then propagated across the rest of the collection by matching words in the image-feature space. Since such a matching is computationally expensive, scalability is achieved using a fast approximate nearest neighbor technique based on Hierarchical K-Means. Once text labels are assigned, each document image is considered a bag-of-words over the labeled keywords. A standard search engine is used to build a search index for quick online retrieval. An example query and the retrieved results are shown in Figure 1. We are unaware of any conventional OCRs which can retrieve such images for the given query.There are three major contributions of our work: i) recognizing the entire document collection together, instead of one-at-a-time; this means that the repetition of words in the test set is effectively used for improving accuracy, ii) speeding up recognition by clustering multiple instances of a given word, iii) recognising at the word-level, avoiding the pitfalls of character segmentation and recognition. Other OCR techniques that use word-level context still rely on inaccurate component-level classification.Using the techniques developed from this work, we were able to successfully build a retrieval system over our challenging dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest collection of document images that has been made searchable for any Indian language. Our algorithm is easily scalable to larger collections, and directly applicable to documents from other language scripts.The first issue to discuss, is the fraction of word-images that remain unrecognized at the end of the Reverse Annotation phase. Rare-words, nouns etc. are not labeled in the test set. It is important to estimate the cost of not being able to answer such queries. If this cost is indeed high, we need to explore methods to label such infrequently occurring words in the collection. Needless to say, such methods should be computationally efficient without compromising on accuracy.The other major issue to discuss is the evaluation of retrieval results. The true recall of the retrieval system cannot be computed, since it is impossible to identify every occurrence of the given query in such large data. Questions to be considered include: whether precision alone is a sufficient indicator of retrieval performance; whether there is some better document-level effectiveness assessment possible; and how best to estimate the relative satisfaction of the user's information need.},

abstract = {Recently, user generated data is growing rapidly and becoming one of the most important source of information in the web. Blogosphere (the collection of blogs on the web) is one of the main source of information in this category. In my work for my PhD, I mainly focussed on the blog distillation task which is: given a user query find the blogs that are most related to the query topic [3].There are some properties of blogs that make blog analysis different from usual text analysis. One of these properties is related to the time stamp assigned to each post; it is possible that the topics of a blog change over the time and this can affect blog relevance to the query. Also each post in a blog can have viewer generated comments that can change the relevance of the blog to the query if these are considered as part of the content of the blog. Another property is related to the meaning of the links between blogs which are different than links between websites. Finally, blog distillation is different from traditional ad-hoc search since the retrieval unit is a blog (a collection of posts), instead of a single document. With this view, blog distillation is similar to the task of resource selection in federated search [1].Researchers have applied different methods from similar problems to blog distillation like ad-hoc search methods, expert search algorithms or methods from resource selection in distributed information retrieval.Based on our preliminary experiments, I decided to divide the blog distillation problem into two sub-problems. First of all, I want to use mentioned properties of blogs to retrieve the most relevant posts for a given query. This part is very similar to the ad hoc retrieval. After that, I want to aggregate relevance of posts in each blog and calculate relevance of the blog. This part requires the development of a cross-modal aggregation model that combines the different blog relevance clues found in the blogosphere.We use structure based smoothing methods for improving posts retrieval. The idea behind these smoothing methods is to change the score of a document based on the score of its similar or related documents. We model the blogosphere as a single graph that represents relations between posts and terms [2]. The idea is that in accordance with the Clustering Hypothesis, related documents should have similar scores for the same query. To model the relatedness between posts, we define a new measure which takes into account both content similarity and temporal distance.In more recent work, in the aggregation part of the problem, we model each post as evidence about relevance of a blog to the query, and use aggregation methods like Ordered Weighted Averaging operators to combine the evidence. The ordered weighted averaging operator, commonly called OWA operator, was introduced by Yager [4]. OWA provides a parametrized class of mean type aggregation operators, that can generate OR operator (Max), AND operator (Min) and any other aggregation operator between them.For the next steps, I'm thinking about capturing the temporal properties of the blogs. Bloggers can change their interests over the time or write about different topics periodically. Capturing these changes and using them in the retrieval is one the future woks that I'm interested in. Also, studying the relations between blogs and news and their effect on each other is an interesting problem.},
