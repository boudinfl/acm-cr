The implementation issues considered here are functionality, user interface and file organization. The main point of this implementation was to demonstrate that an efficient, effective and flexible system can be constructed using modern techniques.},

abstract = {Research has shown that document retrieval based on weighting functions and incorporating relevance feedback may be more effective than retrieval based on Boolean combinations. These novel methods have not been adopted by the large operational systems. In this paper, a software implementation of an 'intelligent terminal' is described. It overcomes many of the objections to non-Boolean retrieval. It is linked to an operational database via EURONET, and includes such features as the weighting of search terms, the construction and submission of search statements in the Common Command Language of EURONET, and the use of relevance feedback information to improve retrieval.},

isbn = {0387119787},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {A data organization for information retrieval (IR) systems is described which uses the structures imposed on the stored information. Trees are used as the main structure of data as information contents are often hierarchically structured (e.g. classifications, thesauri). However, these trees have been expanded to pseudo networks by so-called cross connecting paths. So-called data connecting paths link the information structures and the main data file. Terms occurring in the query formulation may be weighted. These weights are interpreted and then used by both the retrieval and ranking algorithm. One of the paramount problems is how to combine weighted query terms. Since the well-known IR schemes (Boolean retrieval, fuzzy retrieval etc.) do not work in our environment, a specific IR model was developed which allows to deduct suitable query and ranking evaluation algorithms.},

abstract = {The data model, i.e. data structures and operations needed for a system integrating the management of formated textual data (DBMIRS) are discussed. It is investigated how this data model fits into the ANSI-SPARC three schema architecture for data base management systems. The conclusion is that the DBMIRS should be regarded to be a new external data model. This would require only small changes to the concepts discussed so far for the conceptual and internal level. The advantages of this approach are:- The dichotomy between IRS and DBMS does not further exist.- The main part of the software can be used for IR systems as well as DB systems.- IR research can concentrate on the problems inherent in the retrieval of texts, e.g. automatic indexing, relevance feedback techniques.},

abstract = {In Practical retrieval environments the assumption is normally made that the terms assigned to the documents of a collection occur independently of each other. The term independence assumption is unrealistic in many cases, but its use leads to a simple retrieval algorithm. More realistic retrieval systems take into account dependencies between certain term pairs and possibly between term triples. In this study, methods are outlined for generating dependency factors for term pairs and term triples and for using them in retrieval. Evaluation output is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested methodologies.},

abstract = {Among the significant factors in assessing the suitability of a clustering technique to a given application is its stability; that is, how sensitive the algorithm is to perturbations in the input data. A number of techniques that appear to be suitable for measuring the stability of clustering have been published in the literature. The details about each of these measures, such as a description of the steps involved in their computation and an identification of precisely what they measure, are presented. These measures are considered in the context of analysing the stability characteristics of clustering techniques and are compared using a framework developed for this purpose. The question of generalizing some of these measures is addressed and the measures are also analyzed to identify conditions under which they can be reduced to one another.},

The CITE (Current Information Transfer in English) prototype system is a large-scale, weighted logic information retrieval system with natural language query input, ranked search output, dynamic user feedback and automatic associative vocabulary mapping capahilities.},

Such a case is a modified form of the Query Language for an Information Retrieval System.

abstract = {One approach to text compression is to replace high-frequency variable-length fragments of words by fixed-length codes pointing to a <u>compression table</u> containing these high-frequency fragments. It is shown that the problem of optimal fragment compression is NP-hard even if the fragments are restricted to prefixes and suffixes. This seems to be a simplest fragment compression problem which is NP-hard, since a polynomial algorithm for compressing by prefixes only (or suffixes only) has been found recently. Various compression heuristics based on using both prefixes and suffixes have been tested on large Hebrew and English texts. The best of these heuristics produce a net compression of some 37% for Hebrew and 45% for English using a prefix/suffix compression table of size 256.},
