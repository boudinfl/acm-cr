This paper outlines the design of an adaptive document retrieval system that chooses the best search strategy for a particular situation and user. In order to be able to support a variety of search strategies, a general network representation of the documents and terms in the database is proposed. This network representation leads to efficient methods of generating and using document and term classifications.One of the most desirable features of an adaptive system would be the ability to learn from experience. A method of incorporating this learning ability into the system is described. The adaptive control strategy for choosing search strategies enables the system to base its actions on a number of factors, including a model of the current user.Finally, some ideas for a flexible interface for casual users are suggested. Part of this interface is the heuristic search, which is used when searches based on formal models have failed. The heuristic search provides a browsing capability for the user.},

Similarity values and threshold values are dynamically modified to handle the above problems. Furthermore, to treat the latter problem data duplication is considered.},

abstract = {This research examined the relationship between subjects' knowledge of an area and their similarity ratings of pairs of concepts. Knowledge was operationalized as (1) test score performance, and (2) correspondence with an expert's similarity judgments. Subjects (n=55) were exposed to a three-week module on social psychology as part of their introductory psychology course. At the end of this course segment they were administered an examination and, later, a term similarity questionnaire. Students' similarity ratings related to both exam score and similarity ratings of the expert. Furthermore, as expected, test performance was strongly related (r=+.55) to the correlation with the expert's similarity judgments. A model based on term similarity judgments was proposed as a theoretical explanation of how term dependence models influence information retrieval system performance.},

The system's objective is to perform the information consultant's job in assisting a user to select the right vocabulary terms for his query. It is particularly useful for a novice user of a controlled-vocabulary, index-based retrieval system, who is not familiar with the vocabulary and the system Thesaurus. The user will enter his terms/keywords, that represent his information need, and the system will apply search procedures on its knowledge-base, and will find relevant concepts to be used as query-terms. The system is interactive; it can explain to the user why/how a concept was discovered/suggested, and it can back-track and try to find alternatives in case the user rejects a suggested concept. Two versions of the system were developed, utilizing two search and interaction strategies. Experiments will be conducted with the two alternatives in order to find out user preference and to compare performance. Performance will also be compard with an alternative "conventional" approach, which is an On-Line-Thesarus - developed as part of this study.},
