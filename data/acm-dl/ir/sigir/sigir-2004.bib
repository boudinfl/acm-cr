abstract = {Although information retrieval research has always been concerned with improving the effectiveness of search, in some applications, such as information analysis, a more specific requirement exists for high accuracy retrieval. This means that achieving high precision in the top document ranks is paramount. In this paper we present work aimed at achieving high accuracy in ad-hoc document retrieval by incorporating approaches from question answering(QA). We focus on getting the first relevant result as high as possible in the ranked list and argue that traditional precision and recall are not appropriate measures for evaluatin this task. We instead use the mean reciprocal rank(MRR) of the first relevant result. We evaluate three different methods for modifying queries to achieve high accuracy. The experiments done on TREC data provide support for the approach of using MRR and incorporating QA techniques for getting high accuracy in ad-hoc retrieval task.},

Trels consist of a list of terms believed to be relevant for a particular query as well as a list of irrelevant terms. The proposed method does not involve any document relevance judgments, and as such is not adversely affected by changes to the underlying collection. Therefore, it can better scale to very large, dynamic collections such as the Web. Moreover, this method can evaluate a system's effectiveness on an updatable "live" collection, or on collections derived from different data sources. Our experiments show that the proposed method is very highly correlated with official TREC measures.},

If we can measure properties of a retrieved set of documents which allow us to predict average precision, we can automate the decision of whether to elicit relevance feedback, or modify the retrieval system in other ways. We use meta-data attached to documents in the form of time stamps to measure the distribution of documents retrieved in response to a query, over the time domain, to create a temporal profile for a query. We define some useful features over this temporal profile. We find that using these temporal features, together with the content of the documents retrieved, we can improve the prediction of average precision for a query.},

This paper presents a series of experiments examining three different ways of building test collections where no system pooling is used. First, a collection formation technique combining manual feedback and multiple systems is adapted to work with a single retrieval system. Second, an existing method based on pooling the output of multiple manual searches is re-examined: testing a wider range of searchers and retrieval systems than has been examined before. Third, a new approach is explored where the ranked output of a single automatic search on a single retrieval system is assessed for relevance: no pooling whatsoever. Using established techniques for evaluating the quality of relevance judgments, in all three cases, test collections are formed that are as good as TREC.},

One basic research question is thus what exactly are these "necessary" heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval performance. In this paper, we present a formal study of retrieval heuristics. We formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval function should satisfy, and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions. We find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally. Empirical results show that when a constraint is not satisfied, it often indicates non-optimality of the method, and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter values, its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range. In general, we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints. Thus the proposed constraints provide a good explanation of many empirical observations and make it possible to evaluate any existing or new retrieval formula analytically.},

Our experiments on ad-hoc retrieval indicate that although maximum entropy is significantly worse than language models, support vector machines are on par with language models. We argue that the main reason to prefer SVMs over language models is their ability to learn arbitrary features automatically as demonstrated by our experiments on the home-page finding task of TREC-10.},

The distribution of XML element lengths is unlike what we usually observe in standard document collections, prompting us to revisit the issue of document length normalization. We perform a comparative analysis of arbitrary elements versus relevant elements, and show the importance of length as a parameter for XML retrieval. Within the language modeling framework, we investigate a range of techniques that deal with length either directly or indirectly. We observe a length bias introduced by the amount of smoothing, and show the importance of extreme length priors for XML retrieval. We also show that simply removing shorter elements from the index (by introducing a cut-off value) does not create an appropriate document length normalization. Even after increasing the minimal size of XML elements occurring in the index, the importance of an extreme length bias remains.},

Inappropriate indexing may result in false negatives and false positives, and improper ranking may lead to low precisions. In this paper, we propose a configurable XML information retrieval system, in which users can configure appropriate index types for XML tags and text contents. Based on users' index configurations, the system transforms XML structures into a compact tree representation, Ctree, and indexes XML text contents. To support XML ranking, we propose the concepts of "weighted term frequency" and "inverted element frequency," where the weight of a term depends on its frequency and location within an XML element as well as its popularity among similar elements in an XML dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experiments on the INEX 03 dataset and 30 content and structure (CAS) topics. The experimental results reveal that our system has significantly high precision at low recall regions and achieves the highest average precision (0.3309) as compared with 38 official INEX 03 submissions using the strict evaluation metric.},

Conventionally, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is considered effective in deriving such an indexing. LSI essentially detects the most representative features for document representation rather than the most discriminative features. Therefore, LSI might not be optimal in discriminating documents with different semantics. In this paper, a novel algorithm called Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) is proposed for document indexing. Each document is represented by a vector with low dimensionality. In contrast to LSI which discovers the global structure of the document space, LPI discovers the local structure and obtains a compact document representation subspace that best detects the essential semantic structure. We compare the proposed LPI approach with LSI on two standard databases. Experimental results show that LPI provides better representation in the sense of semantic structure.},

abstract = {The exponential growth of data demands scalable infrastructures capable of indexing and searching rich content such as text, music, and images. A promising direction is to combine information re-trieval with peer-to-peer technology for scalability, fault-tolerance, and low administration cost. One pioneering work along this di-rection is pSearch [32, 33]. pSearch places documents onto a peer-to- peer overlay network according to semantic vectors produced using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The search cost for a query is reduced since documents related to the query are likely to be co-located on a small number of nodes. Unfortunately, because of its reliance on LSI, pSearch also inherits the limitations of LSI. (1) When the corpus is large and heterogeneous, LSI's retrieval quality is inferior to methods such as Okapi. (2) The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) used in LSI is unscalable in terms of both memory consumption and computation time.This paper addresses the above limitations of LSI and makes the following contributions. (1) To reduce the cost of SVD, we reduce the size of its input matrix through document clustering and term selection. Our method retains the retrieval quality of LSI but is several orders of magnitude more efficient. (2) Through extensive experimentation, we found that proper normalization of semantic vectors for terms and documents improves recall by 76%. (3) To further improve retrieval quality, we use low-dimensional subvectors of semantic vectors to cluster documents in the overlay and then use Okapi to guide the search and document selection.},

The model is called "GaP" for Gamma-Poisson, the distributions of the first and last random variable. GaP is a factor model, that is it gives an approximate factorization of the document-term matrix into a product of matrices Λ and X. These factors have strictly non-negative terms. GaP is a generative probabilistic model that assigns finite probabilities to documents in a corpus. It can be computed with an efficient and simple EM recurrence. For a suitable choice of parameters, the GaP factorization maximizes independence between the factors. So it can be used as an independent-component algorithm adapted to document data. The form of the GaP model is empirically as well as analytically motivated. It gives very accurate results as a probabilistic model (measured via perplexity) and as a retrieval model. The GaP model projects documents and terms into a low-dimensional space of "themes," and models texts as "passages" of terms on the same theme.},

abstract = {Applying Belief Revision logic to model adaptive information retrieval is appealing since it provides a rigorous theoretical foundation to model partiality and uncertainty inherent in any information retrieval (IR) processes. In particular, a retrieval context can be formalised as a belief set and the formalised context is used to disambiguate vague user queries. Belief revision logic also provides a robust computational mechanism to revise an IR system's beliefs about the users' changing information needs. In addition, information flow is proposed as a text mining method to automatically acquire the initial IR contexts. The advantage of a belief-based IRsystem is that its IR behaviour is more predictable and explanatory. However, computational efficiency is often a concern when the belief revision formalisms are applied to large real-life applications. This paper describes our belief-based adaptive IR system which is underpinned by an efficient belief revision mechanism. Our initial experiments show that the belief-based symbolic IR model is more effective than a classical quantitative IR model. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful empirical evaluation of a logic-based IR model based on large IR benchmark collections.},

Prior research has looked at how to improve ad-hoc retrieval performance for existing queries while tuning the ranking function, or modify and expand user queries using a fixed ranking scheme using blind feedback. However, almost no research has looked at how to combine ranking function tuning and blind feedback together to improve ad-hoc retrieval performance. In this paper, we look at the performance improvement for ad-hoc retrieval from a more integrated point of view by combining the merits of both techniques. In particular, we argue that the ranking function should be tuned first, using user-provided queries, before applying the blind feedback technique. The intuition is that highly-tuned ranking offers more high quality documents at the top of the hit list, thus offers a stronger baseline for blind feedback. We verify this integrated model in a large scale heterogeneous collection and the experimental results show that combining ranking function tuning and blind feedback can improve search performance by almost 30% over the baseline Okapi system.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the Web as the corpus source to translate unknown queries for CLIR. We propose an online translation approach to determine effective translations for unknown query terms via mining of bilingual search-result pages obtained from Web search engines. This approach can alleviate the problem of the lack of large bilingual corpora, translate many unknown query terms, provide flexible query specifications, and extract semantically-close translations to benefit CLIR tasks -- especially for cross-language Web search.},

abstract = {An under-explored question in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is to what degree the performance of CLIR methods depends on the availability of high-quality translation resources for particular domains. To address this issue, we evaluate several competitive CLIR methods - with different training corpora - on test documents in the medical domain. Our results show severe performance degradation when using a general-purpose training corpus or a commercial machine translation system (SYSTRAN), versus a domain-specific training corpus. A related unexplored question is whether we can improve CLIR performance by systematically analyzing training resources and optimally matching them to target collections. We start exploring this problem by suggesting a simple criterion for automatically matching training resources to target corpora. By using cosine similarity between training and target corpora as resource weights we obtained an average of 5.6% improvement over using all resources with no weights. The same metric yields 99.4% of the performance obtained when an oracle chooses the optimal resource every time.},

We use a method that extends earlier work in this area by augmenting this with statistical analysis, and corpus-based translation disambiguation to dynamically discover translations of OOV terms.

We integrate the linkage of a query as a hidden variable, which expresses the term dependencies within the query as an acyclic, planar, undirected graph. We then assume that a query is generated from a document in two stages: the linkage is generated first, and then each term is generated in turn depending on other related terms according to the linkage. We also present a smoothing method for model parameter estimation and an approach to learning the linkage of a sentence in an unsupervised manner. The new approach is compared to the classical probabilistic retrieval model and the previously proposed language models with and without taking into account term dependencies. Results show that our model achieves substantial and significant improvements on TREC collections.},

We apply parsimonious models at three stages of the retrieval process: 1) at indexing time; 2) at search time; 3) at feedback time.

The cluster label of each data point can be easily derived from the obtained linear coefficients. This method differs from the method of clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) citeXu03 in that it can be applied to data containing negative values and the method can be implemented in the kernel space. Our experimental results show that the proposed data clustering method and its variations performs best among 11 algorithms and their variations that we have evaluated on both TDT2 and Reuters-21578 corpus. In addition to its good performance, the new method also has the merit in its easy and reliable derivation of the clustering results.},

We define parameters of categories that make it possible to acquire numerous datasets with desired properties, which in turn allow better control over categorization experiments. In particular, we develop metrics that estimate the difficulty of a dataset by examining the host directory structure. These metrics are shown to be good predictors of categorization accuracy that can be achieved on a dataset, and serve as efficient heuristics for generating datasets subject to user's requirements. A large collection of automatically generated datasets are made available for other researchers to use.},

Our sense tagger is crude, but performs consistent disambiguation by considering only the single most informative word as evidence to disambiguate the target word. We also allow multiple-sense assignment to alleviate the problem caused by incorrect disambiguation.Experimental results on a large-scale TREC collection show that our approach to improve retrieval effectiveness is successful, while most of the previous work failed to improve performances even on small text collection.

A document has a phrase if all content words in the phrase are within a window of a certain size. The window sizes for different types of phrases are different and are determined using a decision tree. Phrases are more important than individual terms. Consequently, documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority. We utilize WordNet to disambiguate word senses of query terms. Whenever the sense of a query term is determined, its synonyms, hyponyms, words from its definition and its compound words are considered for possible additions to the query. Experimental results show that our approach yields between 23% and 31% improvements over the best-known results on the TREC 9, 10 and 12 collections for short (title only) queries, without using Web data.},

In addition, it assigns to each page a geographic focus --- a locality that the page discusses as a whole. The tagging process is simple and fast, aimed to be applied to large collections of Web pages and to facilitate a variety of location-based applications and data analyses.Geotagging involves arbitrating two types of ambiguities: geo/non-geo and geo/geo. A geo/non-geo ambiguity occurs when a place name also has a non-geographic meaning, such as a person name (e.g., Berlin) or a common word (Turkey). Geo/geo ambiguity arises when distinct places have the same name, as in London, England vs. London, Ontario.An implementation of the tagger within the framework of the WebFountain data mining system is described, and evaluated on several corpora of real Web pages. Precision of up to 82% on individual geotags is achieved. We also evaluate the relative contribution of various heuristics the tagger employs, and evaluate the focus-finding algorithm using a corpus pretagged with localities, showing that as many as 91% of the foci reported are correct up to the country level.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of finding most topical named entities among all entities in a document, which we refer to as focused named entity recognition. We show that these focused named entities are useful for many natural language processing applications, such as document summarization, search result ranking, and entity detection and tracking. We propose a statistical model for focused named entity recognition by converting it into a classification problem. We then study the impact of various linguistic features and compare a number of classification algorithms. From experiments on an annotated Chinese news corpus, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve near human-level accuracy.},

By applying this proposed named entity matching model, we also develop a mining framework for discovering new, unseen named entity translations from online daily Web news.

We show that query traffic from particular topical categories differs both from the query stream as a whole and from other categories.

The Belief Distribution Algorithm retains the qualities of nearest-neighbor algorithms which have performed well in the past, yet produces predictions of belief distributions across rating values rather than a point rating value.In addition, we illustrate how the exclusive use of the mean absolute error metric has concealed these flaws for so long, and we propose the use of a modified Precision metric for more accurately evaluating the user experience.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users. The memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In these approaches, different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions. The impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration. For example, an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings. Even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem, empirical studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present an optimization algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users. More specifically, the new weighting scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting scheme substantially improves the performance of the Pearson correlation coefficient method for collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {An adaptive information filtering system monitors a document stream to identify the documents that match information needs specified by user profiles. As the system filters, it also refines its knowledge about the user's information needs based on long-term observations of the document stream and periodic feedback(training data) from the user. Low variance profile learning algorithms, such as Rocchio, work well at the early stage of filtering when the system has very few training data. Low bias profile learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, work well at the later stage of filtering when the system has accumulated enough training data.However, an empirical system needs to works well consistently at all stages of filtering process. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a new technique to combine different text classification algorithms via a constrained maximum likelihood Bayesian prior. This technique provides a trade off between bias and variance, and the combined classifier may achieve a consistent good performance at different stages of filtering. We implemented the proposed technique to combine two complementary classification algorithms: Rocchio and logistic regression. The new algorithm is shown to compare favorably with Rocchio, Logistic Regression, and the best methods in the TREC-9 and TREC-11 adaptive filtering tracks.},

abstract = {Information filtering has made considerable progress in recent years. The predominant approaches are content-based methods and collaborative methods. Researchers have largely concentrated on either of the two approaches since a principled unifying framework is still lacking. This paper suggests that both approaches can be combined under a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Individual content-based user profiles are generated and collaboration between various user models is achieved via a common learned prior distribution. However, it turns out that a parametric distribution (e.g. Gaussian) is too restrictive to describe such a common learned prior distribution. We thus introduce a nonparametric common prior, which is a sample generated from a Dirichlet process which assumes the role of a hyper prior. We describe effective means to learn this nonparametric distribution, and apply it to learn users' information needs. The resultant algorithm is simple and understandable, and offers a principled solution to combine content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Within our framework, we are now able to interpret various existing techniques from a unifying point of view. Finally we demonstrate the empirical success of the proposed information filtering methods.},

abstract = {Multi-level annotation of images is a promising solution to enable more effective semantic image retrieval by using various keywords at different semantic levels. In this paper, we propose a multi-level approach to annotate the semantics of natural scenes by using both the dominant image components and the relevant semantic concepts. In contrast to the well-known image-based and region-based approaches, we use the salient objects as the dominant image components to achieve automatic image annotation at the content level. By using the salient objects for image content representation, a novel image classification technique is developed to achieve automatic image annotation at the concept level. To detect the salient objects automatically, a set of detection functions are learned from the labeled image regions by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with an automatic scheme for searching the optimal model parameters. To generate the semantic concepts, finite mixture models are used to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects. An adaptive EM algorithm has been proposed to determine the optimal model structure and model parameters simultaneously. We have also demonstrated that our algorithms are very effective to enable multi-level annotation of natural scenes in a large-scale dataset.},

These collections are only available in image formats and require expensive manual annotation work for access to them. Current handwriting recognizers have word error rates in excess of 50% and therefore cannot be used for such material. We describe two statistical models for retrieval in large collections of handwritten manuscripts given a text query. Both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint probability distribution between features computed from word images and their transcriptions. The models can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten documents given a text query. We show experiments with a training set of 100 transcribed pages and a test set of 987 handwritten page images from the George Washington collection. Experiments show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic retrieval system for historical manuscripts using text queries, without manual transcription of the original corpus.},

This problem is not only currently pervasive on the web, but also important to the emerging semantic web. A straightforward approach to automating this process would be to learn a classifier that can classify objects from the source taxonomy into categories of the master taxonomy. The key insight is that the availability of the source taxonomy data could be helpful to build better classifiers for the master taxonomy if their categorizations have some semantic overlap. In this paper, we propose a new approach, co-bootstrapping, to enhance the classification by exploiting such implicit knowledge. Our experiments with real-world web data show substantial improvements in the performance of taxonomy integration.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions. Our system extracted useful linguistic constructs called linguistic features from raw text using information extraction tools and formulated answers based on such features. The features employed include appositives, copulas, structured patterns, relations, propositions and raw sentences. The features were ranked based on feature type and similarity to a question profile. Redundant features were detected using a simple heuristic-based strategy. The approach achieved state of the art performance at the TREC 2003 QA evaluation. Component analysis of the system was carried out using an automatic scoring function called Rouge (Lin and Hovy, 2003). Major findings include 1) answers using linguistic features are significantly better than those using raw sentences; 2) the most useful features are appositives and copulas; 3) question profiles, as a means of modeling user interests, can significantly improve system performance; 4) the Rouge scores are closely correlated with subjective evaluation results, indicating the suitability of using Rouge for evaluating definitional QA systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework and a system that extracts events relevant to a query from a collection C of documents, and places such events along a timeline. Each event is represented by a sentence extracted from C, based on the assumption that "important" events are widely cited in many documents for a period of time within which these events are of interest. In our experiments, we used queries that are event types ("earthquake") and person names (e.g. "George Bush"). Evaluation was performed using G8 leader names as queries: comparison made by human evaluators between manually and system generated timelines showed that although manually generated timelines are on average more preferable, system generated timelines are sometimes judged to be better than manually constructed ones.},

abstract = {Link Analysis has shown great potential in improving the performance of web search. PageRank and HITS are two of the most popular algorithms. Most of the existing link analysis algorithms treat a web page as a single node in the web graph. However, in most cases, a web page contains multiple semantics and hence the web page might not be considered as the atomic node. In this paper, the web page is partitioned into blocks using the vision-based page segmentation algorithm. By extracting the page-to-block, block-to-page relationships from link structure and page layout analysis, we can construct a semantic graph over the WWW such that each node exactly represents a single semantic topic. This graph can better describe the semantic structure of the web. Based on block-level link analysis, we proposed two new algorithms, Block Level PageRank and Block Level HITS, whose performances we study extensively using web data.},

The estimation of the hyperlink structure's usefulness is stable when we use different weighting schemes, or when we employ sampling of documents to reduce the computational overhead. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of the hyperlink structure's usefulness in a realistic setting, by setting the thresholds of a decision mechanism automatically. Our results show that improvements over the baselines are obtained.},

In this paper, we explore the use of page segmentation algorithms to partition web pages into blocks and investigate how to take advantage of block-level evidence to improve retrieval performance in the web context. Because of the special characteristics of web pages, different page segmentation method will have different impact on web search performance. We compare four types of methods, including fixed-length page segmentation, DOM-based page segmentation, vision-based page segmentation, and a combined method which integrates both semantic and fixed-length properties. Experiments on block-level query expansion and retrieval are performed. Among the four approaches, the combined method achieves the best performance for web search. Our experimental results also show that such a semantic partitioning of web pages effectively deals with the problem of multiple drifting topics and mixed lengths, and thus has great potential to boost up the performance of current web search engines.},

abstract = {We describe an evaluation of result set filtering techniques for providing ultra-high precision in the task of presenting related news for general web queries. In this task, the negative user experience generated by retrieving non-relevant documents has a much worse impact than not retrieving relevant ones. We adapt cost-based metrics from the document filtering domain to this result filtering problem in order to explicitly examine the tradeoff between missing relevant documents and retrieving non-relevant ones. A large manual evaluation of three simple threshold filters shows that the basic approach of counting matching title terms outperforms also incorporating selected abstract terms based on part-of-speech or higher-level linguistic structures. Simultaneously, leveraging these cost-based metrics allows us to explicitly determine what other tasks would benefit from these alternative techniques.},

abstract = {In recent years, statistical language models are being proposed as alternative to the vector space model. Viewing documents as language samples introduces the issue of defining a joint probability distribution over the terms.The present paper models a document as the result of a Markov process. It argues that this process is ergodic, which is theoretically plausible, and easy to verify in practice.The theoretical result is that the joint distribution can be easily obtained. This can also be applied for search resolutions other than the document level. We verified this in an experiment on query expansion demonstrating both the validity and the practicability of the method. This holds a promise for general language models.},

In another experiment, AnchorMap is used to compare the initial ranked document list from a single system against the ranked document list from that system after blind feedback. Again, high AnchorMap values are highly correlated with both topic difficulty and successful application of blind feedback. Both experiments are examples of using properties of a topic which are independent of relevance information to predict the actual performance of IR systems on the topic. Initial experiments to attempt to improve retrieval performance based upon AnchorMap failed; the causes for failure are discussed.},

In such a system, an individual is allowed to organize a subset of documents in a repository into a personal hierarchy and share the hierarchy with others. The system generates a "consensus" hierarchy from all users' personal hierarchies, which provides a full, common, and emergent view of all documents. We believe that collaborative filing helps translate personal, tacit knowledge into sharable structures, which help the user as well a community of which he or she is a part. Our filing system is suitable for any documents from text to multimedia files. Initial results on an experimental website show promise. For a knowledge task involving extensive document retrieval, hierarchies are not only used frequently but are also effective in identifying high quality documents. One surprising finding is how often subjects use others' personal hierarchies, and upon close examination, social networks play a key role as well.},

abstract = {Protein secondary structure prediction is an important step towards understanding the relation between protein sequence and structure. However, most current prediction methods use features difficult for biologists to interpret. In this paper, we present a new method that applies information retrieval techniques to solve the problem:we extract a context sensitive biological vocabulary for protein sequences and apply text classification methods to predict protein secondary structure. Experimental results show that our method performs comparably to the state-of-art methods. Furthermore, the context sensitive vocabularies can serve as a useful tool to discover meaningful regular expression patterns for protein structures.},

The PageRank algorithm, which is used in Google Search Engine, plays an important role on improving the quality of its resuls by employing the explicit hyperlink structure among the Web pages. The prestige of Web pages defined by PageRank is purely derived from surfer random walk on the Web graph without textual content content consideration. However, in the practical sense, user surfing behavior is far from random jumping. In this paper, we present a unified model for a more accurate page rank. User's surfing is guided by a probabilistic model that is based on literal matching between connected pages. The result shows that our proposed ranking algorithms do perform better than the original PageRank.},

However, most term-weighting schemes assume that a term is independent of the other terms. Term dependency is an indispensable consequence of language use [1]. Therefore, this assumption can make the information of a document being lost. In this paper, we propose new approach to refine term weights of documents using term dependencies discovered from a set of documents. Then, we evaluate our method with two experiments based on the vector space model [2] and the language model [3].},

Although light stemming in particular has led to improvements in information retrieval [5, 6], the effects of broken plurals on the performance of information retrieval systems has not been examined.We propose a light stemmer that incorporates a broken plural recognition component, and evaluate it within the context of information retrieval. Our results show that identifying broken plurals and reducing them to their correct stems does result in a significant improvement in the performance of information retrieval systems.},

In this paper, we compare two different normalization strategies for user ratings, namely the Gaussian normalization method and the decoupling normalization method. Particularly, we incorporated these two rating normalization methods into two collaborative filtering algorithms, and evaluated their effectiveness on the EachMovie dataset. The experiment results have shown that the decoupling method for rating normalization is more effective than the Gaussian normalization method in improving the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms.},

We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within a community and the relationships between them. Within the FISC framework, we provide viewpoint retrieval to enable a user to construct visual contextual views of the community from the perspective of any community member. To evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity matching, and we develop prototypes to explore the broader architecture and usage issues.},

abstract = {Observations from a unique investigation of failure analysis of Information Retrieval (IR) research engines are presented. The Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop invited seven leading IR research groups to supply both their systems and their experts to an effort to analyze why their systems fail on some topics and whether the failures are due to system flaws, approach flaws, or the topic itself. There were surprising results from this cross-system failure analysis. One is that despite systems retrieving very different documents, the major cause of failure for any particular topic was almost always the same across all systems. Another is that relationships between aspects of a topic are not especially important for state-of-the-art systems; the systems are failing at a much more basic level where the top-retrieved documents are not reflecting some aspect at all.},

Access to large digital image and video collections is hampered by ambiguous and incomplete metadata attributed to imagery. Though improvements are constantly made in the automatic derivation of semantic feature concepts such as indoor, outdoor, face, and cityscape, it is unclear how good these improvements should be and under what circumstances they are effective. This paper explores the relationship between metadata accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval using an amateur photo collection, documentary video, and news video. The accuracy of the feature classification is varied from performance typical of automated classifications today to ideal performance taken from manually generated truth data. Results establish an accuracy threshold at which semantic features can be useful, and empirically quantify the collection size when filtering first shows its effectiveness.},

However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of hand-labeled samples to learn correctly. To address this problem, we have proposed a semi-supervised framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, this emi-supervised framework includes: (a) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (b) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integrate the unlabeled samples to achieve parameter estimation and model selection simultaneously; The experimental results in a certain domain of medical videos are also provided.},

abstract = {Named entity tagging comprises the sub-tasks of identifying a text span and classifying it, but this view ignores the relationship between the entities and the world. Spatial and temporal entities ground events in space-time, and this relationship is vital for applications such as question answering and event tracking. There is much recent work regarding the temporal dimension (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2002, Mani and Wilson 2000), but no detailed study of the spatial dimension.I propose to investigate how spatial named entities (which are often referentially ambiguous) can be automatically resolved with respect to an extensional coordinate model (toponym resolution). To this end, various information sources including linguistic cue patterns, co-occurrence information, discourse/positional information, world knowledge (such as size and population) as well as minimality heuristics (Leidner et al. 2003) will be combined in a supervised machine learning regime.The major contributions of this research project will be a corpus of text manually annotated for spatial named entities with their model correlates as a training and evaluation resource, a novel method to spatially ground toponyms in text and a component-based evaluation based on this new reference corpus.},

abstract = {Increasingly, the World Wide Web is being viewed as a means of creating web communities rather than simply as a means of publishing and delivering documents and services. In this research we develop the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), and associated architecture, that enables community-centred information systems to be constructed. Such systems provide a way for organisations, distributed workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the World Wide Web. To support communities, we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within a community and the relationships between them: who is working on what topic, and who is working with whom. Within the FISC framework, we provide a viewpoint retrieval service to enable a user to construct visual contextual views of the community from the perspective of any community member. To evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity matching, and we develop prototypes (Web Network and "CiteSeer Community") to explore the broader architecture and usage issues.},

More effective retrieval techniques could be provided by means of transforming explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge. The approach presented in this paper is based on a peer-to-peer architecture and aims at complementing classical Web searches in terms of personalized ranking lists. These local rankings can be accumulated and evaluated in order to supplement the process of knowledge generation by building Virtual Knowledge Communities. Furthermore, the aggregation of ranking lists can be used to identify topics as well as communities of interest. Together with social aspects for community support, a framework for congenial Web search is defined.},

As a result of a survey of users' reading behaviours and of existing e-Book user interfaces, we found that most of these interfaces provide poor support for the actual processes of reading and comprehension. In particular, there is generally minimal support for understanding the overall structure (or contextual structure) and the narrative structure of a book. We propose adapting topic tracking and detection techniques to discover the narrative threads within a book, and hence its narrative structure. The contextual and narrative structures will be presented to the user through purpose-designed visualisations, which will be integrated and linked within a newly developed e-Book browser. We have chosen to use the Bible as our test corpus, as it has a rich narrative structure, and relatively complex contextual structure. Evaluation of the interface, and its components, will be done through field studies involving actual readers of the Bible, to assess the effectiveness of the user interface in enhancing a user's experience.},

Applications such as Question Answering, reading tutors, and XML retrieval demand more robust retrieval on richly annotated documents. In order to effectively serve these applications, the community will need a better understanding of the combination of evidence. In this work, I propose that the use of simple generative probabilistic models will be an effective framework for these problems. Statistical language models, which are a special case of generative probabilistic models, have been used extensively within recent Information Retrieval research. Their flexibility has been very effective in adapting to numerous tasks and problems. I propose to extend the statistical language modeling framework to handle rich information needs and documents with structural and linguistic annotations. Much of the prior work on combination of evidence has had few well-studied theoretical contributions, so I also propose to develop a sounder theoretical basis which gives more predictable results.},

abstract = {Current approaches to information retrieval rely on the creativity of individuals to develop new algorithms. In this investigation the use of genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP) to learn IR algorithms is examined.Document structure weighting is a technique whereby different parts of a document (title, abstract, etc.) contribute unevenly to the overall document weight during ranking. Near optimal weights can be learned with a GA. Doing so shows a statistically significant 5% relative improvement in MAP for vector space inner product and Croft's probabilistic ranking, but no improvement for BM25. Two applications of this approach are suggested: offline learning, and relevance feedback.In a second set of experiments, a new ranking function was learned using GP. This new function yields a statistically significant 11% relative improvement on unseen queries tested on the training documents. Portability tests to different collections (not used in training) demonstrate the performance of the new function exceeds vector space and probability, and slightly exceeds BM25. Learning weights for this new function is proposed.The application of genetic learning to stemming and thesaurus construction is discussed. Stemming rules such as those of the Porter algorithm are candidates for GP learning whereas synonym sets are candidates for GA learning.},

abstract = {This research explores the relationship between information-seeking strategies (ISSs) and information retrieval (IR) system design. When people seek information they engage in a variety of ISSs in order to search for specific items, learn about the contents of the database, evaluate retrieved information, and so on.The theoretical foundations of the work are based on the information-seeking episode model developed by Belkin (1996), and the multi-facet classification scheme of information behaviors proposed by Cool &amp; Belkin (2002).The goal of this research is to construct and evaluate an interactive retrieval system which uses different combinations of IR techniques to support different ISSs. Example IR techniques include comparison using exact and probabilistic matching algorithms; summarization of information objects using titles, snippets or abstracts; visualization techniques such as lists or classified results; and navigation techniques such as scrolling or following links. By designing a retrieval system with diverse strategies in mind, we can adaptively support multiple ISSs, permitting a user to move seamlessly from one strategy to another, choosing instantiations of each support technique tailored to the specific ISS.The research will be conducted in a series of four steps. (1) Develop an object-oriented framework for representing basic IR techniques. (2) Design, implement and evaluate systems which support individual ISSs such as browsing and searching. (3) Specify an interaction structure for guiding and controlling sequences of different supporting techniques.(4) Design, implement, and evaluate a dynamically adaptive system supporting multiple ISSs in comparison to a non-adaptive baseline system.},
