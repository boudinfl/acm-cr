abstract = {The rise of computer graphics offers a new challenge for information retrieval: how to search and retrieve information which is partly or wholly graphical. As an example, procedures for handling geographical information, such as street maps and directories are explained. With this data, it is possible to find routes on maps, retrieve locations and names of people or businesses, and draw maps. But a comparison of these programs with programs for face processing or computer typesetting makes clear how far we are from general purpose routines. Today successful graphics routines contain a great deal of local domain knowledge. There is no analog of the simple keyword systems that handle textual documents in any subject area. Just as computational linguists have found that subject matter expertise is necessary to do really sophisticated processing of English, it seems also necessary to sophisticated processing of pictures; the difference is that we don't know how to do unsophisticated processing of graphics.},

abstract = {In information retrieval, it is common to model index terms and documents as vectors in a suitably defined vector space. The main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori. For this reason, the vector space model adopted by Salton for the SMART system treats the terms as a set of orthogonal vectors. In such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate, corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms. In this paper, we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector space model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic indexing scheme. We also demonstrate how such correlations can be included with minimal modification in the existing vector based information retrieval systems. The preliminary experimental results obtained from the new model are very encouraging.},

abstract = {Experimental information retrieval (IR) systems, some dating back to the sixties, have demonstrated the viability of fully automatic document storage and retrieval methodologies with small to medium size bibliographic collections [72]. Many of these experimental systems utilize the vector space model in which each important term (such as a word stem) identifies a different dimension in a space, so that matrix methods and vector operations can be defined on queries and documents. Statistical techniques have been very effective, and probabilistic enhancements have given additional improvements [84]. However, the basic vector space model is oriented towards recording the essential information in the text of a title/abstract combination rather than describing more complex document structures. It is necessary to extend the model in order to handle composite documents.On the other hand, commonly available retrieval systems that employ Boolean logic queries and utilize inverted file storage schemes can without modification accommodate such documents, albeit with somewhat less effectiveness than is possible with more sophisticated systems. Hence, it is also of interest to consider how Boolean logic systems can be extended to give better performance, especially with composite documents, and to integrate those approaches with vector methods.},

Such systems provide rapid responses in answer to search queries but they are not easy to use by uninitiated patrons. An extended Boolean retrieval strategy has been devised in which the Boolean operators are treated more or less strictly, depending on the setting of a special parameter, known as the p-value. The extended system is much more forgiving than the conventional system, and provides better retrieval effectiveness. In this study various problems associated with the determination of appropriate p-values are discussed, and suggestions are made for an automatic assignment of p-values. Evaluation output is included to illustrate the operations of the suggested procedures.},

A number of methods are presented that avoid these difficulties. The decoding algorithms efficiently process the encoded string on a byte-per-byte basis, are faster than the original algorithm, and can be programmed in any high level language. This is achieved at the cost of storing some tables in the internal memory, but with no loss in the compression savings of the optimal Huffman codes. The internal memory space needed can be reduced either at the cost of increased processing time, or by using non-binary Huffman codes, which give sub-optimal compression. Experimental results for English and Hebrew text are also presented.},

The characteristics of such indexing can be modeled statistically and validated over a wide range of text.

These results indicate that while the absolute performance of a search on a particular collection is dependent on the pairwise similarity of the relevant documents, the relative effectiveness of clustered retrieval versus sequential retrieval is independent of this factor. However, retrieval of entire clusters in response to a query usually results in a poorer performance than retrieval of individual documents from clusters.},

Among them are high time and space complexity, difficulty of determining similarity thresholds, order dependence, nonuniform document distribution in clusters, and arbitrariness in determination of various cluster intiators. To overcome these problems to some degree, the cover coefficient based clustering methodology has been introduced. The concepts used in this methodology have created certain new concepts, relationships, and measures such as the effect of indexing on clustering, an optimal vocabulary generation for indexing, and a new matching function. These new concepts are discussed. The result of performance experiments that show the effectiveness of the clustering methodology and the matching function are also included. In these experiments, it has been also observed that the majority of the documents obtained in a search are concentrated in a few clusters containing a low percentage of documents of the database.},

abstract = {Besides the operators 'and', 'or' and 'not' the GRIPS retrieval language contains thesaurus — operators to extend the query and truncation — and context-operators for freetext and Boolean searching.In a similar way several other viewpoints and evaluation measures were defined and applied in the retrieval experiment. Under the assumption that the evaluation measure is an interval scale averaging is done by calculating the arithmetic mean.As levels of the experimental factor /8/ the following similarity measures were used: inner product measure, cosine measure, overlap measure, coefficient of Jaccard and Euclidean distance. As situative factors /8/ the number of documents retrieved by GRIPS, the number of descriptiors of the queries, generality and topic of documents were used.The retrieval experiment is not yet finished completely but several results have already been obtained. For example in the average (over 81 queries) for the above defined viewpoint the ranking with the inner product measure does not indicate a significant improvement compared with the GRIPS-output. In the case of the Euclidean distance measure it seems that in the average the user has to inspect less nonrelevant documents. This means an improvement compared with the unordered retrieved set from the GRIPS-output.For more details of the so called 'two-level retrieval process' and further experimental results we refer to the long version of this paper.},

abstract = {Retrieval tests are often performed with an inhomogeneous query collection, that means certain properties of queries vary within the collection. This paper investigates under which conditions this inhomogeneity may lead to a loss of measurement precision and validity and should be controlled by an experimental design. In particular, interrelationships between the design of a retrieval test, inhomogeneity of the query collection and measurement theoretical properties of the evaluation measure will be discussed. Based on these results, some recommendations for experimental design of retrieval tests are presented.},

abstract = {The Utah Retrieval System Architecture provides an excellent testbed for the development and testing of new algorithms or techniques for information retrieval. URSA™ is a message-based structure capable of running on a variety of system configurations, ranging from a single mainframe processor to a system distributed across a number of dissimilar processors. It can readily support a variety of specialized backend processors, such as high-speed search engines.The architecture divides the components of a text retrieval system into two classes: servers and clients. A triple of servers (index, search, and document access) for each database provide the capabilities normally associated with a retrieval system. Possible clients for these servers include a window-based user interface, whose query language can be easily modified, a connection to a mainframe host processor, or Al-based query modification programs that wish to use the database.Any module in the system can be replaced by a new module using a different algorithm as long as the new module complies with the message formats for that function. In fact, with some care this module switch can occur while the system is running, without affecting the users. A monitor program collects statistics on all system messages, giving information regarding query complexity, processing time for each module, queueing times, and bandwidths between every module.This paper discusses the background of URSA and its structure, with particular emphasis on the features that make it a good testbed for information retrieval techniques.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach, the IHF approach, of organising data of a hierarchical structure into one single file, maintaining adequate representation of the relationships among the data. The IHF approach requires each data item be stored in the basic form of name-value pair and consists in assigning each data item with identifier which provides not only the data item identification but also an implicit identification of the hierarchical structural relationships among groups of data items. Data selection and retrieval operations are effectively implemented with the concept of masking of relevant identifier bits, without resorting to any linking devices. Application of the IHF technique on CAFS is examined.},

abstract = {ANNOD is the name of a system developed at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which implements a set of linguistic and empirical techniques that permit retrieval of natural language information in response to natural language queries. The system is based on Dr. Gerard Salton's SMART [1] document retrieval system and is presently implemented on a mini-computer as part of an Interactive TExt Management System, ITEMS.[2] Actual experience with retrieval of information from NLM's Hepatitis Knowledge Base (HKB), an encyclopedic hierarchical, full-text file, is presented. The techniques used in ANNOD include: automatic stemming of words, common word deletion, thesaurus expansion, a complex empirical matching (ranking) algorithm (similarity measure), and techniques expressly designed to permit rapid response in a mini-computer environment. Preliminary testing demonstrates high efficiency in identifying portions of a text which are relevant to users.},

abstract = {An empirical study was performed to train naive subjects in the use of a prototype Boolean logic-based information retrieval system on a bibliographic database. Subjects were undergraduates with little or no prior computing experience. Subjects trained with a conceptual model of the system performed better than subjects trained with procedural instructions, but only on complex, problem-solving tasks. Performance was equal on simple tasks. Differences in patterns of interaction with the system (based on a stochastic process model) showed parallel results. Most subjects were able to articulate some description of the system's operation, but few articulated a model similar to the card catalog analogy provided in training. Eleven of 43 subjects were unable to achieve minimal competency in system use. The failure rate was equal between training conditions and genders; the only differences found between those passing and failing the benchmark test were academic major and in frequency of library use.},
