abstract = {This paper describes work in progress to develop a facility for natural language access to a variety of computer databases and database systems. This facility, called IRUS for Information Retrieval using the RUS parsing system, allows users who are unfamiliar with the technical characteristics of the underlying database system to query databases using typed English input. This system can be thought of as a stand-alone query system or as part of a management information system (MIS) or a decision support system (DSS).Many systems boast of having a "user-friendly" or "English-like" or even "English" interface so that users require a minimum of special training to use the system, but most such systems use shallow, relatively ad hoc techniques that are not robust or linguistically sound. We are using a large, well-tested, theoretically-based, general parser of English that has been developed and extended in a variety of research projects for over a decade.One of the primary emphases of IRUS is transportability, which includes three types of changes: (1) changing the domain, (2) changing data bases within the same domain, and (3) changing data base systems. The use of a general parser for English is an important part of the solution to the transportability problem, but there are other parts as well, since portions of the system beyond the parser must know the conceptual content of the domain, the way in which this is reflected in a collection of datasets, and the operating characteristics of the dbms being used to access these datasets.Other researchers have investigated similar issues [8, 5, 6, 12]. We have attacked this problem by building a knowledge-based system, with procedural components independent of domain and data base structure, directed by domain and database dependent knowledge structures. We are also building tools for conveniently creating and maintaining these knowledge structures, with an eventual goal of allowing end-users to extend and modify these knowledge structures to suit their own needs. Given this set of goals, and these tools, we consider the current implementation, which uses the System 1022 dbms on the DEC KL-2060, to be only one of a set of possible implementations, and are not constraining IRUS on the basis of 1022's strengths and weaknesses.This paper presents an overview of the IRUS system, emphasizing those aspects of the design that are critical to transportability. We describe the parsing system, which is a completely independent module that has been interfaced to a variety of different applications, and then discuss the other modules which bridge the gap between the parser and the dbms.},

The 2-Poisson (TP) model which was proposed as a model of how the occurrence frequency of specialty words in a collection is distributed, has since been used to develop retrieval strategies that incorporate term frequency information. This work investigates the use of the TP model, in this context, further. It is shown that the search effectiveness, when no relevance information is assumed, can be further enhanced by using this model. Furthermore, when the term weights proposed in this work are used in conjunction with weights known as term significance weights, the results are very encouraging.},

abstract = {The early work on the probabilistic models of retrieval assumed that the document representation is binary, indicating only the presence or absence of index terms. The 2-Poisson (TP) model which was proposed as a model of how the occurrence frequency of specialty words in a collection is distributed, has since been used to develop retrieval strategies that incorporate term frequency information. This work investigates the use of the TP model, in this context, further. It is shown that the search effectiveness, when no relevance information is assumed, can be further enhanced by using this model. Furthermore, when the term weights proposed in this work are used in conjunction with weights known as term significance weights, the results are very encouraging.},

abstract = {Underlying many of the probabilistic models for information retrieval are assumptions of stochastic dependence or independence of varying degrees of severity for the index terms describing the documents. These models generally specify a matching function, that is a function which compares a query with each document. The form of that function is to a large extent determined by the particular dependence/independence assumption. For example, if the index terms are assumed to be independently distributed over both the set of relevant and non-relevant documents then the matching function will in general be linear, whereas an assumption of dependence will lead to a non-linear function.Irrespective of the form that the matching function may take it is always assumed that the search terms in the query are known. In this paper I wish to address the problem of the choice of search terms and how this choice may be affected by an independence assumption.},

We tried two experiments, one using an on-line library catalog and the other an on-line news wire.

In the second, news wire users could read Associated Press news stories either by posting a keyword profile against which all stories were matched, or by selecting them from a menu of current news items. For the library users, keyword searches were clearly preferred, by votes of 3 and 4 to 1; for the news stories, retrieval by keyword search is 50% less common than menu choice.We suggest that the difference is based on the degree of user foreknowledge of the data base and its organization. Menu-type interfaces tell the user what is available. If the user already knows, as in the library where a majority of the users have a particular book in mind, then the menu is merely time-consuming.

The study characterizes user behavior in terms of types of searches done, patterns of use, time spent on searching, errors, and system problems. Preliminary results suggest that users have much shorter sessions than on other types of retrieval systems.

To our knowledge, this is the first monitoring study of an online catalog performed without system-defined user sessions. Online catalogs represent a class of retrieval systems which are designed for end users, require little or no formal training, and replace an existing manual system. The study characterizes user behavior in terms of types of searches done, patterns of use, time spent on searching, errors, and system problems. Preliminary results suggest that users have much shorter sessions than on other types of retrieval systems. Patterns of use vary between campus libraries, academic quarters, and between short and long sessions. Results of the study will be applied to improving the user interface and other system features.},
