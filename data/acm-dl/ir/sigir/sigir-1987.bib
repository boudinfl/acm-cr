In this approach the assumption that term (or atomic) vectors are pairwise orthogonal is not required. In addition, it provides a natural and consistent interpretation of term occurrence frequencies obtained from autoindexing.},

abstract = {The effect of probabilistic search term weighting on the improvement of retrieval quality has been demonstrated in various experiments described in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of this method for boolean retrieval with terms from a prescribed indexing vocabulary. This is a quite different test setting in comparison to other experiments where linear retrieval with free text terms was used. The experimental results show that in our case no improvement over a simple coordination match function can be achieved. On the other hand, models based on probabilistic indexing outperform the ranking procedures using search term weights.},

abstract = {An optimal query has been defined as one which will recover all the known relevant documents of a query in their best probability of relevance ranking. We have slightly modified the definition so that it also allows one to trace its evolution from the original to the optimal via the various feedback stages. Such a query can be constructed by modifying the original query with terms from the known relevant documents. It is pointed out that such a term addition strategy differs materially from other approaches that add terms based on term association with all query terms, and calculated from the whole document collection. The effect of viewing a document as constituted of components, and hence affecting the weighting and retreival results of of the optimal query, is also discussed.},

abstract = {Document retrieval systems have been restricted, by the nature of the task, to techniques that can be used with large numbers of documents and broad domains. The most effective techniques that have been developed are based on the statistics of word occurrences in text. In this paper, we describe an approach to using natural language processing (NLP) techniques for what is essentially a natural language problem - the comparison of a request text with the text of document titles and abstracts. The proposed NLP techniques are used to develop a request model based on “conceptual case frames” and to compare this model with the texts of candidate documents. The request model is also used to provide information to statistical search techniques that identify the candidate documents. As part of a preliminary evaluation of this approach, case frame representations of a set of requests from the CACM collection were constructed. Statistical searches carried out using dependency and relative importance information derived from the request models indicate that performance benefits can be obtained.},

We find a wide range of skills in ability to use these systems; this diverse population must be accommodated by the next generation of systems. This paper reports on a study to identify variables related to information retrieval aptitude, based on results from earlier studies of searchers and programmers. A sample of undergraduate subjects from English, psychology, and engineering majors was given a series of psychometric tests and compared to known populations. We find that engineering majors exhibit academic background and personality characteristics most like those of skilled searchers and programmers, with contrasting patterns or no discernible patterns in English and psychology majors. The strength of most associations increases when restricted to subjects who have either stayed in one major or who have changed major only within one disciplinary area. About half the variance in choice of major can be explained by scores on the tests administered, and a comparable amount of variance in test scores can be explained by the academic background variables.},

Additionally, the joint access probabilities of the objects are unknown. The intention is that the objects accessed more frequently together are located in the same class. This problem has been shown to be NP-hard [15, 16]. In this paper, we propose two stochastic learning automata solutions to the problem. Although the first one is relatively fast, its accuracy is not so remarkable in some environments. The second solution, which uses a new variable structure stochastic automation, demonstrates an excellent partitioning capability. Experimentally, this solution converges an order of magnitude faster than the best known algorithm in the literature [15, 16].},

The documents in the model are represented by relations. An algebra for handling documents of one type can be extended to an algebra for handling documents of several types. Further, an algebra for handling documents can be extended by the relational algebra for handling documents and relations in a common algebra. The model of this paper can be regarded as a part of a general document model. On the other hand, unstructured documents themselves are an important group of documents. We will show by examples that the simple model covers a wide range of document handling and information retrieval problems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a functional description of a VLSI chip aimed at reducing the cost of data transmission and data access within information processing machines and distributed information systems. The chip maps standard character codes (e.g., ASCII) into more efficient codes (e.g., Huffman's codes) using a tree module of basic cells. In bit-serial communication controllers, for example, the parallel-to-serial transformation unit can be simply replaced by the proposed chip. The VLSI design can provide speeds that far exceed current and projected peak transfer rates of high-speed disks and communication controllers.},

abstract = {Queries to information retrieval systems are often incrementally specified as a result of user interaction with the system. However, most discussions of file organizations consider only completely specified queries. The choice of file organizations to support such incremental specification is discussed qualitatively in this extended abstract. (Quantitative comparisons are partially complete and are not presented here.) Organizations which are advantageous for completely specified queries are not necessarily so for incrementally specified queries (and vice versa).},

abstract = {The knowledge of a short substring constitutes a good basis for guessing the next character in a natural language text. This observation, i.e. repeated guessing and encoding of subsequent characters, is very fundamental for the predictive text compression. The paper describes a family of such compression methods, using a hash table for searching the prediction information. The experiments show that the methods produce good compression gains and, moreover, are very fast. The one-pass versions are especially apt for “on-the-fly” compression of transmitted data, and could be a basis for specialized hardware.},

abstract = {This paper outlines a problem in commercial online retrieval systems, provides a review of the relevant literature, and presents a solution for a special case of the problem. Previous investigators have considered how to best determine, for a ranked list of records retrieved from an online retrieval system, whether or not the user should continue to display the output. This paper examines the problem of how effective display size can be estimated as a means of assisting the users of commercial online retrieval systems. Although no experimental results are as yet available, the approach presented here will provide a guide to and prolegomenon for systematic study of the problem, as well as a method for providing the estimated number of relevant records remaining in a retrieved set ranked by a retrieval status value.},

This system combines artificial intelligence and human factors engineering techniques, allowing us to redesign traditional bibliographic information retrieval interfaces.
