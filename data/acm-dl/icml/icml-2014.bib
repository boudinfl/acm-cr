publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {A mean function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), or a kernel mean, is an important part of many algorithms ranging from kernel principal component analysis to Hilbert-space embedding of distributions. Given a finite sample, an empirical average is the standard estimate for the true kernel mean. We show that this estimator can be improved due to a well-known phenomenon in statistics called Stein's phenomenon. After consideration, our theoretical analysis reveals the existence of a wide class of estimators that are better than the standard one. Focusing on a subset of this class, we propose efficient shrinkage estimators for the kernel mean. Empirical evaluations on several applications clearly demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the standard kernel mean estimator.},

abstract = {We propose a novel method for clustering data which is grounded in information-theoretic principles and requires no parametric assumptions. Previous attempts to use information theory to define clusters in an assumption-free way are based on maximizing mutual information between data and cluster labels. We demonstrate that this intuition suffers from a fundamental conceptual flaw that causes clustering performance to deteriorate as the amount of data increases. Instead, we return to the axiomatic foundations of information theory to define a meaningful clustering measure based on the notion of consistency under coarse-graining for finite data.},

abstract = {The difficulty of POMDP planning depends on the size of the search space involved. Heuristics are often used to reduce the search space size and improve computational efficiency; however, there are few theoretical bounds on their effectiveness.

With insights from the theoretical analysis, we have developed a practical POMDP algorithm, Packing-Guided Value Iteration (PGVI). Empirically, PGVI is competitive with the state-of-the-art point-based POMDP algorithms on 65 small benchmark problems and outperforms them on 4 larger problems.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {A prediction rule in binary classification that aims to achieve the lowest probability of misclassification involves minimizing over a nonconvex, 0-1 loss function, which is typically a computationally intractable optimization problem. To address the intractability, previous methods consider minimizing the cumulative loss - the sum of convex surrogates of the 0-1 loss of each sample. We revisit this paradigm and develop instead an axiomatic framework by proposing a set of salient properties on functions for binary classification and then propose the coherent loss approach, which is a tractable upper-bound of the empirical classification error over the entire sample set. We show that the proposed approach yields a strictly tighter approximation to the empirical classification error than any convex cumulative loss approach while preserving the convexity of the underlying optimization problem, and this approach for binary classification also has a robustness interpretation which builds a connection to robust SVMs.},

This matches the convergence rate of the batch ADMM algorithm, but without the need to visit all the samples in each iteration. Experiments on the graph-guided fused lasso demonstrate that the new algorithm is significantly faster than state-of-the-art stochastic and batch ADMM algorithms.},

title = {Active Detection via Adaptive Submodularity},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Efficient detection of multiple object instances is one of the fundamental challenges in computer vision. For certain object categories, even the best automatic systems are yet unable to produce high-quality detection results, and fully manual annotation would be an expensive process. How can detection algorithms interplay with human expert annotators? To make the best use of scarce (human) labeling resources, one needs to decide when to invoke the expert, such that the best possible performance can be achieved while requiring a minimum amount of supervision.In this paper, we propose a principled approach to active object detection, and show that for a rich class of base detectors algorithms, one can derive a natural sequential decision problem for deciding when to invoke expert supervision. We further show that the objective function satisfies adaptive submodularity, which allows us to derive strong performance guarantees for our algorithm. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three real-world tasks, including a problem for biodiversity monitoring from micro UAVs in the Sumatra rain forest. Our results show that active detection not only outperforms its passive counterpart; for certain tasks, it also works significantly better than straightforward application of existing active learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to rigorously address the active detection problem from both empirical and theoretical perspectives.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We first propose an adaptive accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method for minimizing strongly convex composite functions with unknown convexity parameters. This method incorporates a restarting scheme to automatically estimate the strong convexity parameter and achieves a nearly optimal iteration complexity. Then we consider the l1-regularized least-squares (l1-LS) problem in the high-dimensional setting. Although such an objective function is not strongly convex, it has restricted strong convexity over sparse vectors. We exploit this property by combining the adaptive APG method with a homotopy continuation scheme, which generates a sparse solution path towards optimality. This method obtains a global linear rate of convergence and its overall iteration complexity has a weaker dependency on the restricted condition number than previous work.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The goal of the scene labeling task is to assign a class label to each pixel in an image. To ensure a good visual coherence and a high class accuracy, it is essential for a model to capture long range (pixel) label dependencies in images. In a feed-forward architecture, this can be achieved simply by considering a sufficiently large input context patch, around each pixel to be labeled. We propose an approach that consists of a recurrent convolutional neural network which allows us to consider a large input context while limiting the capacity of the model. Contrary to most standard approaches, our method does not rely on any segmentation technique nor any task-specific features. The system is trained in an end-to-end manner over raw pixels, and models complex spatial dependencies with low inference cost. As the context size increases with the built-in recurrence, the system identifies and corrects its own errors. Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on both the Stanford Background Dataset and the SIFT Flow Dataset, while remaining very fast at test time.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {One popular method for dealing with large-scale data sets is sampling. Using the empirical statistical leverage scores as an importance sampling distribution, the method of algorithmic leveraging samples and rescales data matrices to reduce the data size before performing computations on the subproblem. Existing work has focused on algorithmic issues, but none of it addresses statistical aspects of this method. Here, we provide an effective framework to evaluate the statistical properties of algorithmic leveraging in the context of estimating parameters in a linear regression model. In particular, for several versions of leverage-based sampling, we derive results for the bias and variance. We show that from the statistical perspective of bias and variance, neither leverage-based sampling nor uniform sampling dominates the other. This result is particularly striking, given the well-known result that, from the algorithmic perspective of worst-case analysis, leverage-based sampling provides uniformly superior worst-case algorithmic results, when compared with uniform sampling. Based on these theoretical results, we propose and analyze two new leveraging algorithms: one constructs a smaller least-squares problem with "shrinked" leverage scores (SLEV), and the other solves a smaller and unweighted (or biased) least-squares problem (LEVUNW). The empirical results indicate that our theory is a good predictor of practical performance of existing and new leverage-based algorithms and that the new algorithms achieve improved performance.},

title = {Thompson Sampling for Complex Online Problems},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with complex actions over a set of basic arms, where the decision maker plays a complex action rather than a basic arm in each round. The reward of the complex action is some function of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the reward perarm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space without additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets. Using particle filters for computing posterior distributions which lack an explicit closed-form, we present numerical results for the performance of Thompson sampling for subset-selection and job scheduling problems.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Multi-step forecasts can be produced recursively by iterating a one-step model, or directly using a specific model for each horizon. Choosing between these two strategies is not an easy task since it involves a trade-off between bias and estimation variance over the forecast horizon. Using a nonlinear machine learning model makes the tradeoff even more difficult. To address this issue, we propose a new forecasting strategy which boosts traditional recursive linear forecasts with a direct strategy using a boosting autoregression procedure at each horizon. First, we investigate the performance of the proposed strategy in terms of bias and variance decomposition of the error using simulated time series. Then, we evaluate the proposed strategy on real-world time series from two forecasting competitions. Overall, we obtain excellent performance with respect to the standard forecasting strategies.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {There has been much interest recently in the problem of rank aggregation from pairwise data. A natural question that arises is: under what sorts of statistical assumptions do various rank aggregation algorithms converge to an 'optimal' ranking? In this paper, we consider this question in a natural setting where pairwise comparisons are drawn randomly and independently from some underlying probability distribution. We first show that, under a 'time-reversibility' or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) condition on the distribution, the rank centrality (PageRank) and least squares (HodgeRank) algorithms both converge to an optimal ranking. Next, we show that a matrix version of the Borda count algorithm, and more surprisingly, an algorithm which performs maximum likelihood estimation under a BTL assumption, both converge to an optimal ranking under a 'low-noise' condition that is strictly more general than BTL. Finally, we propose a new SVM-based algorithm for rank aggregation from pairwise data, and show that this converges to an optimal ranking under an even more general condition that we term 'generalized low-noise'. In all cases, we provide explicit sample complexity bounds for exact recovery of an optimal ranking. Our experiments confirm our theoretical findings and help to shed light on the statistical behavior of various rank aggregation algorithms.},

Our experimental results in an optimal replacement task and a complex inventory management task demonstrate the potential for options to speed up convergence in practice. We show that options induce faster convergence to the optimal value function, which implies deriving better policies with fewer iterations.},

This allocation mechanism enables a fast variational inference procedure for learning of the inducing inputs and hyperparameters of the experts.

Furthermore, it is easy to parallelize and handles nonstationarity straightforwardly. Our experiments show that on medium-sized datasets (of around 104 training points) it trains up to 5 times faster than FITC while achieving comparable accuracy.

This paper seeks to address this gap, by providing a systematic analysis of factors which characterize the LDA's performance. We present theorems elucidating the posterior contraction rates of the topics as the amount of data increases, and a thorough supporting empirical study using synthetic and real data sets, including news and web-based articles and tweet messages. Based on these results we provide practical guidance on how to identify suitable data sets for topic models, and how to specify particular model parameters.},

While effective, MNIR has no way to exploit structure in the corpus to improve its predictions or facilitate exploratory data analysis. On the other hand, traditional probabilistic topic models (like latent Dirichlet allocation) capture natural heterogeneity in a collection but do not account for external variables. In this paper, we introduce the inverse regression topic model (IRTM), a mixed-membership extension of MNIR that combines the strengths of both methodologies. We present two inference algorithms for the IRTM: an efficient batch estimation algorithm and an online variant, which is suitable for large corpora. We apply these methods to a corpus of 73K Congressional press releases and another of 150K Yelp reviews, demonstrating that the IRTM outperforms both MNIR and supervised topic models on the prediction task. Further, we give examples showing that the IRTM enables systematic discovery of in-topic lexical variation, which is not possible with previous supervised topic models.},

abstract = {Bundle discounts are used by retailers in many industries. Optimal bundle pricing requires learning the joint distribution of consumer valuations for the items in the bundle, that is, how much they are willing to pay for each of the items. We suppose that a retailer has sales transaction data, and the corresponding consumer valuations are latent variables. We develop a statistically consistent and computationally tractable inference procedure for fitting a copula model over correlated valuations, using only sales transaction data for the individual items. Simulations and data experiments demonstrate consistency, scalability, and the importance of incorporating correlations in the joint distribution.},

title = {Towards Minimax Online Learning with Unknown Time Horizon},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We consider online learning when the time horizon is unknown. We apply a minimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to two unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly according to some distribution, and the other which allows the adversary full control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted losses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial horizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the adversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known. Based on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a new adaptive algorithm which "pretends" that the horizon is drawn from a distribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is chosen, the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our algorithm can be combined and applied in many ways, for instance, to online convex optimization, follow the perturbed leader, exponential weights algorithm and first order bounds. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms many other existing algorithms in an online linear optimization setting.},

abstract = {We develop a machine learning approach to represent and analyze the underlying spatial structure that governs shot selection among professional basketball players in the NBA. Typically, NBA players are discussed and compared in an heuristic, imprecise manner that relies on unmeasured intuitions about player behavior. This makes it difficult to draw comparisons between players and make accurate player specific predictions. Modeling shot attempt data as a point process, we create a low dimensional representation of offensive player types in the NBA. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, we show that a low-rank spatial decomposition summarizes the shooting habits of NBA players. The spatial representations discovered by the algorithm correspond to intuitive descriptions of NBA player types, and can be used to model other spatial effects, such as shooting accuracy.},

We derive an accelerated smoothed algorithm with a convergence rate of √log n/ρ given n separable points, which is strikingly similar to the classical kernelized Perceptron algorithm whose rate is 1/ρ2. When no such classifier exists, we prove a version of Gordan's separation theorem for RKHSs, and give a reinterpretation of negative margins. This allows us to give guarantees for a primal-dual algorithm that halts in min{√n/|ρ|,√n/ε} iterations with a perfect separator in the RKHS if the primal is feasible or a dual ε-certificate of near-infeasibility.},

We apply our approach to latent topic modeling tasks and demonstrate that by combining FOL knowledge and Bayesian modeling, we both improve the task performance and discover more structured latent representations in unsupervised and supervised learning.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In recent years, a number of probabilistic inference and counting techniques have been proposed that exploit pairwise independent hash functions to infer properties of succinctly defined high-dimensional sets. While providing desirable statistical guarantees, typical constructions of such hash functions are themselves not amenable to efficient inference. Inspired by the success of LDPC codes, we propose the use of low-density parity constraints to make inference more tractable in practice. While not strongly universal, we show that such sparse constraints belong to a new class of hash functions that we call Average Universal. These weaker hash functions retain the desirable statistical guarantees needed by most such probabilistic inference methods. Thus, they continue to provide provable accuracy guarantees while at the same time making a number of algorithms significantly more scalable in practice. Using this technique, we provide new, tighter bounds for challenging discrete integration and model counting problems.},

The second problem, the multiarmed bandit with paid observations, is a variant of the adversarial N-armed bandit game, where on round t of the game we can observe the reward of any number of arms, but each observation has a cost c. We present an algorithm that achieves O((cN lnN)1/3 T2/3 + √T lnN) regret on T rounds of this game in the worst case. Furthermore, we present a number of refinements that treat arm- and time-dependent observation costs and achieve lower regret under benign conditions.

The proposed model possesses properties that link the nested Dirichlet processes (nDP) and the Dirichlet process mixture models (DPM) in an interesting way: integrating out all contents results in the DPM over contexts, whereas integrating out group-specific contexts results in the nDP mixture over content variables.

This is done in a supervised way by assuming the availability of several (partially) labeled datasets that share the same metric. We cast the metric learning problem as a large-margin structured prediction problem, with proper definition of regularizers and losses, leading to a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently.

By using the theory of Gibbs classifiers and data augmentation, we develop efficient beam sampling algorithms without making restricting mean-field assumptions or truncated approximation. For single variate classification, M2iHMMs reduce to a new formulation of DP mixtures of max-margin machines. Empirical results on synthetic and real data sets show that our methods obtain superior performance than other competitors in both single variate classification and sequential prediction tasks.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Model selection is one of the key issues both in recent research and application of kernel methods. Cross-validation is a commonly employed and widely accepted model selection criterion. However, it requires multiple times of training the algorithm under consideration, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for approximating the cross-validation based on the Bouligand influence function (BIF), which only requires the solution of the algorithm once. The BIF measures the impact of an infinitesimal small amount of contamination of the original distribution. We first establish the link between the concept of BIF and the concept of cross-validation. The BIF is related to the first order term of a Taylor expansion. Then, we calculate the BIF and higher order BIFs, and apply these theoretical results to approximate the cross-validation error in practice. Experimental results demonstrate that our approximate cross-validation criterion is sound and efficient.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of online multiclass prediction in the bandit setting. Compared with the full-information setting, in which the learner can receive the true label as feedback after making each prediction, the bandit setting assumes that the learner can only know the correctness of the predicted label. Because the bandit setting is more restricted, it is difficult to design good bandit learners and currently there are not many bandit learners. In this paper, we propose an approach that systematically converts existing online binary classifiers to promising bandit learners with strong theoretical guarantee. The approach matches the idea of boosting, which has been shown to be powerful for batch learning as well as online learning. In particular, we establish the weak-learning condition on the online binary classifier, and show that the condition allows automatically constructing a bandit learner with arbitrary strength by combining several of those classifiers. Experimental results on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Our framework includes Alon et al.'s model, even with a competitor and with cost. We then give a (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm for this more general problem. Furthermore, when influence probabilities are nonincreasing, we obtain a faster (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm, which runs essentially in linear time in the number of nodes. This allows us to implement our algorithm up to almost 10M edges (indeed, our experiments tell us that we can implement our algorithm up to 1 billion edges.

This adaptive subsampling technique is an alternative to the recent approach developed in (Korattikara et al., 2014), and it allows us to establish rigorously that the resulting approximate MH algorithm samples from a perturbed version of the target distribution of interest, whose total variation distance to this very target is controlled explicitly.

The goal is to design a strategy for evaluating the function incurring little cost (in the worst case or in expectation according to a prior distribution on the possible variables' assignments).Our algorithm builds a strategy (decision tree) which attains a logarithmic approximation simultaneously for the expected and worst cost spent.

abstract = {Different real-world applications of multilabel classification often demand different evaluation criteria. We formalize this demand with a general setup, cost-sensitive multi-label classification (CSMLC), which takes the evaluation criteria into account during learning. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms can only focus on optimizing a few specific evaluation criteria, and cannot systematically deal with different ones. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called condensed filter tree (CFT), for optimizing any criteria in CSMLC. CFT is derived from reducing CSMLC to the famous filter tree algorithm for cost-sensitive multi-class classification via constructing the label powerset. We successfully cope with the difficulty of having exponentially many extended-classes within the powerset for representation, training and prediction by carefully designing the tree structure and focusing on the key nodes. Experimental results across many real-world datasets validate that CFT is competitive with special purpose algorithms on special criteria and reaches better performance on general criteria.},

More efficient algorithms use sequential sampling strategies based on the expected value of low dimensional MAP perturbations. This paper develops new measure concentration inequalities that bound the number of samples needed to estimate such expected values. Applying the general result to MAP perturbations can yield a more efficient algorithm to approximate sampling from the Gibbs distribution. The measure concentration result is of general interest and may be applicable to other areas involving Monte Carlo estimation of expectations.},

abstract = {We show that several popular discounted reward natural actor-critics, including the popular NAC-LSTD and eNAC algorithms, do not generate unbiased estimates of the natural policy gradient as claimed. We derive the first unbiased discounted reward natural actor-critics using batch and iterative approaches to gradient estimation. We argue that the bias makes the existing algorithms more appropriate for the average reward setting. We also show that, when Sarsa(λ) is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy, the objective function used by natural actor-critics has only global optima, so policy gradient methods are guaranteed to converge to globally optimal policies as well.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Learning probabilistic models over strings is an important issue for many applications. Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings drawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular value decomposition of a matrix HS, called the Hankel matrix, that records the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in HS and on the distance between HS and its mean Hr. Existing concentration bounds seem to indicate that the concentration over Hr gets looser with its size, suggesting to make a tradeoff between the quantity of used information and the size of Hr. We propose new dimension-free concentration bounds for several variants of Hankel matrices. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds are tight and that they significantly improve existing bounds. These results suggest that the concentration rate of the Hankel matrix around its mean does not constitute an argument for limiting its size.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Probabilistic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) discover latent topics from large corpora by exploiting words' co-occurring relation. By observing the topical similarity between words, we find that some other relations, such as semantic or syntax relation between words, lead to strong dependence between their topics. In this paper, sentences are represented as dependency trees and a Global Topic Random Field (GTRF) is presented to model the nonlinear dependencies between words. To infer our model, a new global factor is defined over all edges and the normalization factor of GRF is proven to be a constant. As a result, no independent assumption is needed when inferring our model. Based on it, we develop an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) procedure for parameter estimation. Experimental results on four data sets show that GTRF achieves much lower perplexity than LDA and linear dependency topic models and produces better topic coherence.},

These models use a fixed, arbitrary ordering of the data dimensions. One can easily condition on variables at the beginning of the ordering, and marginalize out variables at the end of the ordering, however other inference tasks require approximate inference. In this work we introduce an efficient procedure to simultaneously train a NADE model for each possible ordering of the variables, by sharing parameters across all these models. We can thus use the most convenient model for each inference task at hand, and ensembles of such models with different orderings are immediately available. Moreover, unlike the original NADE, our training procedure scales to deep models. Empirically, ensembles of Deep NADE models obtain state of the art density estimation performance.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of differentially private risk minimization where the goal is to provide differentially private algorithms that have small excess risk. In particular we address the following open problem: Is it possible to design computationally efficient differentially private risk minimizers with excess risk bounds that do not explicitly depend on dimensionality (p) and do not require structural assumptions like restricted strong convexity?In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative for a variant of the well-known output and objective perturbation algorithms (Chaudhuri et al., 2011). In particular, we show that under certain assumptions, variants of both output and objective perturbation algorithms have no explicit dependence on p; the excess risk depends only on the L2-norm of the true risk minimizer and that of training points.Next, we present a novel privacy preserving algorithm for risk minimization over simplex in the generalized linear model, where the loss function is a doubly differentiable convex function. Assuming that the training points have bounded L∞-norm, our algorithm provides risk bound that has only logarithmic dependence on p. We also apply our technique to the online learning setting and obtain a regret bound with similar logarithmic dependence on p. In contrast, the existing differentially private online learning methods incur O(√p) dependence.},

In this paper, we propose to use Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approximations instead where the relevant integrands are evaluated on a low-discrepancy sequence of points as opposed to random point sets as in the Monte Carlo approach. We derive a new discrepancy measure called box discrepancy based on theoretical characterizations of the integration error with respect to a given sequence. We then propose to learn QMC sequences adapted to our setting based on explicit box discrepancy minimization. Our theoretical analyses are complemented with empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of classical and adaptive QMC techniques for this problem.},

abstract = {We consider forward-backward greedy algorithms for solving sparse feature selection problems with general convex smooth functions. A state-of-the-art greedy method, the Forward-Backward greedy algorithm (FoBa-obj) requires to solve a large number of optimization problems, thus it is not scalable for large-size problems. The FoBa-gdt algorithm, which uses the gradient information for feature selection at each forward iteration, significantly improves the efficiency of FoBa-obj. In this paper, we systematically analyze the theoretical properties of both algorithms. Our main contributions are: 1) We derive better theoretical bounds than existing analyses regarding FoBa-obj for general smooth convex functions; 2) We show that FoBagdt achieves the same theoretical performance as FoBa-obj under the same condition: restricted strong convexity condition. Our new bounds are consistent with the bounds of a special case (least squares) and fills a previously existing theoretical gap for general convex smooth functions; 3) We show that the restricted strong convexity condition is satisfied if the number of independent samples is more than k log d where k is the sparsity number and d is the dimension of the variable; 4)We apply FoBa-gdt (with the conditional random field objective) to the sensor selection problem for human indoor activity recognition and our results show that FoBa-gdt outperforms other methods based on forward greedy selection and L1-regularization.},

We provide a rigorous complexity analysis of these techniques, while providing near-optimal regret-bounds (in particular, we take into account the computational costs of performing approximate projections in MD2). In the case of full-information feedback, our results complement existing ones.

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We consider stochastic multi-armed bandits where the expected reward is a unimodal function over partially ordered arms. This important class of problems has been recently investigated in (Cope, 2009; Yu &amp; Mannor, 2011). The set of arms is either discrete, in which case arms correspond to the vertices of a finite graph whose structure represents similarity in rewards, or continuous, in which case arms belong to a bounded interval. For discrete unimodal bandits, we derive asymptotic lower bounds for the regret achieved under any algorithm, and propose OSUB, an algorithm whose regret matches this lower bound. Our algorithm optimally exploits the unimodal structure of the problem, and surprisingly, its asymptotic regret does not depend on the number of arms. We also provide a regret upper bound for OSUB in nonstationary environments where the expected rewards smoothly evolve over time. The analytical results are supported by numerical experiments showing that OSUB performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms. For continuous sets of arms, we provide a brief discussion. We show that combining an appropriate discretization of the set of arms with the UCB algorithm yields an order-optimal regret, and in practice, outperforms recently proposed algorithms designed to exploit the unimodal structure.},

In this paper we investigate the use of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for estimating such ratios.First, we theoretically analyze the MMD-based estimates. Our analysis establishes that, under some mild conditions, the estimate is statistically consistent. More importantly, it provides an upper bound on the error in the estimate in terms of intuitive geometric quantities like class separation and data spread. Next, we use the insights obtained from the theoretical analysis, to propose a novel convex formulation that automatically learns the kernel to be employed in the MMD-based estimation. We design an efficient cutting plane algorithm for solving this formulation. Finally, we empirically compare our estimator with several existing methods, and show significantly improved performance under varying datasets, class ratios, and training sizes.},

abstract = {The problem of change point estimation is considered in a general framework where the data are generated by arbitrary unknown stationary ergodic process distributions. This means that the data may have long-range dependencies of an arbitrary form. In this context the consistent estimation of the number of change points is provably impossible. A formulation is proposed which overcomes this obstacle: it is possible to find the correct number of change points at the expense of introducing the additional constraint that the correct number of process distributions that generate the data is provided. This additional parameter has a natural interpretation in many real-world applications. It turns out that in this formulation change point estimation can be reduced to time series clustering. Based on this reduction, an algorithm is proposed that finds the number of change points and locates the changes. This algorithm is shown to be asymptotically consistent. The theoretical results are complemented with empirical evaluations.},

Unfortunately, such optimization is hard since simple operations on orthogonal matrices easily break orthogonality, and correcting orthogonality usually costs a large amount of computation.Here we propose a framework for optimizing orthogonal matrices, that is the parallel of coordinate-descent in Euclidean spaces. It is based on Givens-rotations, a fast-to-compute operation that affects a small number of entries in the learned matrix, and preserves orthogonality.We show two applications of this approach: an algorithm for tensor decompositions used in learning mixture models, and an algorithm for sparse-PCA. We study the parameter regime where a Givens rotation approach converges faster and achieves a superior model on a genome-wide brain-wide mRNA expression dataset.},

title = {Densifying One Permutation Hashing via Rotation for Fast near Neighbor Search},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The query complexity of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based similarity search is dominated by the number of hash evaluations, and this number grows with the data size (Indyk &amp; Motwani, 1998). In industrial applications such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and binary (e.g., text n-grams), minwise hashing is widely adopted, which requires applying a large number of permutations on the data. This is costly in computation and energy-consumption.In this paper, we propose a hashing technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations needed for similarity search, using one single permutation. The heart of the proposed hash function is a "rotation" scheme which densifies the sparse sketches of one permutation hashing (Li et al., 2012) in an unbiased fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of independent interest for densifying other types of sparse sketches.Using our proposed hashing method, the query time of a (K,L)-parameterized LSH is reduced from the typical O(dKL) complexity to merely O(KL + dL), where d is the number of nonzeros of the data vector, K is the number of hashes in each hash table, and L is the number of hash tables. Our experimental evaluation on real data confirms that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the query processing time over minwise hashing without loss in retrieval accuracies.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The kernel support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used classification methods; however, the amount of computation required becomes the bottleneck when facing millions of samples. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the division step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by clustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and efficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the subproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM problem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel clustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are used to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly as suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel Divide-and-Conquer SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction strategy, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training speed, testing accuracy, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in obtaining the exact SVM solution (to within 10-6 relative error) which achieves 96.15% prediction accuracy. Moreover, with our proposed early prediction strategy, DC-SVM achieves about 96% accuracy in only 12 minutes, which is more than 100 times faster than LIBSVM.},

abstract = {The multi-label classification problem has generated significant interest in recent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key challenges: (a) scaling up to problems with a large number (say millions) of labels, and (b) handling data with missing labels. In this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to obtain efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive) Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform significantly better than existing label compression based methods and can scale up to very large datasets such as a Wikipedia dataset that has more than 200,000 labels.},

By a "hub-networked" graph, we mean a graph with a few "hub nodes" with very large degrees. State of the art estimators for Ising models have a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the maximum node-degree, and are thus ill-suited to recovering such graphs with a few hub nodes. Some recent proposals for specifically recovering hub graphical models do not come with theoretical guarantees, and even empirically provide limited improvements over vanilla Ising model estimators. Here, we show that under such low sample settings, instead of estimating "difficult" components such as hub-neighborhoods, we can use quantitative indicators of our inability to do so, and thereby identify hub-nodes. This simple procedure allows us to recover hub-networked graphs with very strong statistical guarantees even under very low sample settings.},

This approach uses a prior directly on the performance of predictors taken from a finite set of candidates and attempts to infer which one is best. Using Bayesian inference, we can thus obtain a posterior that represents our uncertainty about that choice and construct a weighted ensemble of predictors accordingly. This approach has the advantage of not requiring that the predictors be probabilistic themselves, can deal with arbitrary measures of performance and does not assume that the data was actually generated from any of the predictors in the ensemble. Since the problem of finding the best (as opposed to the true) predictor among a class is known as agnostic PAC-learning, we refer to our method as agnostic Bayesian learning. We also propose a method to address the case where the performance estimate is obtained from k-fold cross validation. While being efficient and easily adjustable to any loss function, our experiments confirm that the agnostic Bayes approach is state of the art compared to common baselines such as model selection based on k-fold crossvalidation or a learned linear combination of predictor outputs.},

Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling algorithms. For such problems, we propose a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that provides a general and computationally efficient framework for handling boundary conditions. Our method first maps the D-dimensional constrained domain of parameters to the unit ball B0D (1), then augments it to a D-dimensional sphere SD such that the original boundary corresponds to the equator of SD. This way, our method handles the constraints implicitly by moving freely on the sphere generating proposals that remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space.},

abstract = {Many problems of practical interest rely on Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) defined over combinatorial state spaces, rendering the computation of transition probabilities, and hence probabilistic inference, difficult or impossible with existing methods. For problems with countably infinite states, where classical methods such as matrix exponentiation are not applicable, the main alternative has been particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods imputing both the holding times and sequences of visited states. We propose a particle-based Monte Carlo approach where the holding times are marginalized analytically. We demonstrate that in a range of realistic inferential setups, our scheme dramatically reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo approximation and yields more accurate parameter posterior approximations given a fixed computational budget. These experiments are performed on both synthetic and real datasets, drawing from two important examples of CTMCs having combinatorial state spaces: string-valued mutation models in phylogenetics and nucleic acid folding pathways.},

abstract = {In many high-dimensional learning problems, only some parts of an observation are important to the prediction task; for example, the cues to correctly categorizing a document may lie in a handful of its sentences. We introduce a learning algorithm that exploits this intuition by encoding it in a regularizer. Specifically, we apply the sparse overlapping group lasso with one group for every bundle of features occurring together in a training-data sentence, leading to thousands to millions of overlapping groups. We show how to efficiently solve the resulting optimization challenge using the alternating directions method of multipliers. We find that the resulting method significantly outperforms competitive baselines (standard ridge, lasso, and elastic net regularizers) on a suite of real-world text categorization problems.},

Here, we show that nuclear norm minimization can recover an arbitrary n\texttimes{}n matrix of rank r from O(nr log2(n)) revealed entries, provided that revealed entries are drawn proportionally to the local row and column coherences (closely related to leverage scores) of the underlying matrix. Our results are order-optimal up to logarithmic factors, and extend existing results for nuclear norm minimization which require strong incoherence conditions on the types of matrices that can be recovered, due to assumed uniformly distributed revealed entries. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that a proposed two-phase sampling algorithm can perform nearly as well as local-coherence sampling and without requiring a priori knowledge of the matrix coherence structure. Finally, we apply our results to quantify how weighted nuclear norm minimization can improve on unweighted minimization given an arbitrary set of sampled entries.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {TD(λ) is a core algorithm of modern reinforcement learning. Its appeal comes from its equivalence to a clear and conceptually simple forward view, and the fact that it can be implemented online in an inexpensive manner. However, the equivalence between TD(λ) and the forward view is exact only for the off-line version of the algorithm (in which updates are made only at the end of each episode). In the online version of TD(λ) (in which updates are made at each step, which generally performs better and is always used in applications) the match to the forward view is only approximate. In a sense this is unavoidable for the conventional forward view, as it itself presumes that the estimates are unchanging during an episode. In this paper we introduce a new forward view that takes into account the possibility of changing estimates and a new variant of TD(λ) that exactlyachieves it. Our algorithm uses a new form of eligibility trace similar to but different from conventional accumulating and replacing traces. The overall computational complexity is the same as TD(λ), even when using function approximation. In our empirical comparisons, our algorithm outperformed TD(λ) in all of its variations. It seems, by adhering more truly to the original goal of TD(λ)--matching an intuitively clear forward view even in the online case--that we have found a new algorithm that simply improves on classical TD(λ).},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The scalability of kernel machines is a big challenge when facing millions of samples due to storage and computation issues for large kernel matrices, that are usually dense. Recently, many papers have suggested tackling this problem by using a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. In this paper, we first make the observation that the structure of shift-invariant kernels changes from low-rank to block-diagonal (without any low-rank structure) when varying the scale parameter. Based on this observation, we propose a new kernel approximation algorithm - Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation (MEKA), which considers both low-rank and clustering structure of the kernel matrix. We show that the resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank kernel approximation methods in terms of speed, approximation error, and memory usage. As an example, on the mnist2m dataset with two-million samples, our method takes 550 seconds on a single machine using less than 500 MBytes memory to achieve 0.2313 test RMSE for kernel ridge regression, while standard Nystr\"{o}m approximation takes more than 2700 seconds and uses more than 2 GBytes memory on the same problem to achieve 0.2318 test RMSE.},

In contrast, most work on learning graphical models, thin junction trees, and arithmetic circuits has focused on finding direct interactions among variables. In this paper, we present ID-SPN, a new algorithm for learning SPN structure that unifies the two approaches.

abstract = {Predicting protein secondary structure is a fundamental problem in protein structure prediction. Here we present a new supervised generative stochastic network (GSN) based method to predict local secondary structure with deep hierarchical representations. GSN is a recently proposed deep learning technique (Bengio &amp; Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013) to globally train deep generative model. We present the supervised extension of GSN, which learns a Markov chain to sample from a conditional distribution, and applied it to protein structure prediction. To scale the model to full-sized, high-dimensional data, like protein sequences with hundreds of aminoacids, we introduce a convolutional architecture, which allows efficient learning across multiple layers of hierarchical representations. Our architecture uniquely focuses on predicting structured low-level labels informed with both low and high-level representations learned by the model. In our application this corresponds to labeling the secondary structure state of each amino-acid residue. We trained and tested the model on separate sets of non-homologous proteins sharing less than 30% sequence identity. Our model achieves 66:4% Q8 accuracy on the CB513 dataset, better than the previously reported best performance 64:9% (Wang et al., 2011) for this challenging secondary structure prediction problem.},

abstract = {The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that--even in very highdimensional cases--most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

To address this challenge, we propose compact random feature maps (CRAFTMaps) to approximate polynomial kernels more concisely and accurately. We prove the error bounds of CRAFTMaps demonstrating their superior kernel reconstruction performance compared to the previous approximation schemes. We show how structured random matrices can be used to efficiently generate CRAFTMaps, and present a single-pass algorithm using CRAFTMaps to learn non-linear multi-class classifiers.

We propose a generative RPCA model under the Bayesian framework by modeling data noise as a mixture of Gaussians (MoG). The MoG is a universal approximator to continuous distributions and thus our model is able to fit a wide range of noises such as Laplacian, Gaussian, sparse noises and any combinations of them. A variational Bayes algorithm is presented to infer the posterior of the proposed model. All involved parameters can be recursively updated in closed form. The advantage of our method is demonstrated by extensive experiments on synthetic data, face modeling and background subtraction.},

Algorithmically, we develop an accelerated variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (referred to as SDPAD-LR) that can effectively exploit the special structure of the new relaxation. Encouragingly, the proposed procedure allows solving SDR for large-scale problems, e.g., problems on a grid graph comprising hundreds of thousands of variables with multiple states per node. Compared with prior SDP solvers, SDPAD-LR is capable of attaining comparable accuracy while exhibiting remarkably improved scalability, in contrast to the commonly held belief that semidefinite relaxation can only been applied on small-scale MRF problems. We have evaluated the performance of SDR on various benchmark datasets including OPENGM2 and PIC in terms of boththe quality of the solutions and computation time. Experimental results demonstrate that for a broad class of problems, SDPAD-LR outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in producing better MAP assignments in an efficient manner.},

The most popular convex relaxation of this problem minimizes the sum of the nuclear norms (SNN) of the unfolding matrices of the tensor. We show that this approach can be substantially suboptimal: reliably recovering a K-way n\texttimes{}n\texttimes{}...\texttimes{}n tensor of Tucker rank (r, r,..., r) from Gaussian measurements requires Ω(rnK-1) observations. In contrast, a certain (intractable) nonconvex formulation needs only O(rK+nrK) observations. We introduce a simple, new convex relaxation, which partially bridges this gap. Our new formulation succeeds with O(r⌊K/2⌋n⌈K/2⌉) observations. The lower bound for the SNN model follows from our new result on recovering signals with multiple structures (e.g. sparse, low rank), which indicates the significant suboptimality of the common approach of minimizing the sum of individual sparsity inducing norms (e.g. l1, nuclear norm). Our new tractable formulation for low-rank tensor recovery shows how the sample complexity can be reduced by designing convex regularizers that exploit several structures jointly.},

abstract = {Empirical evaluation of trust and manipulation in large-scale collective intelligence processes is challenging. The datasets involved are too large for thorough manual study, and current automated options are limited. We introduce a statistical framework which classifies point of view based on user interactions. The framework works on Web-scale datasets and is applicable to a wide variety of collective intelligence processes. It enables principled study of such issues as manipulation, trustworthiness of information, and potential bias. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness in determining point of view on both synthetic data and a dataset of Wikipedia user interactions. We build a combined model of topics and points-of-view on the entire history of English Wikipedia, and show how it can be used to find potentially biased articles and visualize user interactions at a high level.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Low rank matrix completion has been applied successfully in a wide range of machine learning applications, such as collaborative filtering, image inpainting and Microarray data imputation. However, many existing algorithms are not scalable to large-scale problems, as they involve computing singular value decomposition. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable algorithm for matrix completion. The key idea is to extend the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit from the vector case to the matrix case. In each iteration, we pursue a rank-one matrix basis generated by the top singular vector pair of the current approximation residual and update the weights for all rank-one matrices obtained up to the current iteration. We further propose a novel weight updating rule to reduce the time and storage complexity, making the proposed algorithm scalable to large matrices. We establish the linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. The fast convergence is achieved due to the proposed construction of matrix bases and the estimation of the weights. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm on many real-world large-scale datasets. Results show that our algorithm is much more efficient than state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms while achieving similar or better prediction performance.},

title = {Near-Optimal Joint Object Matching via Convex Relaxation},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Joint object matching aims at aggregating information from a large collection of similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to improve the correspondences computed between pairs of objects, typically by exploiting global map compatibility. Despite some practical advances on this problem, from the theoretical point of view, the error-correction ability of existing algorithms are limited by a constant barrier -- none of them can provably recover the correct solution when more than a constant fraction of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover, prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically more demanding and realistic to match instances that are only partially similar to each other.In this paper, we propose an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that exhibit only partial similarities, where the provided pairwise feature correspondences can be densely corrupted. By encoding a consistent partial map collection into a 0-1 semidefinite matrix, we attempt recovery via a two-step procedure, that is, a spectral technique followed by a parameter-free convex program called MatchLift. Under a natural randomized model, MatchLift exhibits nearoptimal error-correction ability, i.e. it guarantees the recovery of the ground-truth maps even when a dominant fraction of the inputs are randomly corrupted. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various benchmark data sets including synthetic examples and real-world examples, all of which confirm the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {We study the total least squares (TLS) problem that generalizes least squares regression by allowing measurement errors in both dependent and independent variables. TLS is widely used in applied fields including computer vision, system identification and econometrics. The special case when all dependent and independent variables have the same level of uncorrelated Gaussian noise, known as ordinary TLS, can be solved by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, SVD cannot solve many important practical TLS problems with realistic noise structure, such as having varying measurement noise, known structure on the errors, or large outliers requiring robust error-norms. To solve such problems, we develop convex relaxation approaches for a general class of structured TLS (STLS). We show both theoretically and experimentally, that while the plain nuclear norm relaxation incurs large approximation errors for STLS, the re-weighted nuclear norm approach is very effective, and achieves better accuracy on challenging STLS problems than popular nonconvex solvers. We describe a fast solution based on augmented Lagrangian formulation, and apply our approach to an important class of biological problems that use population average measurements to infer cell-type and physiological-state specific expression levels that are very hard to measure directly.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Our objective is to develop formulations and algorithms for efficiently computing the feature selection path - i.e. the variation in classification accuracy as the fraction of selected features is varied from null to unity. Multiple Kernel Learning subject to lp≤1 regularization (lp-MKL) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective techniques for non-linear feature selection. However, state-of-the-art lp-MKL algorithms are too computationally expensive to be invoked thousands of times to determine the entire path.We propose a novel conjecture which states that, for certain lp-MKL formulations, the number of features selected in the optimal solution monotonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial value to unity. We prove the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment based formulations, and show that the feature weights themselves decay (grow) monotonically once they are below (above) a certain threshold at optimality. This allows us to develop a path following algorithm that systematically generates optimal feature sets of decreasing size. The proposed algorithm sets certain feature weights directly to zero for potentially large intervals of p thereby reducing optimization costs while simultaneously providing approximation guarantees.We empirically demonstrate that our formulation can lead to classification accuracies which are as much as 10% higher on benchmark data sets not only as compared to other lp-MKL formulations and uniform kernel baselines but also leading feature selection methods. We further demonstrate that our algorithm reduces training time significantly over other path following algorithms and state-of-the-art lp-MKL optimizers such as SMO-MKL. In particular, we generate the entire feature selection path for data sets with a hundred thousand features in approximately half an hour on standard hardware. Entire path generation for such data set is well beyond the scaling capabilities of other methods.},

The proposed algorithm iterates between a standard gradient descent step and a hard truncation step with or without debiasing. We prove that our method enjoys the strong guarantees analogous to HTP in terms of rate of convergence and parameter estimation accuracy.

We show several theoretical guarantees within this framework, including loss consistency, norm consistency, sparsistency (i.e. support recovery) as well as sign consistency. A number of regularization problems can be shown to fall within our framework and we provide several examples. Our results can be seen as a concise summary of existing guarantees but we also extend them to new settings. Our formulation enables us to assume very little about the hypothesis class, data distribution, the loss, or the regularization. In particular, many of our results do not require a bounded hypothesis class, or identically distributed samples. Similarly, we do not assume boundedness, convexity or smoothness of the loss nor the regularizer. We only assume approximate optimality of the empirical minimizer. In terms of recovery, in contrast to existing results, our sparsistency and sign consistency results do not require knowledge of the sub-differential of the objective function.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Learning a distance function or metric on a given data manifold is of great importance in machine learning and pattern recognition. Many of the previous works first embed the manifold to Euclidean space and then learn the distance function. However, such a scheme might not faithfully preserve the distance function if the original manifold is not Euclidean. In this paper, we propose to learn the distance function directly on the manifold without embedding. We first provide a theoretical characterization of the distance function by its gradient field. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose to first learn the gradient field of the distance function and then learn the distance function itself. Specifically, we set the gradient field of a local distance function as an initial vector field. Then we transport it to the whole manifold via heat flow on vector fields. Finally, the geodesic distance function can be obtained by requiring its gradient field to be close to the normalized vector field. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

We then develop STRICT, an efficient algorithm for selecting examples to teach to workers. Our solution greedily maximizes a submodular surrogate objective function in order to select examples to showto the learners.

No-regret learning algorithms are known to guarantee convergence of a subsequence of population strategies. We are concerned with convergence of the actual sequence.

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In many recommendation applications such as news recommendation, the items that can be recommended come and go at a very fast pace. This is a challenge for recommender systems (RS) to face this setting. Online learning algorithms seem to be the most straight forward solution. The contextual bandit framework was introduced for that very purpose. In general the evaluation of a RS is a critical issue. Live evaluation is often avoided due to the potential loss of revenue, hence the need for offline evaluation methods. Two options are available. Model based methods are biased by nature and are thus difficult to trust when used alone. Data driven methods are therefore what we consider here. Evaluating online learning algorithms with past data is not simple but some methods exist in the literature. Nonetheless their accuracy is not satisfactory mainly due to their mechanism of data rejection that only allow the exploitation of a small fraction of the data. We precisely address this issue in this paper. After highlighting the limitations of the previous methods, we present a new method, based on bootstrapping techniques. This new method comes with two important improvements: it is much more accurate and it provides a measure of quality of its estimation. The latter is a highly desirable property in order to minimize the risks entailed by putting online a RS for the first time. We provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as an analysis of the convergence of the measure of quality.},

abstract = {We consider large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with parameter uncertainty, under the robust MDP paradigm. Previous studies showed that robust MDPs, based on a minimax approach to handling uncertainty, can be solved using dynamic programming for small to medium sized problems. However, due to the "curse of dimensionality", MDPs that model real-life problems are typically prohibitively large for such approaches. In this work we employ a reinforcement learning approach to tackle this planning problem: we develop a robust approximate dynamic programming method based on a projected fixed point equation to approximately solve large scale robust MDPs. We show that the proposed method provably succeeds under certain technical conditions, and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulation of an option pricing problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to scale up the robust MDP paradigm.},

Besides being a natural metric by itself, we argue that in many applications, such as our motivating example from crowdsourcing, the aggregate regret bound is more suitable. We propose a new PAC algorithm, which, with probability at least 1 - δ, identifies a set of K arms with regret at most ε. We provide the sample complexity bound of our algorithm. To complement, we establish the lower bound and show that the sample complexity of our algorithm matches the lower bound.

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.},

However, due to the complex nature of the TV term, it is challenging to efficiently compute a solution for large-scale problems. State-of-the-art algorithms that are based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) often involve solving large-size linear systems. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable parallel algorithm for TV models that is based on a novel decomposition strategy of the problem domain. As a result, the TV models can be decoupled into a set of small and independent subproblems, which admit closed form solutions. This makes our approach particularly suitable for parallel implementation. Our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to its global minimum. With N variables and np processes, the time complexity is O(N/εnp) to reach an ε-optimal solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in dealing with high-resolution, megasize images.},

Moreover, each of these algorithms provably fails in the previous harder regimes. Our theorems establish the first minimax recovery results for the high-dimensional setting, and provide the best known guarantees for polynomialtime algorithms.

abstract = {We address the problem of noise management in clustering algorithms. Namely, issues that arise when on top of some cluster structure the data also contains an unstructured set of points. We consider how clustering algorithms can be "robustified" so that they recover the cluster structure in spite of the unstructured part of the input. We introduce some quantitative measures of such robustness that take into account the strength of the embedded cluster structure as well as the mildness of the noise subset. We propose a simple and efficient method to turn any centroid-based clustering algorithm into a noise-robust one, and prove robustness guarantees for our method with respect to these measures. We also prove that more straightforward ways of "robustifying" clustering algorithms fail to achieve similar guarantees.},

title = {Safe Screening with Variational Inequalities and Its Application to Lasso},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Sparse learning techniques have been routinely used for feature selection as the resulting model usually has a small number of non-zero entries. Safe screening, which eliminates the features that are guaranteed to have zero coefficients for a certain value of the regularization parameter, is a technique for improving the computational efficiency. Safe screening is gaining increasing attention since 1) solving sparse learning formulations usually has a high computational cost especially when the number of features is large and 2) one needs to try several regularization parameters to select a suitable model. In this paper, we propose an approach called "Sasvi" (Safe screening with variational inequalities). Sasvi makes use of the variational inequality that provides the sufficient and necessary optimality condition for the dual problem. Several existing approaches for Lasso screening can be casted as relaxed versions of the proposed Sasvi, thus Sasvi provides a stronger safe screening rule. We further study the monotone properties of Sasvi for Lasso, based on which a sure removal regularization parameter can be identified for each feature. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sasvi for Lasso screening.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We study the target node prediction problem: given two social networks, identify those nodes/users from one network (called the source network) who are likely to join another (called the target network, with nodes called target nodes). Although this problem can be solved using existing techniques in the field of cross domain classification, we observe that in many realworld situations the cross-domain classifiers perform sub-optimally due to the heterogeneity between source and target networks that prevents the knowledge from being transferred. In this paper, we propose learning the consistent behavior of common users to help the knowledge transfer. We first present the Consistent Incidence Co-Factorization (CICF) for identifying the consistent users, i.e., common users that behave consistently across networks. Then we introduce the Domain-UnBiased (DUB) classifiers that transfer knowledge only through those consistent users. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results show that our proposal copes with heterogeneity and improves prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {A key goal of AI is to create lifelong learning agents that can leverage prior experience to improve performance on later tasks. In reinforcement-learning problems, one way to summarize prior experience for future use is through options, which are temporally extended actions (subpolicies) for how to behave. Options can then be used to potentially accelerate learning in new reinforcement learning tasks. In this work, we provide the first formal analysis of the sample complexity, a measure of learning speed, of reinforcement learning with options. This analysis helps shed light on some interesting prior empirical results on when and how options may accelerate learning. We then quantify the benefit of options in reducing sample complexity of a lifelong learning agent. Finally, the new theoretical insights inspire a novel option-discovery algorithm that aims at minimizing overall sample complexity in lifelong reinforcement learning.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {To tackle a multi-label classification problem with many classes, recently label space dimension reduction (LSDR) is proposed. It encodes the original label space to a low-dimensional latent space and uses a decoding process for recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel method termed FaIE to perform LSDR via Feature-aware Implicit label space Encoding. Unlike most previous work, the proposed FaIE makes no assumptions about the encoding process and directly learns a code matrix, i.e. the encoding result of some implicit encoding function, and a linear decoding matrix. To learn both matrices, FaIE jointly maximizes the recoverability of the original label space from the latent space, and the predictability of the latent space from the feature space, thus making itself feature-aware. FaIE can also be specified to learn an explicit encoding function, and extended with kernel tricks to handle non-linear correlations between the feature space and the latent space. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets well demonstrate its effectiveness.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Structured prediction is an important and well-studied problem with many applications across machine learning. GPstruct is a recently proposed structured prediction model that offers appealing properties such as being kernelised, non-parametric, and supporting Bayesian inference (Brati\`{e}res et al., 2013). The model places a Gaussian process prior over energy functions which describe relationships between input variables and structured output variables. However, the memory demand of GPstruct is quadratic in the number of latent variables and training runtime scales cubically. This prevents GPstruct from being applied to problems involving grid factor graphs, which are prevalent in computer vision and spatial statistics applications.Here we explore a scalable approach to learning GPstruct models based on ensemble learning, with weak learners (predictors) trained on subsets of the latent variables and bootstrap data, which can easily be distributed. We show experiments with 4M latent variables on image segmentation. Our method outperforms widely-used conditional random field models trained with pseudo-likelihood. Moreover, in image segmentation problems it improves over recent state-of-the-art marginal optimisation methods in terms of predictive performance and uncertainty calibration. Finally, it generalises well on all training set sizes.},

Anomaly ranking refers to the unsupervised learning task which consists in building a scoring function, based on unlabeled data, with a MV curve as low as possible at any point. In this paper, it is proved that, in the case where the data generating probability distribution has compact support, anomaly ranking is equivalent to (supervised) bipartite ranking, where the goal is to discriminate between the underlying probability distribution and the uniform distribution with same support. In this situation, the MV curve can be then seen as a simple transform of the corresponding ROC curve. Exploiting this view, we then show how to use bipartite ranking algorithms, possibly combined with random sampling, to solve the MV curve minimization problem. Numerical experiments based on a variety of bipartite ranking algorithms well-documented in the literature are displayed in order to illustrate the relevance of our approach.},

Conventionally, a variety of probabilistic models have been advanced for the first two, including the product of Chinese restaurant processes and the Mondrian process. However, existing models for arbitrary partitioning are too complicated to permit the analysis of the statistical behaviors of models, which places very severe capability limits on relational data analysis. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model of arbitrary partitioning called the rectangular tiling process (RTP). Our model has a sound mathematical base in projective systems and infinite extension of conditional probabilities, and is capable of representing partitions of infinite elements as found in ordinary Bayesian nonparametric models.},

We derive an efficient stochastic inference algorithm for PMF models of fully observed binary matrices. Our method exhibits faster convergence rates than more expensive batch approaches and has better predictive performance than scalable alternatives. The proposed method includes new data subsampling strategies which produce large gains over standard uniform subsampling. We also address the task of automatically selecting the size of the minibatches of data used by our method. For this, we derive an algorithm that adjusts this hyper-parameter online.},

This has attracted considerable attention over the last decade, with state of the art statistical estimators based on solving regularized convex programs. While these typically non-smooth convex programs can be solved by the state of the art optimization methods in polynomial time, scaling them to very large-scale problems is an ongoing and rich area of research. In this paper, we attempt to address this scaling issue at the source, by asking whether one can build simpler possibly closed-form estimators, that yet come with statistical guarantees that are nonetheless comparable to regularized likelihood estimators. We answer this question in the affirmative, with variants of the classical ridge and OLS (ordinary least squares estimators) for linear regression. We analyze our estimators in the high-dimensional setting, and moreover provide empirical corroboration of its performance on simulated as well as real world microarray data.},

We are interested in recovery under high-dimensional settings, where the number of features p is potentially larger than the number of samples n, and where we need to impose structural constraints. In a natural distributional setting for this problem, the feature functions comprise the sufficient statistics of an exponential family, so that the problem would entail estimating structured moments of exponential family distributions. For instance, in the special case of covariance estimation, the natural distributional setting would correspond to the multivariate Gaussian distribution. Unlike the inverse covariance estimation case, we show that the regularized MLEs for covariance estimation, as well as natural Dantzig variants, are non-convex, even when the regularization functions themselves are convex; with the same holding for the general structured moment case. We propose a class of elementary convex estimators, that in many cases are available in closed-form, for estimating general structured moments. We then provide a unified statistical analysis of our class of estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our class of estimators via simulation and on real-world climatology and biology datasets.},

In this paper, we generalize GP classification in order to account for multiple annotators with different levels expertise. By explicitly handling uncertainty, Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a natural framework for building proper multiple-annotator models. We empirically show that our model significantly outperforms other commonly used approaches, such as majority voting, without a significant increase in the computational cost of approximate Bayesian inference. Furthermore, an active learning methodology is proposed, which is able to reduce annotation cost even further.},

Thus, unlike the most popular influence network approaches, our method, called SPIN, is context-sensitive, namely, the presence, the direction and the dynamics of influences depend on the properties of the actions. The inference problems of finding the highest scoring as well as the worst margin violating networks, are proven to be NP-hard. To solve the problems, we present an approximate inference method through a semi-definite programming relaxation (SDP), as well as a more scalable greedy heuristic algorithm.In our experiments, we demonstrate that taking advantage of the context given by the actions and the network structure leads SPIN to a markedly better predictive performance over competing methods.},

RALP is unique among L1-regularized approaches in that it approximates the optimal value function using off-policy samples. Additionally, it produces policies which outperform those of previous methods, such as LSPI. RALP's value function approximation quality is affected heavily by the choice of state-relevance weights in the objective function of the linear program, and by the distribution from which samples are drawn; however, there has been no discussion of these considerations in the previous literature. In this paper, we discuss and explain the effects of choices in the state-relevance weights and sampling distribution on approximation quality, using both theoretical and experimental illustrations. The results provide insight not only onto these effects, but also provide intuition into the types of MDPs which are especially well suited for approximation with RALP.},

In detail, we prove a theorem of optimization equivalences between β- and γ-, as well as α- and R\'{e}nyi-divergences through a connection scalar. Through the equivalences we represent several nonlinear dimensionality reduction and graph drawing methods in a generalized stochastic neighbor embedding setting, where information divergences are minimized between similarities in input and output spaces, and the optimal connection scalar provides a natural choice for the tradeoff between attractive and repulsive forces. We give two examples of developing new visualization methods through the equivalences: 1) We develop weighted symmetric stochastic neighbor embedding (ws-SNE) from Elastic Embedding and analyze its benefits, good performance for both vectorial and network data; in experiments ws-SNE has good performance across data sets of different types, whereas comparison methods fail for some of the data sets; 2) we develop a γ-divergence version of a PolyLog layout method; the new method is scale invariant in the output space and makes it possible to efficiently use large-scale smoothed neighborhoods.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Estimating the most likely configuration (MAP) is one of the fundamental tasks in probabilistic models. While MAP inference is typically intractable for many real-world applications, linear programming relaxations have been proven very effective. Dual block-coordinate descent methods are among the most efficient solvers, however, they are prone to get stuck in sub-optimal points. Although subgradient approaches achieve global convergence, they are typically slower in practice. To improve convergence speed, algorithms which compute the steepest ε-descent direction by solving a quadratic program have been proposed. In this paper we suggest to decouple the quadratic program based on the Frank-Wolfe approach. This allows us to obtain an efficient and easy to parallelize algorithm while retaining the global convergence properties. Our method proves superior when compared to existing algorithms on a set of spin-glass models and protein design tasks.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We consider the problem of controlling a Markov decision process (MDP) with a large state space, so as to minimize average cost. Since it is intractable to compete with the optimal policy for large scale problems, we pursue the more modest goal of competing with a low-dimensional family of policies. We use the dual linear programming formulation of the MDP average cost problem, in which the variable is a stationary distribution over state-action pairs, and we consider a neighborhood of a low-dimensional subset of the set of stationary distributions (defined in terms of state-action features) as the comparison class. We propose a technique based on stochastic convex optimization and give bounds that show that the performance of our algorithm approaches the best achievable by any policy in the comparison class. Most importantly, this result depends on the size of the comparison class, but not on the size of the state space. Preliminary experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a queuing application.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVM) is among the most popular classification techniques in machine learning, hence designing fast primal SVM algorithms for large-scale datasets is a hot topic in recent years. This paper presents a new L2- norm regularized primal SVM solver using Augmented Lagrange Multipliers, with linear computational cost for Lp-norm loss functions. The most computationally intensive steps (that determine the algorithmic complexity) of the proposed algorithm is purely and simply matrix-byvector multiplication, which can be easily parallelized on a multi-core server for parallel computing. We implement and integrate our algorithm into the interfaces and framework of the well-known LibLinear software toolbox. Experiments show that our algorithm is with stable performance and on average faster than the state-of-the-art solvers such as SVMper f, Pegasos and the LibLinear that integrates the TRON, PCD and DCD algorithms.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Memory efficiency is an important issue in Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms, arising for example in inference of high-dimensional latent variables via Rao-Blackwellized SMC algorithms, where the size of individual particles combined with the required number of particles can stress the main memory. Standard SMC methods have a memory requirement that scales linearly in the number of particles present at all stage of the algorithm. Our contribution is a simple scheme that makes the memory cost of SMC methods depends on the number of distinct particles that survive resampling. We show that this difference has a large empirical impact on the quality of the approximation in realistic scenarios, and also--since memory access is generally slow--on the running time.The method is based on a two pass generation of the particles, which are represented implicitly in the first pass. We parameterize the accuracy of our algorithm with a memory budget rather than with a fixed number of particles. Our algorithm adaptively selects an optimal number of particle to exploit this fixed memory budget. We show that this adaptation does not interfere with the usual consistency guarantees that come with SMC algorithms.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used method for classification. Although many efforts have been devoted to develop efficient solvers, it remains challenging to apply SVM to large-scale problems. A nice property of SVM is that the non-support vectors have no effect on the resulting classifier. Motivated by this observation, we present fast and efficient screening rules to discard non-support vectors by analyzing the dual problem of SVM via variational inequalities (DVI). As a result, the number of data instances to be entered into the optimization can be substantially reduced. Some appealing features of our screening method are: (1) DVI is safe in the sense that the vectors discarded by DVI are guaranteed to be non-support vectors; (2) the data set needs to be scanned only once to run the screening, and its computational cost is negligible compared to that of solving the SVM problem; (3) DVI is independent of the solvers and can be integrated with any existing efficient solver. We also show that the DVI technique can be extended to detect non-support vectors in the least absolute deviations regression (LAD). To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no screening methods for LAD. We have evaluated DVI on both synthetic and real data sets. Experiments indicate that DVI significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art screening rules for SVM, and it is very effective in discarding nonsupport vectors for LAD. The speedup gained by DVI rules can be up to two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {The performance of machine learning methods is heavily dependent on the choice of data representation. In real world applications such as scene recognition problems, the widely used low-level input features can fail to explain the high-level semantic label concepts. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel patch-based latent variable model to integrate latent contextual representation learning and classification model training in one joint optimization framework. Within this framework, the latent layer of variables bridge the gap between inputs and outputs by providing discriminative explanations for the semantic output labels, while being predictable from the low-level input features. Experiments conducted on standard scene recognition tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, comparing to the state-of-the-art scene recognition methods.},

abstract = {We consider learning and planning in relational MDPs when object existence is uncertain and new objects may appear or disappear depending on previous actions or properties of other objects. Optimal policies actively need to discover objects to achieve a goal; planning in such domains in general amounts to a POMDP problem, where the belief is about the existence and properties of potential not-yet-discovered objects. We propose a computationally efficient extension of model-based relational RL methods that approximates these beliefs using discrete uncertainty predicates. In this formulation the belief update is learned using probabilistic rules and planning in the approximated belief space can be achieved using an extension of existing planners. We prove that the learned belief update rules encode an approximation of the exact belief updates of a POMDP formulation and demonstrate experimentally that the proposed approach successfully learns a set of relational rules appropriate to solve such problems.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Q-learning, the most popular of reinforcement learning algorithms, has always included an extension to eligibility traces to enable more rapid learning and improved asymptotic performance on non-Markov problems. The λ parameter smoothly shifts on-policy algorithms such as TD(λ) and Sarsa(λ) from a pure bootstrapping form (λ=0) to a pure Monte Carlo form (λ=1). In off-policy algorithms, including Q(λ), GQ(λ), and off-policy LSTD(λ), the λ parameter is intended to play the same role, but does not; on every exploratory action these algorithms bootstrap regardless of the value of λ, and as a result they fail to approximate Monte Carlo learning when λ = 1. It may seem that this is inevitable for any online off-policy algorithm; if updates are made on each step on which the target policy is followed, then how could just the right updates be 'un-made' upon deviation from the target policy? In this paper, we introduce a new version of Q(λ) that does exactly that, without significantly increased algorithmic complexity. En route to our new Q(λ), we introduce a new derivation technique based on the forward-view/backward-view analysis familiar from TD(λ) but extended to apply at every time step rather than only at the end of episodes. We apply this technique to derive first a new off-policy version of TD(λ), called PTD(λ), and then our new Q(λ), called PQ(λ).},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Previous analysis of binary support vector machines (SVMs) has demonstrated a deep connection between robustness to perturbations over uncertainty sets and regularization of the weights. In this paper, we explore the problem of learning robust models for structured prediction problems. We first formulate the problem of learning robust structural SVMs when there are perturbations in the sample space, and show how we can construct corresponding bounds on the perturbations in the feature space. We then show that robustness to perturbations in the feature space is equivalent to additional regularization. For an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, the additional regularizer is based on the dual norm of the norm that constrains the ellipsoidal uncertainty. For a polyhedral uncertainty set, the robust optimization problem is equivalent to adding a linear regularizer in a transformed weight space related to the linear constraints of the polyhedron. We also show that these constraint sets can be combined and demonstrate a number of interesting special cases. This represents the first theoretical analysis of robust optimization of structural support vector machines. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms the nonrobust structural SVMs on real world data when the test data distribution has drifted from the training data distribution.},

abstract = {Cost-sensitive multiclass classification has recently acquired significance in several applications, through the introduction of multi-class datasets with well-defined misclassification costs. The design of classification algorithms for this setting is considered. It is argued that the unreliable performance of current algorithms is due to the inability of the underlying loss functions to enforce a certain fundamental underlying property. This property, denoted guess-aversion, is that the loss should encourage correct classifications over the arbitrary guessing that ensues when all classes are equally scored by the classifier. While guess-aversion holds trivially for binary classification, this is not true in the multiclass setting. A new family of cost-sensitive guess-averse loss functions is derived, and used to design new cost-sensitive multiclass boosting algorithms, denoted GEL- and GLL-MCBoost. Extensive experiments demonstrate (1) the importance of guess-aversion and (2) that the GLL loss function outperforms other loss functions for multiclass boosting.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for minimizing a sum of functions that combines the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the second order curvature information leveraged by quasi-Newton methods. We unify these disparate approaches by maintaining an independent Hessian approximation for each contributing function in the sum. We maintain computational tractability and limit memory requirements even for high dimensional optimization problems by storing and manipulating these quadratic approximations in a shared, time evolving, low dimensional subspace. This algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques that treat the Hessian of each contributing function as a noisy approximation to the full Hessian, rather than as a target for direct estimation. Each update step requires only a single contributing function or minibatch evaluation (as in SGD), and each step is scaled using an approximate inverse Hessian and little to no adjustment of hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods). We experimentally demonstrate improved convergence on seven diverse optimization problems. The algorithm is released as open source Python and MATLAB packages.},

It is a classic problem, and the natural and empirically most popular approach to its solution has been the EM algorithm. As in other settings, this is prone to bad local minima; however, each iteration is very fast (alternating between guessing labels, and solving with those labels).In this paper we provide a new initialization procedure for EM, based on finding the leading two eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. We then show that with this, a re-sampled version of the EM algorithm provably converges to the correct vectors, under natural assumptions on the sampling distribution, and with nearly optimal (unimprovable) sample complexity. This provides not only the first characterization of EM's performance, but also much lower sample complexity as compared to both standard (randomly initialized) EM, and other methods for this problem.},

Most current approaches focus on learning how to reweigh the training examples, to make them resemble the test distribution. However, reweighing does not always help, because (we show that) the test error also depends on the correctness of the underlying model class. This paper analyses this situation by viewing the problem of learning under changing distributions as a game between a learner and an adversary. We characterize when such reweighing is needed, and also provide an algorithm, robust covariate shift adjustment (RCSA), that provides relevant weights. Our empirical studies, on UCI datasets and a real-world cancer prognostic prediction dataset, show that our analysis applies, and that our RCSA works effectively.},

abstract = {Spectral methods have greatly advanced the estimation of latent variable models, generating a sequence of novel and efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. However, current spectral algorithms are largely restricted to mixtures of discrete or Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we propose a kernel method for learning multi-view latent variable models, allowing each mixture component to be nonparametric and learned from data in an unsupervised fashion. The key idea of our method is to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable model into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are recovered using a robust tensor power method. We establish that the sample complexity for the proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is a low order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our nonparametric tensor approach to learning latent variable models enjoys good sample and computational efficiencies. As a special case of our framework, we also obtain a first unsupervised conditional density estimator of the kind with provable guarantees. In both synthetic and real world datasets, the nonparametric tensor power method compares favorably to EM algorithm and other spectral algorithms.},

Although this problem has been well studied in the supervised setting, little is known about its unsupervised counterpart. In this work, we focus on the problem of clustering high-dimensional data with sparse centers. In particular, we address the following open question in unsupervised learning: "is it possible to reliably cluster high-dimensional data when the number of samples is smaller than the data dimensionality?" We develop an efficient clustering algorithm that is able to estimate sparse cluster centers with a single pass over the data. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is able to accurately recover cluster centers with only O(s log d) number of samples (data points), provided all the cluster centers are s-sparse vectors in a d dimensional space. Experimental results verify both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed clustering algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets.},

First, in small samples, the estimates from the implicit procedure are more biased than the estimates from the explicit one, but their empirical variance is smaller and they are more robust to learning rate misspecification. Second, the two procedures are statistically identical in the limit: they are both unbiased, converge at the same rate and have the same asymptotic variance. Our set of experiments confirm our theory and more broadly suggest that the implicit procedure can be a competitive choice for fitting large-scale models, especially when robustness is a concern.},

abstract = {The method of random projections has become popular for large-scale applications in statistical learning, information retrieval, bio-informatics and other applications. Using a well-designed coding scheme for the projected data, which determines the number of bits needed for each projected value and how to allocate these bits, can significantly improve the effectiveness of the algorithm, in storage cost as well as computational speed. In this paper, we study a number of simple coding schemes, focusing on the task of similarity estimation and on an application to training linear classifiers. We demonstrate that uniform quantization outperforms the standard and influential method (Datar et al., 2004), which used a window-and-random offset scheme. Indeed, we argue that in many cases coding with just a small number of bits suffices. Furthermore, we also develop a non-uniform 2-bit coding scheme that generally performs well in practice, as confirmed by our experiments on training linear support vector machines (SVM). Proofs and additional experiments are available at arXiv:1308.2218.In the context of using coded random projections for approximate near neighbor search by building hash tables (arXiv:1403.8144) (Li et al., 2014), we show that the step of random off-set in (Datar et al., 2004) is again not needed and may hurt the performance. Furthermore, we show that, unless the target similarity level is high, it usually suffices to use only 1 or 2 bits to code each hashed value for this task.

abstract = {We present new algorithms to compute the mean of a set of empirical probability measures under the optimal transport metric. This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter, is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We propose two original algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters that build upon the subgradient method. A direct implementation of these algorithms is, however, too costly because it would require the repeated resolution of large primal and dual optimal transport problems to compute subgradients. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we propose to smooth the Wasserstein distance used in the definition of Wasserstein barycenters with an entropic regularizer and recover in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a constrained clustering problem.},

title = {Global Graph Kernels Using Geometric Embeddings},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Applications of machine learning methods increasingly deal with graph structured data through kernels. Most existing graph kernels compare graphs in terms of features defined on small subgraphs such as walks, paths or graphlets, adopting an inherently local perspective. However, several interesting properties such as girth or chromatic number are global properties of the graph, and are not captured in local substructures. This paper presents two graph kernels defined on unlabeled graphs which capture global properties of graphs using the celebrated Lov\'{a}sz number and its associated orthonormal representation. We make progress towards theoretical results aiding kernel choice, proving a result about the separation margin of our kernel for classes of graphs. We give empirical results on classification of synthesized graphs with important global properties as well as established benchmark graph datasets, showing that the accuracy of our kernels is better than or competitive to existing graph kernels.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Topic modeling has been commonly used to discover topics from document collections. However, unsupervised models can generate many incoherent topics. To address this problem, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed to incorporate prior domain knowledge from the user. This work advances this research much further and shows that without any user input, we can mine the prior knowledge automatically and dynamically from topics already found from a large number of domains. This paper first proposes a novel method to mine such prior knowledge dynamically in the modeling process, and then a new topic model to use the knowledge to guide the model inference. What is also interesting is that this approach offers a novel lifelong learning algorithm for topic discovery, which exploits the big (past) data and knowledge gained from such data for subsequent modeling. Our experimental results using product reviews from 50 domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Unsupervised feature learning is the task of using unlabeled examples for building a representation of objects as vectors. This task has been extensively studied in recent years, mainly in the context of unsupervised pre-training of neural networks. Recently, Coates et al. (2011) conducted extensive experiments, comparing the accuracy of a linear classifier that has been trained using features learnt by several unsupervised feature learning methods. Surprisingly, the best performing method was the simplest feature learning approach that was based on applying the K-means clustering algorithm after a whitening of the data. The goal of this work is to shed light on the success of K-means with whitening for the task of unsupervised feature learning. Our main result is a close connection between K-means and ICA (Independent Component Analysis). Specifically, we show that K-means and similar clustering algorithms can be used to recover the ICA mixing matrix or its inverse, the ICA filters. It is well known that the independent components found by ICA form useful features for classification (Le et al., 2012; 2011; 2010), hence the connection between K-mean and ICA explains the empirical success of K-means as a feature learner. Moreover, our analysis underscores the significance of the whitening operation, as was also observed in the experiments reported in Coates et al. (2011). Finally, our analysis leads to a better initialization of K-means for the task of feature learning.},

abstract = {It is known that the solution of regularization and interpolation problems with Hilbertian penalties can be expressed as a linear combination of the data. This very useful property, called the representer theorem, has been widely studied and applied to machine learning problems. Analogous optimality conditions have appeared in other contexts, notably in matrix regularization. In this paper we propose a unified view, which generalizes the concept of representer theorems and extends necessary and sufficient conditions for such theorems to hold. Our main result shows a close connection between representer theorems and certain classes of regularization penalties, which we call orthomonotone functions. This result not only subsumes previous representer theorems as special cases but also yields a new class of optimality conditions, which goes beyond the classical linear combination of the data. Moreover, orthomonotonicity provides a useful criterion for testing whether a representer theorem holds for a specific regularization problem.},

Cold-start is one of the most challenging tasks for recommender systems: what to recommend with new users or items for which one has little or no data. An approach is to use active learning to collect the most useful initial ratings. However, the performance of active learning depends strongly upon having accurate estimates of i) the uncertainty in model parameters and ii) the intrinsic noisiness of the data. To achieve these estimates we propose a heteroskedastic Bayesian model for ordinal matrix factorization. We also present a computationally efficient framework for Bayesian active learning with this type of complex probabilistic model. This algorithm successfully distinguishes between informative and noisy data points. Our model yields state-of-the-art predictive performance and, coupled with our active learning strategy, enables us to gain useful information in the cold-start setting from the very first active sample.},

So as to obtain the optimal labeling scores, the label propagation algorithm requires an inverse matrix which incurs the high computational cost of O(n3+cn2), where n and c are the numbers of data points and labels, respectively. This paper proposes an efficient label propagation algorithm that guarantees exactly the same labeling results as those yielded by optimal labeling scores. The key to our approach is to iteratively compute lower and upper bounds of labeling scores to prune unnecessary score computations. This idea significantly reduces the computational cost to O(cnt) where t is the average number of iterations for each label and t ≪ n in practice. Experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our algorithm over existing label propagation methods.},

abstract = {Information spreads across social and technological networks, but often the network structures are hidden from us and we only observe the traces left by the diffusion processes, called cascades. Can we recover the hidden network structures from these observed cascades? What kind of cascades and how many cascades do we need? Are there some network structures which are more difficult than others to recover? Can we design efficient inference algorithms with provable guarantees?Despite the increasing availability of cascade-data and methods for inferring networks from these data, a thorough theoretical understanding of the above questions remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the network structure inference problem for a general family of continuous-time diffusion models using an l1-regularized likelihood maximization framework. We show that, as long as the cascade sampling process satisfies a natural incoherence condition, our framework can recover the correct network structure with high probability if we observe O(d3 log N) cascades, where d is the maximum number of parents of a node and N is the total number of nodes. Moreover, we develop a simple and efficient soft-thresholding inference algorithm, which we use to illustrate the consequences of our theoretical results, and show that our framework outperforms other alternatives in practice.},

abstract = {In display advertising, click through rate (CTR) prediction is the problem of estimating the probability that an advertisement (ad) is clicked when displayed to a user in a specific context. Due to its easy implementation and promising performance, logistic regression (LR) model has been widely used for CTR prediction, especially in industrial systems. However, it is not easy for LR to capture the nonlinear information, such as the conjunction information, from user features and ad features. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called coupled group lasso (CGL), for CTR prediction in display advertising. CGL can seamlessly integrate the conjunction information from user features and ad features for modeling. Furthermore, CGL can automatically eliminate useless features for both users and ads, which may facilitate fast online prediction. Scalability of CGL is ensured through feature hashing and distributed implementation. Experimental results on real-world data sets show that our CGL model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on webscale CTR prediction tasks.},

abstract = {While the conventional compressive sensing assumes measurements of infinite precision, one-bit compressive sensing considers an extreme setting where each measurement is quantized to just a single bit. In this paper, we study the vector recovery problem from noisy one-bit measurements, and develop two novel algorithms with formal theoretical guarantees. First, we propose a passive algorithm, which is very efficient in the sense it only needs to solve a convex optimization problem that has a closed-form solution. Despite the apparent simplicity, our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm can recover both the exactly sparse and the approximately sparse vectors. In particular, for a sparse vector with s nonzero elements, the sample complexity is O(s log n/ε2), where n is the dimensionality and ε is the recovery error. This result improves significantly over the previously best known sample complexity in the noisy setting, which is O(s log n/ε4). Second, in the case that the noise model is known, we develop an adaptive algorithm based on the principle of active learning. The key idea is to solicit the sign information only when it cannot be inferred from the current estimator. Compared with the passive algorithm, the adaptive one has a lower sample complexity if a high-precision solution is desired.},

A novel framework is proposed that integrates two aspects of the large margin principle (angle and distance), which simultaneously encourage angle consistency between preference pairs and maximize the distance between examples in preference pairs. Two specific algorithms are developed: an alternating direction method to learn a linear transformation matrix and a gradient boosting technique to optimize a non-linear transformation directly in the function space. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed large margin optimization criteria can strengthen and improve the robustness and generalization performance of preference learning algorithms on the obtained low-dimensional subspace. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significance of studying dimensionality reduction in the weakly supervised setting and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Our point of departure is a nearly Bayes-optimal finite-sample risk bound independent of k. Although k-free, this bound is un-regularized and non-adaptive, which motivates our main result: Rademacher and scale-sensitive margin bounds with a logarithmic dependence on k. As the best previous risk estimates in this setting were of order √k, our bound is exponentially sharper.

GCB only requires feedback on a small set of actions and achieves O(T2/3 log T) distribution-independent regret and O(log T) distribution-dependent regret (the latter assuming unique optimal action), where T is the total time steps played. Moreover, the regret bounds only depend linearly on log |χ| rather than |χ|, where χ is the action space. GCB isolates offline optimization tasks from online learning and avoids explicit enumeration of all actions in the online learning part. We demonstrate that our model and algorithm can be applied to a crowdsourcing application leading to both an efficient learning algorithm and low regret, and argue that they can be applied to a wide range of combinatorial applications constrained with limited feedback.},

We show that these estimators achieve the parametric convergence rate of n-1/2 when the densities' smoothness, s, are both at least d/4 where d is the dimension. We also derive minimax lower bounds for this problem which confirm that s &gt; d/4 is necessary to achieve the n-1/2 rate of convergence.

abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework for minimizing expensive objective functions while using very few function evaluations. It has been successfully applied to a variety of problems, including hyperparameter tuning and experimental design. However, this framework has not been extended to the inequality-constrained optimization setting, particularly the setting in which evaluating feasibility is just as expensive as evaluating the objective. Here we present constrained Bayesian optimization, which places a prior distribution on both the objective and the constraint functions. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, demonstrating that constrained Bayesian optimization can quickly find optimal and feasible points, even when small feasible regions cause standard methods to fail.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Binary embedding of high-dimensional data requires long codes to preserve the discriminative power of the input space. Traditional binary coding methods often suffer from very high computation and storage costs in such a scenario. To address this problem, we propose Circulant Binary Embedding (CBE) which generates binary codes by projecting the data with a circulant matrix. The circulant structure enables the use of Fast Fourier Transformation to speed up the computation. Compared to methods that use unstructured matrices, the proposed method improves the time complexity from O(d2) to O(d log d), and the space complexity from O(d2) to O(d) where d is the input dimensionality. We also propose a novel time-frequency alternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections, which alternatively minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains. We show by extensive experiments that the proposed approach gives much better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches for fixed time, and provides much faster computation with no performance degradation for fixed number of bits.},

abstract = {It has been shown that graphical models can be used to leverage the dependence in large-scale multiple testing problems with significantly improved performance (Sun &amp; Cai, 2009; Liu et al., 2012). These graphical models are fully parametric and require that we know the parameterization of f1 -- the density function of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis. However in practice,f1 is often heterogeneous, and cannot be estimated with a simple parametric distribution. We propose a novel semiparametric approach for multiple testing under dependence, which estimatesf1 adaptively. This semiparametric approach exactly generalizes the local FDR procedure (Efron et al., 2001) and connects with the BH procedure (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995). A variety of simulations show that our semiparametric approach outperforms classical procedures which assume independence and the parametric approaches which capture dependence.},

title = {Making Fisher Discriminant Analysis Scalable},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for classification and dimension reduction jointly. A major limitation of the conventional LDA is a so-called singularity issue. Many LDA variants, especially two-stage methods such as PCA+LDA and LDA/QR, were proposed to solve this issue. In the two-stage methods, an intermediate stage for dimension reduction is developed before the actual LDA method works. These two-stage methods are scalable because they are an approximate alternative of the LDA method. However, there is no theoretical analysis on how well they approximate the conventional LDA problem. In this paper we present theoretical analysis on the approximation error of a two-stage algorithm. Accordingly, we develop a new two-stage algorithm. Furthermore, we resort to a random projection approach, making our algorithm scalable. We also provide an implemention on distributed system to handle large scale problems. Our algorithm takes LDA/QR as its special case, and out-performs PCA+LDA while having a similar scalability. We also generalize our algorithm to kernel discriminant analysis, a nonlinear version of the classical LDA. Extensive experiments show that our algorithms outperform PCA+LDA and have a similar scalability with it.},

First, we show by using the Fokker-Planck equation that the probability distribution of random variables generated by the SGLD algorithm converges to the Bayesian posterior. Second, we analyze the convergence of the SGLD algorithm by using the It\^{o} process, which reveals that the SGLD algorithm does not strongly but weakly converges. This result indicates that the SGLD algorithm can be an approximation method for posterior averaging.},

We explore this concept with a case study of approximation algorithms for finding locally-biased partitions in data graphs, demonstrating connections between min-cut objectives, a personalized version of the popular PageRank vector, and the highly effective "push" procedure for computing an approximation to personalized PageRank. We show, for example, that this latter algorithm solves (exactly, but implicitly) an l1-regularized l2-regression problem, a fact that helps to explain its excellent performance in practice. We expect that, when available, these implicit optimization problems will be critical for rationalizing and predicting the performance of many approximation algorithms on realistic data.},

abstract = {Bayesian methods are ubiquitous in machine learning. Nevertheless, the analysis of empirical results is typically performed by frequentist tests. This implies dealing with null hypothesis significance tests and p-values, even though the shortcomings of such methods are well known. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian version of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test using a Dirichlet process (DP) based prior. We address in two different ways the problem of how to choose the infinite dimensional parameter that characterizes the DP. The proposed test has all the traditional strengths of the Bayesian approach; for instance, unlike the frequentist tests, it allows verifying the null hypothesis, not only rejecting it, and taking decisions which minimize the expected loss. Moreover, one of the solutions proposed to model the infinite-dimensional parameter of the DP allows isolating instances in which the traditional frequentist test is guessing at random. We show results dealing with the comparison of two classifiers using real and simulated data.},

In this approach the min-max inference problem is reduced to a sequence of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), which allows us to solve the problem by sampling from a uniform distribution over the set of solutions. We demonstrate how this scheme provides a message passing solution to several NP-hard combinatorial problems, such as minmax clustering (a.k.a. K-clustering), asymmetric K-center clustering problem, K-packing and the bottleneck traveling salesman problem. Furthermore, we theoretically relate the min-max reductions and several NP hard decision problems such as clique cover, set-cover, maximum clique and Hamiltonian cycle, therefore also providing message passing solutions for these problems. Experimental results suggest that message passing often provides near optimal min-max solutions for moderate size instances.},

The active sets are often found to be sensitive to small differences among data points, resulting in only near duplicate retrieval. We show that this sensitivity is related to the coherence of the dictionary; small coherence resulting in better retrieval. To this end, we propose a novel dictionary learning formulation with incoherence constraints and an efficient method to solve it.

abstract = {In recent applications with massive but less reliable data (e.g., labels obtained by a semi-supervised learning method or crowdsourcing), non-robustness of the support vector machine (SVM) often causes considerable performance deterioration. Although improving the robustness of SVM has been investigated for long time, robust SVM (RSVM) learning still poses two major challenges: obtaining a good (local) solution from a non-convex optimization problem and optimally controlling the robustness-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we address these two issues simultaneously in an integrated way by introducing a novel homotopy approach to RSVM learning. Based on theoretical investigation of the geometry of RSVM solutions, we show that a path of local RSVM solutions can be computed efficiently when the influence of outliers is gradually suppressed as simulated annealing. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm tends to produce better local solutions than the alternative approach based on the concave-convex procedure, with the ability of stable and efficient model selection for controlling the influence of outliers.},

We propose a factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) for ensemble-based tracking by learning jointly the unknown trajectory of the target and the reliability of each tracker in the ensemble. For efficient online inference of the FHMM, we devise a conditional particle filter algorithm by exploiting the structure of the joint posterior distribution of the hidden variables. Using the largest open benchmark for visual tracking, we empirically compare two ensemble methods constructed from five state-of-the-art trackers with the individual trackers. The promising experimental results provide empirical evidence for our ensemble approach to "get the best of all worlds".},

abstract = {Recent advances in optimization theory have shown that smooth strongly convex finite sums can be minimized faster than by treating them as a black box "batch" problem. In this work we introduce a new method in this class with a theoretical convergence rate four times faster than existing methods, for sums with sufficiently many terms. This method is also amendable to a sampling without replacement scheme that in practice gives further speed-ups. We give empirical results showing state of the art performance.},

title = {Standardized Mutual Information for Clustering Comparisons: One Step Further in Adjustment for Chance},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Mutual information is a very popular measure for comparing clusterings. Previous work has shown that it is beneficial to make an adjustment for chance to this measure, by subtracting an expected value and normalizing via an upper bound. This yields the constant baseline property that enhances intuitiveness. In this paper, we argue that a further type of statistical adjustment for the mutual information is also beneficial - an adjustment to correct selection bias. This type of adjustment is useful when carrying out many clustering comparisons, to select one or more preferred clusterings. It reduces the tendency for the mutual information to choose clustering solutions i) with more clusters, or ii) induced on fewer data points, when compared to a reference one. We term our new adjusted measure the standardized mutual information. It requires computation of the variance of mutual information under a hypergeometric model of randomness, which is technically challenging. We derive an analytical formula for this variance and analyze its complexity. We then experimentally assess how our new measure can address selection bias and also increase interpretability. We recommend using the standardized mutual information when making multiple clustering comparisons in situations where the number of records is small compared to the number of clusters considered.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In applications of graphical models arising in domains such as computer vision and signal processing, we often seek the most likely configurations of high-dimensional, continuous variables. We develop a particle-based max-product algorithm which maintains a diverse set of posterior mode hypotheses, and is robust to initialization. At each iteration, the set of hypotheses at each node is augmented via stochastic proposals, and then reduced via an efficient selection algorithm. The integer program underlying our optimization-based particle selection minimizes errors in subsequent max-product message updates. This objective automatically encourages diversity in the maintained hypotheses, without requiring tuning of application-specific distances among hypotheses. By avoiding the stochastic resampling steps underlying particle sum-product algorithms, we also avoid common degeneracies where particles collapse onto a single hypothesis. Our approach significantly outperforms previous particle-based algorithms in experiments focusing on the estimation of human pose from single images.},

The nonlinear measurements are assumed contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. Depending on the application, we are either interested in recovering the high-dimensional data from the nonlinear compressive measurements, or performing classification directly based on these measurements. The latter case corresponds to classification based on nonlinearly constituted and noisy features. The nonlinear measurement functions are designed based on constrained mutual-information optimization. New analytic results are developed for the gradient of mutual information in this setting, for arbitrary input-signal statistics. We make connections to kernel-based methods, such as the support vector machine. Encouraging results are presented on multiple datasets, for both signal recovery and classification. The nonlinear approach is shown to be particularly valuable in high-noise scenarios.},

We prove accuracy and privacy theorems for our algorithm, and then demonstrate experimentally that our algorithm performs well in practice.

abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

We present an EM algorithm for learning and introduce a model selection criteria based on the physical notion of convergence in relaxation timescales.

abstract = {In large scale learning problems it is often easy to collect simple statistics of the data, but hard or impractical to store all the original data. A key question in this setting is how to construct classifiers based on such partial information. One traditional approach to the problem has been to use maximum entropy arguments to induce a complete distribution on variables from statistics. However, this approach essentially makes conditional independence assumptions about the distribution, and furthermore does not optimize prediction loss. Here we present a framework for discriminative learning given a set of statistics. Specifically, we address the case where all variables are discrete and we have access to various marginals. Our approach minimizes the worst case hinge loss in this case, which upper bounds the generalization error. We show that for certain sets of statistics the problem is tractable, and in the general case can be approximated using MAP LP relaxations. Empirical results show that the method is competitive with other approaches that use the same input.},

Although maximum likelihood learning is computationally hard, there do exist consistent learning algorithms (e.g., psuedo-likelihood and its variants). However, inference in the learned models is still hard, and thus they are not directly usable. In other words, given a probabilistic query they are not guaranteed to provide an answer that is close to the true one.In the current paper, we provide a learning algorithm that is guaranteed to provide approximately correct probabilistic inference. We focus on a particular class of models, namely high girth graphs in the correlation decay regime. It is well known that approximate inference (e.g, using loopy BP) in such models yields marginals that are close to the true ones. Motivated by this, we propose an algorithm that always returns models of this type, and hence in the models it returns inference is approximately correct. We derive finite sample results guaranteeing that beyond a certain sample size, the resulting models will answer probabilistic queries with a high level of accuracy.Results on synthetic data show that the models we learn indeed outperform those obtained by other algorithms, which do not return high girth graphs.},

Sparsity in GGM plays a central role both statistically and computationally. Unfortunately, real-world data often does not fit well to sparse graphical models. In this paper, we focus on a family of latent variable Gaussian graphical models (LVGGM), where the model is conditionally sparse given latent variables, but marginally non-sparse. In LVGGM, the inverse covariance matrix has a low-rank plus sparse structure, and can be learned in a regularized maximum likelihood framework. We derive novel parameter estimation error bounds for LVGGM under mild conditions in the high-dimensional setting. These results complement the existing theory on the structural learning, and open up new possibilities of using LVGGM for statistical inference.},

The algorithm simultaneously applies the "old" control lever, the learning rate, to control the regret in the adversarial regime and the new control lever to detect and exploit gaps between the arm losses. This secures problem-dependent "logarithmic" regret when gaps are present without compromising on the worst-case performance guarantee in the adversarial regime. We show that the algorithm can exploit both the usual expected gaps between the arm losses in the stochastic regime and deterministic gaps between the arm losses in the adversarial regime. The algorithm retains "logarithmic" regret guarantee in the stochastic regime even when some observations are contaminated by an adversary, as long as on average the contamination does not reduce the gap by more than a half. Our results for the stochastic regime are supported by experimental validation.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Algorithmically, many machine learning tasks boil down to solving parameterized optimization problems. The choice of the parameter values in these problems can have a significant influence on the statistical performance of the corresponding methods. Thus, algorithmic support for choosing good parameter values has received quite some attention recently, especially algorithms for computing the whole solution path of a parameterized optimization problem. These algorithms can be used, for instance, to track the solution of a regularized learning problem along the regularization parameter path, or for tracking the solution of kernelized problems along a kernel hyperparameter path. Since exact path following algorithms can be numerically unstable, robust and efficient approximate path tracking algorithms have gained in popularity for regularized learning problems. By now algorithms with optimal path complexity in terms of a guaranteed approximation error are known for many regularized learning problems. That is not the case for kernel hyperparameter path tracking algorithms, where the exact path tracking algorithms can also suffer from numerical problems. Here we address this problem by devising a robust and efficient path tracking algorithm that can also handle kernel hyperparameter paths. The algorithm has asymptotically optimal complexity. We use this algorithm to compute approximate kernel hyperparamter solution paths for support vector machines and robust kernel regression. Experimental results for these problems applied to various data sets confirm the theoretical complexity analysis.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Transfer learning algorithms are used when one has sufficient training data for one supervised learning task (the source task) but only very limited training data for a second task (the target task) that is similar but not identical to the first. These algorithms use varying assumptions about the similarity between the tasks to carry information from the source to the target task. Common assumptions are that only certain specific marginal or conditional distributions have changed while all else remains the same. Alternatively, if one has only the target task, but also has the ability to choose a limited amount of additional training data to collect, then active learning algorithms are used to make choices which will most improve performance on the target task. These algorithms may be combined into active transfer learning, but previous efforts have had to apply the two methods in sequence or use restrictive transfer assumptions.We propose two transfer learning algorithms that allow changes in all marginal and conditional distributions but assume the changes are smooth in order to achieve transfer between the tasks. We then propose an active learning algorithm for the second method that yields a combined active transfer learning algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithms on synthetic functions and a real-world task on estimating the yield of vineyards from images of the grapes.},

abstract = {We consider the infinite-horizon discounted optimal control problem formalized by Markov Decision Processes. We focus on several approximate variations of the Policy Iteration algorithm: Approximate Policy Iteration (API) (Bertsekas &amp; Tsitsiklis, 1996), Conservative Policy Iteration (CPI) (Kakade &amp; Langford, 2002), a natural adaptation of the Policy Search by Dynamic Programming algorithm (Bagnell et al., 2003) to the infinite-horizon case (PSDP∞), and the recently proposed Non-Stationary Policy Iteration (NSPI(m)) (Scherrer &amp; Lesner, 2012). For all algorithms, we describe performance bounds with respect the per-iteration error ε, and make a comparison by paying a particular attention to the concentrability constants involved, the number of iterations and the memory required. Our analysis highlights the following points: 1) The performance guarantee of CPI can be arbitrarily better than that of API, but this comes at the cost of a relative--exponential in 1/ε increase of the number of iterations. 2) PSDP1 enjoys the best of both worlds: its performance guarantee is similar to that of CPI, but within a number of iterations similar to that of API. 3) Contrary to API that requires a constant memory, the memory needed by CPI and PSDP∞ is proportional to their number of iterations, which may be problematic when the discount factor γ is close to 1 or the approximation error ε is close to 0; we show that the NSPI(m) algorithm allows to make an overall trade-off between memory and performance. Simulations with these schemes confirm our analysis.},

abstract = {Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is an efficient approximation algorithm for computing sparse representations. However, prior research has shown that the representations computed by OMP may be of inferior quality, as they deliver suboptimal classification accuracy on several image datasets. We have found that this problem is caused by OMP's relatively weak stability under data variations, which leads to unreliability in supervised classifier training. We show that by imposing a simple nonnegativity constraint, this nonnegative variant of OMP (NOMP) can mitigate OMP's stability issue and is resistant to noise overfitting. In this work, we provide extensive analysis and experimental results to examine and validate the stability advantage of NOMP. In our experiments, we use a multi-layer deep architecture for representation learning, where we use K-means for feature learning and NOMP for representation encoding. The resulting learning framework is not only efficient and scalable to large feature dictionaries, but also is robust against input noise. This framework achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on the STL-10 dataset.},

abstract = {This paper derives sample complexity results for using Gaussian Processes (GPs) in both modelbased and model-free reinforcement learning (RL). We show that GPs are KWIK learnable, proving for the first time that a model-based RL approach using GPs, GP-Rmax, is sample efficient (PAC-MDP). However, we then show that previous approaches to model-free RL using GPs take an exponential number of steps to find an optimal policy, and are therefore not sample efficient. The third and main contribution is the introduction of a model-free RL algorithm using GPs, DGPQ, which is sample efficient and, in contrast to model-based algorithms, capable of acting in real time, as demonstrated on a fivedimensional aircraft simulator.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Algorithms that can efficiently recover principal components in very high-dimensional, streaming, and/or distributed data settings have become an important topic in the literature. In this paper, we propose an approach to principal component estimation that utilizes projections onto very sparse random vectors with Bernoulli-generated nonzero entries. Indeed, our approach is simultaneously efficient in memory/storage space, efficient in computation, and produces accurate PC estimates, while also allowing for rigorous theoretical performance analysis. Moreover, one can tune the sparsity of the random vectors deliberately to achieve a desired point on the tradeoffs between memory, computation, and accuracy. We rigorously characterize these tradeoffs and provide statistical performance guarantees. In addition to these very sparse random vectors, our analysis also applies to more general random projections. We present experimental results demonstrating that this approach allows for simultaneously achieving a substantial reduction of the computational complexity and memory/storage space, with little loss in accuracy, particularly for very high-dimensional data.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {High-level skills relieve planning algorithms from low-level details. But when the skills are poorly designed for the domain, the resulting plan may be severely suboptimal. Sutton et al. (1999) made an important step towards resolving this problem by introducing a rule that automatically improves a set of skills called options. This rule terminates an option early whenever switching to another option gives a higher value than continuing with the current option. However, they only analyzed the case where the improvement rule is applied once. We show conditions where this rule converges to the optimal set of options. A new interrupting Bellman operator that simultaneously improves the set of options is at the core of our analysis. One problem with the update rule is that it tends to favor lower-level skills. We introduce a regularization term that favors longer duration skills. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can derive a good set of high-level skills even when the original set of skills cannot solve the problem.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Semi-supervised learning, which uses unlabeled data to help learn a discriminative model, is especially important for structured output problems, as considerably more effort is needed to label its multi-dimensional outputs versus standard single output problems. We propose a new max-margin framework for semi-supervised structured output learning, that allows the use of powerful discrete optimization algorithms and high order regularizers defined directly on model predictions for the unlabeled examples. We show that our framework is closely related to Posterior Regularization, and the two frameworks optimize special cases of the same objective. The new framework is instantiated on two image segmentation tasks, using both a graph regularizer and a cardinality regularizer. Experiments also demonstrate that this framework can utilize unlabeled data from a different source than the labeled data to significantly improve performance while saving labeling effort.},

In contrast to these traditional methods, recently developed learning algorithms based upon the method of moments are both computationally efficient and provide strong statistical guarantees. In this work we provide a unified presentation and empirical comparison of three general moment-based methods in the context of modelling stochastic languages. By rephrasing these methods upon a common theoretical ground, introducing novel theoretical results where necessary, we provide a clear comparison, making explicit the statistical assumptions upon which each method relies. With this theoretical grounding, we then provide an in-depth empirical analysis of the methods on both real and synthetic data with the goal of elucidating performance trends and highlighting important implementation details.},

In this paper we propose novel variational inference for important sequential case of ddCRP (seqddCRP) by revealing its connection with Laplacian of random graph constructed by the process. We develop efficient algorithm for optimizing variational lower bound and demonstrate its efficiency comparing to Gibbs sampler. We also apply our variational approximation to CRP-equivalent seqddCRP-mixture model, where it could be considered as alternative to one based on truncated stick-breaking representation. This allowed us to achieve significantly better variational lower bound than variational approximation based on truncated stick breaking for Dirichlet process.},

Most often in network analysis, the edges are given. However, in many systems it is difficult or impossible to measure the network directly. Examples of latent networks include economic interactions linking financial instruments and patterns of reciprocity in gang violence. In these cases, we are limited to noisy observations of events associated with each node. To enable analysis of these implicit networks, we develop a probabilistic model that combines mutually-exciting point processes with random graph models. We show how the Poisson superposition principle enables an elegant auxiliary variable formulation and a fully-Bayesian, parallel inference algorithm. We evaluate this new model empirically on several datasets.},

It is shown that earlier bootstrap procedures which worked in the i.i.d. case will fail for random processes, and an alternative consistent estimate of the p-values is proposed. Tests on artificial data and real-world forex data indicate that the new test procedure discovers dependence which is missed by linear approaches, while the earlier bootstrap procedure returns an elevated number of false positives.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Many latent factors of variation interact to generate sensory data; for example, pose, morphology and expression in face images. In this work, we propose to learn manifold coordinates for the relevant factors of variation and to model their joint interaction. Many existing feature learning algorithms focus on a single task and extract features that are sensitive to the task-relevant factors and invariant to all others. However, models that just extract a single set of invariant features do not exploit the relationships among the latent factors. To address this, we propose a higher-order Boltzmann machine that incorporates multiplicative interactions among groups of hidden units that each learn to encode a distinct factor of variation. Furthermore, we propose correspondence-based training strategies that allow effective disentangling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition and face verification performance on the Toronto Face Database. We also demonstrate disentangled features learned on the CMU Multi-PIE dataset.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {A standard technique for understanding underlying dependency structures among a set of variables posits a shared conditional probability distribution for the variables measured on individuals within a group. This approach is often referred to as module networks, where individuals are represented by nodes in a network, groups are termed modules, and the focus is on estimating the network structure among modules. However, estimation solely from node-specific variables can lead to spurious dependencies, and unverifiable structural assumptions are often used for regularization. Here, we propose an extended model that leverages direct observations about the network in addition to node-specific variables. By integrating complementary data types, we avoid the need for structural assumptions. We illustrate theoretical and practical significance of the model and develop a reversible-jump MCMC learning procedure for learning modules and model parameters. We demonstrate the method accuracy in predicting modular structures from synthetic data and capability to learn regulatory modules in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene regulatory network.},

abstract = {Partial canonical correlation analysis (partial CCA) is a statistical method that estimates a pair of linear projections onto a low dimensional space, where the correlation between two multi-dimensional variables is maximized after eliminating the influence of a third variable. Partial CCA is known to be closely related to a causality measure between two time series. However, partial CCA requires the inverses of covariance matrices, so the calculation is not stable. This is particularly the case for high-dimensional data or small sample sizes. Additionally, we cannot estimate the optimal dimension of the subspace in the model. In this paper, we have addressed these problems by proposing a probabilistic interpretation of partial CCA and deriving a Bayesian estimation method based on the probabilistic model. Our numerical experiments demonstrated that our methods can stably estimate the model parameters, even in high dimensions or when there are a small number of samples.},

abstract = {Denoising auto-encoders (DAEs) have been successfully used to learn new representations for a wide range of machine learning tasks. During training, DAEs make many passes over the training dataset and reconstruct it from partial corruption generated from a pre-specified corrupting distribution. This process learns robust representation, though at the expense of requiring many training epochs, in which the data is explicitly corrupted. In this paper we present the marginalized Denoising Auto-encoder (mDAE), which (approximately) marginalizes out the corruption during training. Effectively, the mDAE takes into account infinitely many corrupted copies of the training data in every epoch, and therefore is able to match or outperform the DAE with much fewer training epochs. We analyze our proposed algorithm and show that it can be understood as a classic auto-encoder with a special form of regularization. In empirical evaluations we show that it attains 1-2 order-of-magnitude speedup in training time over other competing approaches.},

We theoretically analyze the performance guarantee of the multi-stage framework and give examples on how to design instances of MULTGREED for a broad range of natural submodular functions.

We complement our theory by empirically evaluating on several real-world problems, including data subset selection on millions of speech samples where MULTGREED yields at least a thousand times speedup and superior results over the state-of-the-art selection methods.},

Matrix factorization models exhibit state-of-the-art predictive performance in collaborative filtering. However, these models usually assume that the data is missing at random (MAR), and this is rarely the case. For example, the data is not MAR if users rate items they like more than ones they dislike. When the MAR assumption is incorrect, inferences are biased and predictive performance can suffer. Therefore, we model both the generative process for the data and the missing data mechanism. By learning these two models jointly we obtain improved performance over state-of-the-art methods when predicting the ratings and when modeling the data observation process. We present the first viable MF model for MNAR data. Our results are promising and we expect that further research on NMAR models will yield large gains in collaborative filtering.},

Our model therefore integrates the problem of prediction with expert advice with the stateful formalisms of reinforcement learning. Traditional no-regret learning approaches no longer apply, but we propose a simple algorithm that provably achieves no-regret when the state space is any convex Euclidean region. Our algorithm combines techniques from online learning with results from the literature on pursuit-evasion games. We describe a natural quantitative trading application in which the convex region captures inventory risk constraints, and local moves limit market impact. Using historical market data, we show experimentally that our algorithm has a strong advantage over classic noregret approaches.},

From an algebraic perspective, we show that its normalized Laplacian, denoted as the f -adjusted Laplacian, represents a natural family of diagonal perturbations of the original normalized Laplacian.

Theoretically, RP converges linearly under mild conditions and experimental results show that it substantially outperforms existing methods when applied to large-scale and ill-conditioned matrices.},

title = {Online Stochastic Optimization under Correlated Bandit Feedback},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of online stochastic optimization of a locally smooth function under bandit feedback. We introduce the high-confidence tree (HCT) algorithm, a novel anytime χ-armed bandit algorithm, and derive regret bounds matching the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the dependency on number of steps and the near-optimality dimension. The main advantage of HCT is that it handles the challenging case of correlated bandit feedback (reward), whereas existing methods require rewards to be conditionally independent. HCT also improves on the state-of-the-art in terms of the memory requirement, as well as requiring a weaker smoothness assumption on the mean-reward function in comparison with the existing anytime algorithms. Finally, we discuss how HCT can be applied to the problem of policy search in reinforcement learning and we report preliminary empirical results.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We study the graph clustering problem where each observation (edge or no-edge between a pair of nodes) may have a different level of confidence/ uncertainty. We propose a clustering algorithm that is based on optimizing an appropriate weighted objective, where larger weights are given to observations with lower uncertainty. Our approach leads to a convex optimization problem that is efficiently solvable. We analyze our approach under a natural generative model, and establish theoretical guarantees for recovering the underlying clusters. Our main result is a general theorem that applies to any given weight and distribution for the uncertainty. By optimizing over the weights, we derive a provably optimal weighting scheme, which matches the information theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors and leads to strong performance bounds in several specific settings. By optimizing over the uncertainty distribution, we show that nonuniform uncertainties can actually help. In particular, if the graph is built by spending a limited amount of resource to take measurement on each node pair, then it is beneficial to allocate the resource in a non-uniform fashion to obtain accurate measurements on a few pairs of nodes, rather than obtaining inaccurate measurements on many pairs. We provide simulation results that validate our theoretical findings.},

abstract = {Natural gradient ascent (NGA) is a popular optimization method that uses a positive definite metric tensor. In many applications the metric tensor is only guaranteed to be positive semidefinite (e.g., when using the Fisher information matrix as the metric tensor), in which case NGA is not applicable. In our first contribution, we derive generalized natural gradient ascent (GeNGA), a generalization of NGA which allows for positive semidefinite non-smooth metric tensors. In our second contribution we show that, in standard settings, GeNGA and NGA can both be divergent. We then establish sufficient conditions to ensure that both achieve various forms of convergence. In our third contribution we show how several reinforcement learning methods that use NGA without positive definite metric tensors can be adapted to properly use GeNGA.},

abstract = {We propose a Bayesian framework for recursively estimating the classifier weights in online learning of a classifier ensemble. In contrast with past methods, such as stochastic gradient descent or online boosting, our framework estimates the weights in terms of evolving posterior distributions. For a specified class of loss functions, we show that it is possible to formulate a suitably defined likelihood function and hence use the posterior distribution as an approximation to the global empirical loss minimizer. If the stream of training data is sampled from a stationary process, we can also show that our framework admits a superior rate of convergence to the expected loss minimizer than is possible with standard stochastic gradient descent. In experiments with real-world datasets, our formulation often performs better than online boosting algorithms.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The Collective Graphical Model (CGM) models a population of independent and identically distributed individuals when only collective statistics (i.e., counts of individuals) are observed. Exact inference in CGMs is intractable, and previous work has explored Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MAP approximations for learning and inference. This paper studies Gaussian approximations to the CGM. As the population grows large, we show that the CGM distribution converges to a multivariate Gaussian distribution (GCGM) that maintains the conditional independence properties of the original CGM. If the observations are exact marginals of the CGM or marginals that are corrupted by Gaussian noise, inference in the GCGM approximation can be computed efficiently in closed form. If the observations follow a different noise model (e.g., Poisson), then expectation propagation provides efficient and accurate approximate inference. The accuracy and speed of GCGM inference is compared to the MCMC and MAP methods on a simulated bird migration problem. The GCGM matches or exceeds the accuracy of the MAP method while being significantly faster.},

However, only limited theoretical analysis has been dedicated to this approach. In this paper, we analyze Empirical Risk Minimizing learners that use the superset error as the empirical risk measure. SLL data can arise either in the form of independent instances or as multiple-instance bags. For both scenarios, we give the conditions for ERM learnability and sample complexity for the realizable case.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (RTRBM) is a probabilistic time-series model. The topology of the RTRBM graphical model, however, assumes full connectivity between all the pairs of visible units and hidden units, thereby ignoring the dependency structure within the observations. Learning this structure has the potential for not only improving the prediction performance, but also revealing important dependency patterns in the data. For example, given a meteorological dataset, we could identify regional weather patterns. In this work, we propose a new class of RTRBM, which we refer to as the structured RTRBM (SRTRBM), which explicitly uses a graph to model the dependency structure. Our technique is related to methods such as graphical lasso, which are used to learn the topology of Gaussian graphical models. We also develop a spike-and-slab version of the RTRBM, and combine it with the SRTRBM to learn dependency structures in datasets with real-valued observations. Our experimental results using synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the SRTRBM can significantly improve the prediction performance of the RTRBM, particularly when the number of visible units is large and the size of the training set is small. It also reveals the dependency structures underlying our benchmark datasets.},

The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, since the RKHS moves can be integrated out analytically: our proposal distribution in the original space is a normal distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current sample lies in the support of the target distribution, and adapts to its local covariance structure. Furthermore, the procedure requires neither gradients nor any other higher order information about the target, making it particularly attractive for contexts such as Pseudo-Marginal MCMC. Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings outperforms competing fixed and adaptive samplers on multivariate, highly nonlinear target distributions, arising in both real-world and synthetic examples.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Bayesian optimization has proven to be a highly effective methodology for the global optimization of unknown, expensive and multimodal functions. The ability to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in "log-space," to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling methods provide a mechanism for defining distant proposals with high acceptance probabilities in a Metropolis-Hastings framework, enabling more efficient exploration of the state space than standard random-walk proposals. The popularity of such methods has grown significantly in recent years. However, a limitation of HMC methods is the required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system--such computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size or streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed from a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a stochastic gradient HMC approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of the stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we introduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction term that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the desired target distribution as the invariant distribution. Results on simulated data validate our theory. We also provide an application of our methods to a classification task using neural networks and to online Bayesian matrix factorization.},

In this paper, we propose an asynchronous ADMM algorithm by using two conditions to control the asynchrony: partial barrier and bounded delay. The proposed algorithm has a simple structure and good convergence guarantees (its convergence rate can be reduced to that of its synchronous counterpart). Experiments on different distributed ADMM applications show that asynchrony reduces the time on network waiting, and achieves faster convergence than its synchronous counterpart in terms of the wall clock time.},

We show that learning can be done tractably, even when the weight matrix is stretched to infinity, for some specific models. We also study tractable algorithms for implementing stretching in deep convolutional architectures in an iterative manner and derive bounds for its convergence. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed stretched deep convolutional networks are capable of achieving good performance for many object recognition tasks. More importantly, for a fixed network architecture, one can achieve much better accuracy using stretching rather than learning the weights using backpropagation.},

To learn these representations we introduce nested dropout, a procedure for stochastically removing coherent nested sets of hidden units in a neural network. We first present a sequence of theoretical results for the special case of a semilinear autoencoder. We rigorously show that the application of nested dropout enforces identifiability of the units, which leads to an exact equivalence with PCA. We then extend the algorithm to deep models and demonstrate the relevance of ordered representations to a number of applications. Specifically, we use the ordered property of the learned codes to construct hash-based data structures that permit very fast retrieval, achieving retrieval in time logarithmic in the database size and independent of the dimensionality of the representation. This allows codes that are hundreds of times longer than currently feasible for retrieval. We therefore avoid the diminished quality associated with short codes, while still performing retrieval that is competitive in speed with existing methods. We also show that ordered representations are a promising way to learn adaptive compression for efficient online data reconstruction.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We present a new model for prediction markets, in which we use risk measures to model agents and introduce a market maker to describe the trading process. This specific choice of modelling approach enables us to show that the whole market approaches a global objective, despite the fact that the market is designed such that each agent only cares about its own goal. In addition, the market dynamic provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective. An intimate connection between machine learning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse a market by applying machine learning methods to the global objective; and 2) solve machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian networks and neural networks with stochastic hidden units are commonly perceived as two separate types of models. We show that either of these types of models can often be transformed into an instance of the other, by switching between centered and differentiable non-centered parameterizations of the latent variables. The choice of parameterization greatly influences the efficiency of gradient-based posterior inference; we show that they are often complementary to eachother, we clarify when each parameterization is preferred and show how inference can be made robust. In the noncentered form, a simple Monte Carlo estimator of the marginal likelihood can be used for learning the parameters. Theoretical results are supported by experiments.},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Highly expressive directed latent variable models, such as sigmoid belief networks, are difficult to train on large datasets because exact inference in them is intractable and none of the approximate inference methods that have been applied to them scale well. We propose a fast non-iterative approximate inference method that uses a feedforward network to implement efficient exact sampling from the variational posterior. The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator of the inference network gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques. Applying our approach to training sigmoid belief networks and deep autoregressive networks, we show that it outperforms the wake-sleep algorithm on MNIST and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Reuters RCV1 document dataset.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We present a scalable Bayesian framework for low-rank decomposition of multiway tensor data with missing observations. The key issue of pre-specifying the rank of the decomposition is sidestepped in a principled manner using a multiplicative gamma process prior. Both continuous and binary data can be analyzed under the framework, in a coherent way using fully conjugate Bayesian analysis. In particular, the analysis in the non-conjugate binary case is facilitated via the use of the P\'{o}lya-Gamma sampling strategy which elicits closed-form Gibbs sampling updates. The resulting samplers are efficient and enable us to apply our framework to large-scale problems, with time-complexity that is linear in the number of observed entries in the tensor. This is especially attractive in analyzing very large but sparsely observed tensors with very few known entries. Moreover, our method admits easy extension to the supervised setting where entities in one or more tensor modes have labels. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art tensor decomposition methods on various synthetic and benchmark real-world datasets.},

abstract = {We define the beta diffusion tree, a random tree structure with a set of leaves that defines a collection of overlapping subsets of objects, known as a feature allocation. The generative process for the tree is defined in terms of particles (representing the objects) diffusing in some continuous space, analogously to the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor diffusion trees (Neal, 2003b; Knowles &amp; Ghahramani, 2011), both of which define tree structures over clusters of the particles. With the beta diffusion tree, however, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse to multiple locations in the continuous space, resulting in (a random number of) possibly overlapping clusters of the objects. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conclude with several numerical experiments on missing data problems with data sets of gene expression arrays, international development statistics, and intranational socioeconomic measurements.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Distributed word representations have recently been proven to be an invaluable resource for NLP. These representations are normally learned using neural networks and capture syntactic and semantic information about words. Information about word morphology and shape is normally ignored when learning word representations. However, for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, intra-word information is extremely useful, specially when dealing with morphologically rich languages. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that learns character-level representation of words and associate them with usual word representations to perform POS tagging. Using the proposed approach, while avoiding the use of any handcrafted feature, we produce state-of-the-art POS taggers for two languages: English, with 97.32% accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus; and Portuguese, with 97.47% accuracy on the Mac-Morpho corpus, where the latter represents an error reduction of 12.2% on the best previous known result.},

More specifically, we show that a BSPP-based approach provides either a linear classifier or an ε-infeasibility certificate. We show that the accelerated primal-dual algorithm, Mirror Prox, can be used for this purpose and achieves the best known convergence rate of O(√log n/ρ(A))(O(√log n/ε)), which is almost independent of the problem size, n. Our framework also solves kernelized and conic versions of the problem, with the same rate of convergence. We support our theoretical findings with an empirical study on synthetic and real data, highlighting the efficiency and numerical stability of our algorithm, especially on large-scale instances.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Traditional distance metric learning with side information usually formulates the objectives using the covariance matrices of the data point pairs in the two constraint sets of must-links and cannot-links. Because the covariance matrix computes the sum of the squared l2-norm distances, it is prone to both outlier samples and outlier features. To develop a robust distance metric learning method, we propose a new objective for distance metric learning using the l1-norm distances. The resulted objective is challenging to solve, because it simultaneously minimizes and maximizes (minmax) a number of nonsmooth l1-norm terms. As an important theoretical contribution of this paper, we systematically derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the general l1-norm minmax problem. We performed extensive empirical evaluations, where our new distance metric learning method outperforms related state-of-the-art methods in a variety of experimental settings.},

Stochastic variational inference (SVI) provides a new framework for approximating model posteriors with only a small number of passes through the data, enabling such models to be fit at scale. However, its application to time series models has not been studied.In this paper we develop SVI algorithms for several common Bayesian time series models, namely the hidden Markov model (HMM), hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM), and the non-parametric HDP-HMM and HDP-HSMM. In addition, because HSMM inference can be expensive even in the minibatch setting of SVI, we develop fast approximate updates for HSMMs with durations distributions that are negative binomials or mixtures of negative binomials.},

title = {A Clockwork RNN},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.},

Specifically, we use tensor factorization to reveal information about the hidden variables. This allows us to construct convex likelihoods which can be globally optimized to recover the parameters.},

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {The problem of low-rank matrix completion has recently generated a lot of interest leading to several results that offer exact solutions to the problem. However, in order to do so, these methods make assumptions that can be quite restrictive in practice. More specifically, the methods assume that: a) the observed indices are sampled uniformly at random, and b) for every new matrix, the observed indices are sampled afresh. In this work, we address these issues by providing a universal recovery guarantee for matrix completion that works for a variety of sampling schemes. In particular, we show that if the set of sampled indices come from the edges of a bipartite graph with large spectral gap (i.e. gap between the first and the second singular value), then the nuclear norm minimization based method exactly recovers all low-rank matrices that satisfy certain incoherence properties. Moreover, we also show that under certain stricter incoherence conditions, O(nr2) uniformly sampled entries are enough to recover any rank-r n \texttimes{} n matrix, in contrast to the O(nr log n) sample complexity required by other matrix completion algorithms as well as existing analyses of the nuclear norm method.},

In this work, we develop a new algorithm for DkS that searches a low-dimensional space for provably dense subgraphs. Our algorithm comes with novel performance bounds that depend on the graph spectrum. Our graph-dependent bounds are surprisingly tight for real-world graphs where we find subgraphs with density provably within 70% of the optimum. These guarantees are significantly tighter than the best available worst case a priori bounds.Our algorithm runs in nearly linear time, under spectral assumptions satisfied by most graphs found in applications. Moreover, it is highly scalable and parallelizable. We demonstrate this by implementing it in MapReduce and executing numerous experiments on massive real-world graphs that have up to billions of edges. We empirically show that our algorithm can find subgraphs of significantly higher density compared to the previous state of the art.},

abstract = {We study the effectiveness of learning low degree polynomials using neural networks by the gradient descent method. While neural networks have been shown to have great expressive power, and gradient descent has been widely used in practice for learning neural networks, few theoretical guarantees are known for such methods. In particular, it is well known that gradient descent can get stuck at local minima, even for simple classes of target functions. In this paper, we present several positive theoretical results to support the effectiveness of neural networks. We focus on twolayer neural networks where the bottom layer is a set of non-linear hidden nodes, and the top layer node is a linear function, similar to Barron (1993). First we show that for a randomly initialized neural network with sufficiently many hidden units, the generic gradient descent algorithm learns any low degree polynomial, assuming we initialize the weights randomly. Secondly, we show that if we use complex-valued weights (the target function can still be real), then under suitable conditions, there are no "robust local minima": the neural network can always escape a local minimum by performing a random perturbation. This property does not hold for real-valued weights. Thirdly, we discuss whether sparse polynomials can be learned with small neural networks, with the size dependent on the sparsity of the target function.},

title = {Exponential Family Matrix Completion under Structural Constraints},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We consider the matrix completion problem of recovering a structured matrix from noisy and partial measurements. Recent works have proposed tractable estimators with strong statistical guarantees for the case where the underlying matrix is low-rank, and the measurements consist of a subset, either of the exact individual entries, or of the entries perturbed by additive Gaussian noise, which is thus implicitly suited for thin-tailed continuous data. Arguably, common applications of matrix completion require estimators for (a) heterogeneous data-types, such as skewed-continuous, count, binary, etc., (b) for heterogeneous noise models (beyond Gaussian), which capture varied uncertainty in the measurements, and (c) heterogeneous structural constraints beyond low-rank, such as block-sparsity, or a superposition structure of low-rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others. In this paper, we provide a vastly unified framework for generalized matrix completion by considering a matrix completion setting wherein the matrix entries are sampled from any member of the rich family of exponential family distributions; and impose general structural constraints on the underlying matrix, as captured by a general regularizer R(.). We propose a simple convex regularized M-estimator for the generalized framework, and provide a unified and novel statistical analysis for this general class of estimators. We finally corroborate our theoretical results on simulated datasets.},

title = {GEV-Canonical Regression for Accurate Binary Class Probability Estimation When One Class is Rare},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We consider the problem of binary class probability estimation (CPE) when one class is rare compared to the other. It is well known that standard algorithms such as logistic regression do not perform well in this setting as they tend to underestimate the probability of the rare class. Common fixes include under-sampling and weighting, together with various correction schemes. Recently, Wang &amp; Dey (2010) suggested the use of a parametrized family of asymmetric link functions based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, which has been used for modeling rare events in statistics. The approach showed promising initial results, but combined with the logarithmic CPE loss implicitly used in their work, it results in a non-convex composite loss that is difficult to optimize. In this paper, we use tools from the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid &amp; Williamson, 2010) to construct a canonical underlying CPE loss corresponding to the GEV link, which yields a convex proper composite loss that we call the GEV-canonical loss; this loss can be tailored to CPE settings where one class is rare, and is easily minimized using an IRLS-type algorithm similar to that used for logistic regression. Our experiments on both synthetic and real data suggest that the resulting algorithm - which we term GEV-canonical regression - performs well compared to common approaches such as undersampling and weights-correction for this problem.},

title = {A Reversible Infinite HMM Using Normalised Random Measures},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {We present a nonparametric prior over reversible Markov chains. We use completely random measures, specifically gamma processes, to construct a countably infinite graph with weighted edges. By enforcing symmetry to make the edges undirected we define a prior over random walks on graphs that results in a reversible Markov chain. The resulting prior over infinite transition matrices is closely related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but enforces reversibility. A reinforcement scheme has recently been proposed with similar properties, but the de Finetti measure is not well characterised. We take the alternative approach of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive distribution. We use our process to construct a reversible infinite HMM which we apply to two real datasets, one from epigenomics and one ion channel recording.},

title = {Structured Low-Rank Matrix Factorization: Optimality, Algorithm and Applications to Image Processing},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Recently, convex solutions to low-rank matrix factorization problems have received increasing attention in machine learning. However, in many applications the data can display other structures beyond simply being low-rank. For example, images and videos present complex spatio-temporal structures, which are largely ignored by current low-rank methods. In this paper we explore a matrix factorization technique suitable for large datasets that captures additional structure in the factors by using a projective tensor norm, which includes classical image regularizers such as total variation and the nuclear norm as particular cases. Although the resulting optimization problem is not convex, we show that under certain conditions on the factors, any local minimizer for the factors yields a global minimizer for their product. Examples in biomedical video segmentation and hyperspectral compressed recovery show the advantages of our approach on high-dimensional datasets.},

title = {Influence Function Learning in Information Diffusion Networks},
year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Can we learn the influence of a set of people in a social network from cascades of information diffusion? This question is often addressed by a two-stage approach: first learn a diffusion model, and then calculate the influence based on the learned model. Thus, the success of this approach relies heavily on the correctness of the diffusion model which is hard to verify for real world data. In this paper, we exploit the insight that the influence functions in many diffusion models are coverage functions, and propose a novel parameterization of such functions using a convex combination of random basis functions. Moreover, we propose an efficient maximum likelihood based algorithm to learn such functions directly from cascade data, and hence bypass the need to specify a particular diffusion model in advance. We provide both theoretical and empirical analysis for our approach, showing that the proposed approach can provably learn the influence function with low sample complexity, be robust to the unknown diffusion models, and significantly outperform existing approaches in both synthetic and real world data.},
