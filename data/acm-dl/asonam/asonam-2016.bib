abstract = {The development of Internet and social networks has provided more emerging network data which facilitates the dynamic network analysis. In this paper, we propose a new method to measure coherence strength, also referred to as community consistency, of a community under dynamic settings. In order to better interpret the influence of evolving community structure on community consistency, we model the problem as one of influence propagation processes having a causal relation with the community consistency. To this effect a generative model is proposed to combine the influence propagation and the network topological structure at each time stamp. Our comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in estimating the community consistency.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Most of the online news media outlets rely heavily on the revenues generated from the clicks made by their readers, and due to the presence of numerous such outlets, they need to compete with each other for reader attention. To attract the readers to click on an article and subsequently visit the media site, the outlets often come up with catchy headlines accompanying the article links, which lure the readers to click on the link. Such headlines are known as Clickbaits. While these baits may trick the readers into clicking, in the long-run, clickbaits usually don't live up to the expectation of the readers, and leave them disappointed.In this work, we attempt to automatically detect clickbaits and then build a browser extension which warns the readers of different media sites about the possibility of being baited by such headlines. The extension also offers each reader an option to block clickbaits she doesn't want to see. Then, using such reader choices, the extension automatically blocks similar clickbaits during her future visits. We run extensive offline and online experiments across multiple media sites and find that the proposed clickbait detection and the personalized blocking approaches perform very well achieving 93% accuracy in detecting and 89% accuracy in blocking clickbaits.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The proliferation in size of actual graph datasets impels the use of distributed graph processing frameworks which in turn, should consider a good partitioning of the graph dataset in order to see their performances enhanced. In this paper, we focus on a well known heuristic for graph partitioning named METIS, an offline method giving high quality partitions but unsuitable for processing large graphs due to the offline setting. A recently proposed alternative is the streaming partitioning heuristics aiming to alleviate the computational resources constraints when dealing with large graphs. In considering this matter, we propose a new partitioning method that benefits from the accuracy of METIS and the lightness of the streaming setting. This work introduces the Streaming METIS Partitioning method (SMP) which is an online counterpart of METIS, a fast and well known multilevel heuristic for graph partitioning. We show in a complexity analysis that SMP has a lower time complexity compared to METIS, which is confirmed by conducted experiments. Moreover, we show that SMP yields competitive results to its offline counterpart METIS, especially when it is run on a Depth First Search streaming order. Also, when compared to other online competitors, SMP is the best performing heuristic giving partitions with minimal edge cut.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Spectral partitioning (clustering) algorithms use eigenvectors to solve network analysis problems. The relationship between numerical accuracy and network mining quality is insufficiently understood. We show that analyzing numerical accuracy and network mining quality together leads to an algorithmic improvement. Specifically, we study spectral partitioning using sweep cuts of approximate eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. We introduce a novel, theoretically sound, parameter free stopping criterion for iterative eigensolvers designed for graph partitioning. On a corpus of social networks, we validate this stopping criterion by showing the number of iterations is reduced by a factor of 4.15 on average, and the conductance is increased by only a factor of 1.24 on average. Regression analysis of these results shows that the decrease in the number of iterations needed is greater for problems with a small spectral gap, thus our stopping criterion helps more on harder problems. Experiments show that alternative stopping criteria are insufficient to ensure low conductance partitioning on real world networks. While our method guarantees partitions that satisfy the Cheeger Inequality, we find that it typically beats this guarantee on real world graphs.},

abstract = {Finding dense subgraphs in large graphs is a key primitive in a variety of real-world application domains, encompassing social network analysis, event detection, problems arising in biology and many others. Several recent works have studied some variants of the classical densest subgraph problem, considering alternative quality measures such as the average number of triangles in the subgraphs and their compactness. Those are desirable properties when the task is to find communities or interesting events in social networks.In our work, we capitalize on previous works and study a variant of the problem where we aim at finding subgraphs which are both compact and contain a large number of triangles. We provide a formal definition for our problem, while developing efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. Our experimental evaluation on large real-world networks shows the effectiveness of our approach.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Extracting dense subgraphs is an important step in many graph related applications. There is a challenging struggle in exploring the tradeoffs between density and size in subgraphs extracted. More often than not, different methods aim at different specific tradeoffs between the two factors. To the best of our knowledge, no existing method can allow a user to explore the full spectrum of the tradeoffs using a single parameter. In this paper, we investigate this problem systematically. First, since the existing studies cannot find highly compact dense subgraphs, we formulate the problem of finding very dense but relatively small subgraphs. Second, we connect our problem with the existing methods and propose a unified framework that can explore the tradeoffs between density and size of dense subgraphs extracted using a hyper-parameter. We give theoretical upper and lower bounds on the hyper-parameter so that the range where the unified framework can produce non-trivial subgraphs is determined. Third, we develop an efficient quadratic programming method for the unified framework, which is a generalization and extension to the existing methods. We show that optimizing the unified framework is essentially a relaxation of the maximization of a family of density functions. Last, we report a systematic empirical study to verify our findings.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social media users often find it difficult to make appropriate access control decisions which govern how they share their information with a potentially large audience on these platforms. Community detection algorithms have been previously put forth as a solution which can help users by automatically partitioning their friend network. These partitions can then be used by the user as a basis for making access control decisions. Previous works which leverage communities for enhancing access control mechanisms assume that members of the same community will have the same access to a user's content, but whether or to what extent this assumption is correct is a lingering question. In this paper, we empirically evaluate a goodness of fit between the communities created by implementing 8 community detection algorithms on the friend networks of users and the access control decisions made by them during a user study. We also analyze whether personal characteristics of the users or the nature of the content play a role in the performance of the algorithms. The results indicate that community detection algorithms may be useful for creating default access control policies for users who exhibit a relatively more static access control behaviour. For users showing great variation in their access control decisions across the board (both in terms of number and actual members), we found that community detection algorithms performed poorly.},

In our experiments using urban streets of six cities, we show that our proposed method achieved a reasonably high acceleration performance. Then, we show that functional cluster produced by our method are useful for understanding the properties of areas in a series of visualization results.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the problem of network completion by considering the similarities between the node attributes. Given a sample of observed nodes with their incident edges, how can we efficiently reconstruct the network by completing the missing edges of unobserved nodes? Apart from the missing edges, in real settings the node attributes may be partially missing, as well as they may introduce noise when completing the network. We propose a network completion method based on joint clustering and similarity learning. The proposed approach differs from competitive strategies, which consider attribute-based similarities at the node-level. First we generate clusters based on the node attributes, thus reducing the noise and the sparsity in the case that the attributes may be missing. We design a joint objective function to jointly factorize the adjacency matrix of the observed edges with the cluster-based similarities of the node attributes, while at the same time the clusters are adapted, accordingly. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to solve the network completion problem via alternating minimization. Our experiments on two real world social networks from Facebook and Google+ show that the proposed approach achieves high completion accuracy, compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we evaluate the effect of noise on community scoring and centrality-based parameters with respect to two different aspects of network analysis: (i) sensitivity, that is how the parameter value changes as edges are removed and (ii) reliability in the context of message spreading, that is how the time taken to broadcast a message changes as edges are removed.Our experiments on synthetic and real-world networks and three different noise models demonstrate that for both the aspects over all networks and all noise models, permanence qualifies as the most effective metric. For the sensitivity experiments closeness centrality is a close second. For the message spreading experiments, closeness and betweenness centrality based initiator selection closely competes with permanence. This is because permanence has a dual characteristic where the cumulative permanence over all vertices is sensitive to noise but the ids of the top-rank vertices, which are used to find seeds during message spreading remain relatively stable under noise.},

abstract = {Given a set AL of community detection algorithms and a graph G as inputs, we propose two ensemble methods EnDisCo and MeDOC that (respectively) identify disjoint and overlapping communities in G. EnDisCo transforms a graph into a latent feature space by leveraging multiple base solutions and discovers disjoint community structure. MeDOC groups similar base communities into a meta-community and detects both disjoint and overlapping community structures. Experiments are conducted at different scales on both synthetically generated networks as well as on several real-world networks for which the underlying ground-truth community structure is available. Our extensive experiments show that both algorithms outperform state-of-the-art non-ensemble algorithms by a significant margin. Moreover, we compare EnDisCo and MeDOC with a recent ensemble method for disjoint community detection and show that our approaches achieve superior performance. To the best of our knowledge, MeDOC is the first ensemble approach for overlapping community detection.},

abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental task in social network analysis.

Next, we develop three Nonnegative Matrix Factorization frameworks to investigate the contributions of different types of user connectivity and content information in community detection. We show that user content and endorsement filtered connectivity information are complementary to each other in clustering politically motivated users into pure political communities. Word usage is the strongest indicator of users' political orientation among all content categories. Incorporating user-word matrix and word similarity regularizer provides the missing link in connectivity-only methods which suffer from detection of artificially large number of clusters for Twitter networks.},

Mobilization includes four stages: being sympathetic to the cause, being aware of the movement, motivation to take part and ability to participate. We suggest that expressions of mobilization in communications of individuals may be used to predict the approaching protest. We have utilized several Natural Language Processing techniques to create a methodology to identify mobilization in social media communication.Results of experimentation with Twitter data collected before and during the 2015 Baltimore events and the information on actual protests taken from news media show a correlation over time between volume of Twitter communications related to mobilization and occurrences of protest at certain geographical locations. We conclude with discussion of possible theoretical explanations and practical applications of these results.},

abstract = {Millions of microblogs are posted during disasters, which include not only information about the present situation, but also the emotions / opinions of the masses. While most of the prior research has been on extracting situational information, this work focuses on a particular type of non-situational tweets - communal tweets, i.e., abusive posts targeting specific religious / racial groups. We characterize the communal tweets posted during five recent disaster events, and the users who posted such tweets. We find that communal tweets are posted not only by common users, but also by many popular users (having tens of thousands of followers), most of whom are related to the media and politics. As a result, communal tweets get much higher exposure (retweets) than non-communal tweets. Further, users posting communal tweets form strong connected groups in the social network. Considering the potentially adverse effects of communal tweets during disasters, we also indicate a way to counter such tweets, by utilizing anti-communal tweets posted by some users during such events.},

Results showed that there was a strong anti-austerity sentiment accompanied with a critical view on European and Greek political actions.},

abstract = {We study the problem of synopsis construction of massive graph streams arriving in real-time. Many graphs such as those formed by the activity on social networks, communication networks, and telephone networks are defined dynamically as rapid edge streams on a massive domain of nodes. In these rapid and massive graph streams, it is often not possible to estimate the frequency of individual items (e.g., edges, nodes) with complete accuracy. Nevertheless, sketch-based stream summaries such as Count-Min can preserve frequency information of high-frequency items with a reasonable accuracy. However, these sketch summaries lose the underlying graph structure unless one keeps information about start and end nodes of all edges, which is prohibitively expensive. For example, the existing methods can identify the high-frequency nodes and edges, but they are unable to answer more complex structural queries such as reachability defined by high-frequency edges.To this end, we design a 3-dimensional sketch, gMatrix that summarizes massive graph streams in real-time, while also retaining information about the structural behavior of the underlying graph dataset. We demonstrate how gMatrix, coupled with a one-time reverse hash mapping, is able to estimate important structural properties, e.g., reachability over high frequency edges in an online manner and with theoretical performance guarantees. Our experimental results using large-scale graph streams attest that gMatrix is capable of answering both frequency-based and structural queries with high accuracy and efficiency.},

We conduct dominance analysis based on the canonical analysis of asymmetry that decomposes a square asymmetric matrix into two parts, a symmetric one and a skew-symmetric one, and then applies the singular value decomposition (SVD) on the skew-symmetric part. Each individual node can be projected as one 2-dimensional point based on its row values at each pair of successive singular vectors. The asymmetric relationship between two individuals can then be captured by areas of triangles formed from the two points and the origin in each 2-dimensional space. We quantify node dominance (submissive) score based on the relative position of the node's coordinate from coordinates of all other nodes it dominates (subdues) in the projected singular vector spaces. We conduct dominance/submissiveness analysis for several representative networks including perfect linear orderings, networks with tree structure, and networks with random graphs and examine the departures of a real social network from those representative graphs.

abstract = {Real-world network datasets are often incomplete. Subsequently, any analysis on such networks is likely to produce skewed results. We examine the following problem: given an incomplete network, which b nodes should be probed to bring as many new nodes as possible into the observed network? For instance, consider someone who has observed a portion (say 1%) of the Twitter network. How should she use a limited budget to reduce the incompleteness of the network? In this work, we propose a novel algorithm, called MaxReach, which uses a budget b to increase the number of nodes in the observed network. Our experiments, across a range of datasets and conditions, demonstrate the efficacy of MaxReach},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {People usually get involved in multiple social networks to enjoy new services or to fulfill their needs. Many new social networks try to attract users of other existing networks to increase the number of their users. Once a user (called source user) of a social network (called source network) joins a new social network (called target network), a new inter-network link (called anchor link) is formed between the source and target networks. In this paper, we concentrated on predicting the formation of such anchor links between heterogeneous social networks. Unlike conventional link prediction problems in which the formation of a link between two existing users within a single network is predicted, in anchor link prediction, the target user is missing and will be added to the target network once the anchor link is created. To solve this problem, we propose an effective general meta-path-based approach called Connector and Recursive Meta-Paths (CRMP). By using those two different categories of meta-paths, we model different aspects of social factors that may affect a source user to join the target network, resulting in the formation of a new anchor link. Extensive experiments on real-world heterogeneous social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the recent methods.},

That is, the hyperbolicity in graphs is, to some extent, a local property. Moreover, we show that this set is close to the graph's center.

abstract = {Being the anchor points for building social relationships in the cyber-space, online social networks (OSNs) play an integral part of modern peoples life. Since different OSNs are designed to address specific social needs, people take part in multiple OSNs to cover different facets of their life. While the fragmented pieces of information about a user in each OSN may be of limited use, serious privacy issues arise if a sophisticated adversary pieces information together from multiple OSNs. To this end, we undertake the role of such an adversary and demonstrate the possibility of "splicing" user profiles across multiple OSNs and present associated security risks to users. In doing so, we develop a scalable and systematic profile joining scheme, Splicer, that focuses on various aspects of profile attributes by simultaneously performing exact, quasi-perfect and partial matches between pairs of profiles. From our evaluations on three real OSN data, Splicer not only handles large-scale OSN profiles efficiently by saving 87% computation time compared to all-pair profile comparisons, but also far exceeds the recall of generic distance measure based approach at the same precision level by 33%. Finally, we quantify the amount of information "lift" attributed to joining of OSNs, where on average 22% additional profile attributes can be added to 24% of users.},

abstract = {Cyberbullying is a major problem affecting more than half of all American teens. Prior work has largely focused on detecting cyberbullying after the fact. In this paper, we investigate the prediction of cyberbullying incidents in Instagram, a popular media-based social network. The novelty of this work is building a predictor that can anticipate the occurrence of cyberbullying incidents before they happen. The Instagram media-based social network is well-suited to such prediction since there is an initial posting of an image typically with an associated text caption, followed later by the text comments that form the basis of a specific cyberbullying incident. We extract several important features from the initial posting data for automated cyberbullying prediction, including profanity and linguistic content of the text caption, image content, as well as social graph parameters and temporal content behavior. Evaluations using a real-world Instagram dataset demonstrate that our method achieves high performance in predicting the occurrence of cyberbullying incidents.},

We revisit the scope and definition of what is deemed as "malicious" in the modern day Internet, and identify 627 pages publishing untrustworthy information, misleading content, adult and child unsafe content, scams, etc. Our findings revealed that at least 8% of all malicious pages were dedicated to promote a single malicious domain. Studying the temporal posting activity of pages revealed that malicious pages were 1.4 times more active daily than benign pages. We further identified collusive behavior within a set of malicious pages spreading adult and pornographic content. Finally, we attempted to automate the process of detecting malicious Facebook pages by training multiple supervised learning algorithms on our dataset. Artificial neural networks trained on a fixed sized bag-of-words performed the best and achieved an accuracy of 84.13%.},

To mitigate the impact and reach of these malicious campaigns to targeted sites, we propose and evaluate a machine learning based classification approach for detecting malicious campaigns in crowdsourcing platforms as a first line of defense. Specifically, we (i) conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand the characteristics of malicious campaigns and legitimate campaigns in crowdsourcing platforms, (ii) propose various features to distinguish between malicious campaigns and legitimate campaigns, and (iii) evaluate a classification approach against baselines. Our experimental results show that our proposed approaches effectively detect malicious campaigns with low false negative and false positive rates.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) remain the focal point of Internet usage. Since the beginning, networking sites tried best to have right privacy mechanisms in place for users, enabling them to share the right content with the right audience. With all these efforts, privacy customizations remain hard for users across the sites. Existing research that address this problem mainly focus on semi-supervised strategies that introduce extra complexity by requiring the user to manually specify initial privacy preferences for their friends. In this work, we suggest an adaptive solution that can dynamically generate privacy labels for users in OSNs. To this end, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning framework that targets two key problems in OSNs like Facebook: the exposure of users' interactions through the network to less trusted direct friends, and the possibility of propagating user updates through direct friends' interactions to indirect friends. By implementing this framework, we aim at understanding how social trust and privacy could be correlated, specifically in a dynamic fashion. We report the ranked dependence between the generated privacy labels and the estimated user trust values, which indicate the ability of the framework to identify the highly trusted users and share with them higher percentages of data.},

abstract = {We address the problem of estimating core numbers of nodes by reading edges of a large graph stored in external memory. The core number of a node is the highest k-core in which the node participates. Core numbers are useful in many graph mining tasks, especially ones that involve finding communities of nodes, influential spreaders and dense subgraphs. Large graphs often do not fit on the memory of a single machine. Existing external memory solutions do not give bounds on the required space. In practice, existing solutions also do not scale with the size of the graph. We propose NimbleCore, an iterative external-memory algorithm, which estimates core numbers of nodes using O(n log dmax) space, where n is the number of nodes and dmax is the maximum node-degree in the graph. We also show that NimbleCore requires O(n) space for graphs with power-law degree distributions. Experiments on forty-eight large graphs from various domains demonstrate that NimbleCore gives space savings up to 60X, while accurately estimating core numbers with average relative error less than 2.3%.},

However, to control the epidemic-prone spread such as dengue fever, epidemiologists tend to deploy a cost-effective intervention with low outbreak risk, but the outbreak risk cannot be estimated based on the expectation of infected count. We in this paper explore the first solution to estimate the probability that can successfully bound the infected count below the out-of-control threshold, which can be logically mapped to the outbreak risk and can facilitate the authority to adaptively adjust the intervention cost for the need of risk control. We elaborate upon the proposed MCP (standing for Maximization of Containment Probability) problem and show that it is a NP-hard challenge without the submodular property. We further devise an effective measurement of sufficient number of Monte Carlo iterations based on the relative error of Monte Carol integration. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm with small iterations can deliver the qualified guarantee of containment probability, demonstrating its feasibility for real applications.},

abstract = {Social influence has attracted tremendous attention from both academic and industrial communities due to the rapid development of online social networks. While most research has been focused on the direct influence between peers, learning cascaded indirect influence has not been previously studied. In this paper, we formulate the concept of cascade indirect influence based on the Independent Cascade model and then propose a novel online learning algorithm for learning the cascaded influence in the partial monitoring setting. We propose two bandit algorithms E-EXP3 and RE-EXP3 to address this problem. We theoretically prove that E-EXP3 has a cumulative regret bound of [EQUATION] over T, the number of time stamps. We will also show that RE-EXP3, a relaxed version of E-EXP3, achieves a better performance in practice. We compare the proposed algorithms with three baseline methods on both synthetic and real networks (Weibo and AMiner). Our experimental results show that RE-EXP3 converges 100x faster than E-EXP3. Both of them significantly outperform the alternative methods in terms of normalized regret. Finally, we apply the learned cascaded influence to help behavior prediction and experiments show that our proposed algorithms can help achieve a significant improvement (10--15% by accuracy) for behavior prediction.},

abstract = {The participation inequality phenomenon in online social networks between the niche of super contributors and the crowd of silent users, a.k.a. lurkers, has been witnessed in many domains. Within this view, understanding the role that lurkers take in the network is essential to develop innovative strategies to delurk them, i.e., to engage such users into a more active participation in the social network life. In this work, we leverage the boundary spanning theory to enhance our understanding of lurking behaviors, with the goal of improving the task of delurking in social networks. Assuming the availability of a global community structure, we first analyze how lurkers are related to users that take the role of bridges between different communities, unveiling insights into the bridging nature of lurkers and their tendency to acquire information from outside their own community. Moreover, based on a targeted influence maximization method designed for delurking, we also analyze how the learning of users that can best engage lurkers is related to the community structure. We found that the best users to engage lurkers belonging to any particular community, are more often found outside that community, and more specifically they are located in the adjacent communities.},

Through extensive experiments over a sample of millions of geo-tagged Twitter posts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the smoothing approach and validate the intuition that geo-locations have the tendency to share similar "ideas" in the formation of conceptual communities.},

abstract = {The localness inference problem is to identify whether a person is a local resident in a city or not and the likelihood of a venue to attract local people. This information is critical for many applications such as targeted ads of local business, urban planning, localized news and travel recommendations. While there are prior work on geo-locating people in a city using supervised learning approaches, the accuracy of those techniques largely depends on a high quality training dataset, which is difficult and expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we propose to exploit spatial-temporal-social constraints from noisy online social media data to solve the localness inference problem using an unsupervised approach. The spatial-temporal constraint represents the correlations between people and venues they visit and the social constraint represents social connections between people. In particular, we develop a Spatial-Temporal-Social-Aware (STSA) inference framework to jointly infer i) the localness of a person and ii) the local attractiveness of a venue without requiring any training data. We evaluate the performance of STSA scheme using three real-world datasets collected from Foursquare. Experimental results show that STSA scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques by significantly improving the estimation accuracy.},

abstract = {Various dedicated web services in the cyberspace, e.g., social networks, e-commerce, and instant communications, play a significant role in people's daily-life. Billions of people around the world access them through multiple online identifiers (IDs), and interact with each other in both the cyberspace and the physical world. These two kinds of interactions are highly relevant to each other. In order to link between the cyberspace and the physical world, we propose a new type of social network, i.e., co-location social network (CLSN). A CLSN contains online IDs describing people's online presence and offline interactions when people come across each other. By analyzing real data collected from a mainstream ISP in China, which contains 32.7 million IDs across most popular web services, we build a large-scale CLSN, and evaluate its unique properties. The results verify that the CLSN is quite different from existing online and offline social networks in terms of different classic graph metrics. This paper is the first research to study CLSN at scale and paves the way for future studies of this new type of social network.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {We study a natural problem: Given a small piece of a large parent network, is it possible to identify the parent network? We approach this problem from two perspectives. First, using several "sophisticated" or "classical" network features that have been developed over decades of social network study. These features measure aggregate properties of the network and have been found to take on distinctive values for different types of network, at the large scale. By using these classical features within a standard machine learning framework, we show that one can identify large parent networks from small (even 8-node) subgraphs. Second, we present a novel adjacency matrix embedding technique which converts the small piece of the network into an image and, within a deep learning framework, we are able to obtain prediction accuracies upward of 80%, which is comparable to or slightly better than the performance from classical features.Our approach provides a new tool for topology-based prediction which may be of interest in other network settings. Our approach is plug and play, and can be used by non-domain experts. It is an appealing alternative to the often arduous task of creating domain specific features using domain expertise.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {In community question and answering sites, pairs of questions and their high-quality answers (like best answers selected by askers) can be valuable knowledge available to others. However lots of questions receive multiple answers but askers do not label either one as the accepted or best one even when some replies answer their questions. To solve this problem, high-quality answer prediction or best answer prediction has been one of important topics in social media. These user-generated answers of ten consist of multiple "views", each capturing different (albeit related) information (e.g., expertise of the asker, length of the answer, etc.). Such views interact with each other in complex manners that should carry a lot of information for distinguishing a potential best answer from others. Little existing work has exploited such interactions for better prediction. To explicitly model these information, we propose a new learning-to-rank method, ranking support vector machine (RankSVM) with weakly hierarchical lasso in this paper. The evaluation of the approach was done using data from Stack Overflow. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior performance compared with approaches in state-of-the-art.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Currently available artificial network generation models are characterized by consistency and low variance due to the rigidity of models' underlying assumptions. Networks generated from these models are usually too regular and do not contain noise and imbalance inherent in networks induced by human behavior. An important consequence is that much research on social network analysis presented in recent years used idealistic artificial networks that did not conform to reality. In order to alleviate this problem we introduce a new network generation model capable of modeling a broad spectrum of networks. In our model, the network formation process is not hard-coded into the model. Rather, we propose a simple mechanism for network creation based on priority ranking, and we encode the guiding principle of network formation as a distance function. By only changing the distance function definition and using the same priority ranking mechanism we are able to model very diverse networks. Our preliminary results show that we can mimic the behavior of popular artificial network generation models, such as the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random network model, the Watts-Strogatz small world model, or the Albert-Barab\'{a}si preferential attachment model, but we can generate new types of networks as well. Following the principles of Open Science we publish the source code used to perform experiments and publish results in a public repository1},

abstract = {Blockmodelling is a technique whose aim is to identify meaningful structure in networks. Community finding is a type of blockmodelling in so far as it focuses on identifying dense subgraph structure. Generalised blockmodelling allows an analyst to explicitly control the type of extracted structure. When compared to the well studied community-finding problem, generalised blockmodelling algorithms lag well behind in terms of their scalability. In this paper we formulate and evaluate a generalised blockmodelling algorithm, based on the Infomap information-theoretic community-finding algorithm. We reformulate the optimisation objective of the Infomap algorithm, so that it is extended to identify specific types of meso-scale structure that are given as input by the analyst. We evaluate our method against other generalised blockmodelling algorithms.},

abstract = {A central problem in analyzing networks is partitioning them into modules or communities. One of the best tools for this is the stochastic block model, which clusters vertices into blocks with statistically homogeneous pattern of links. Despite its flexibility and popularity, there has been a lack of principled statistical model selection criteria for the stochastic block model. Here we propose a Bayesian framework for choosing the number of blocks as well as comparing it to the more elaborate degree-corrected block models, ultimately leading to a universal model selection framework capable of comparing multiple modeling combinations. We will also investigate its theoretic connection to the minimum description length principle.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Dynamic community detection has been of great significance on analyzing network structure and community evolution. Among state-of-the-art methods, incremental algorithms based on modularity have been used widely, for the fully utilization of both current and historical information. Unfortunately, they are difficult to uncover small community due to problem called "resolution limit" and also sensitive to the sequence of network increments' arrival. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic community detection algorithm based on distance dynamics, which detects community in near-linear time. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods by replacing modularity with local interaction model. In a sense, it is assumed that increments can be treated as disturbance of network. It can be limited to a certain "local area" by disturbing factor. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has achieved well balance between efficiency and effectiveness both in synthetic and real world networks.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Dynamics of interactions play an increasingly important role in the analysis of complex networks. A modeling framework to capture this are temporal graphs. We focus on enumerating Δ-cliques, an extension of the concept of cliques to temporal graphs: for a given time period Δ, a Δ-clique in a temporal graph is a set of vertices and a time interval such that all vertices interact with each other at least after every Δ time steps within the time interval. Viard, Latapy, and Magnien [ASONAM 2015] proposed a greedy algorithm for enumerating all maximal Δ-cliques in temporal graphs. In contrast to this approach, we adapt to the temporal setting the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm---an efficient, recursive backtracking algorithm which enumerates all maximal cliques in static graphs. We obtain encouraging results both in theory (concerning worst-case time analysis based on the parameter "Δ-slice degeneracy" of the underlying graph) as well as in practice with experiments on real-world data. The latter culminates in a significant improvement for most interesting Δ-values concerning running time in comparison with the algorithm of Viard, Latapy, and Magnien (typically two orders of magnitude).},

abstract = {Due to the growing presence of large-scale and streaming graphs such as social networks, graph sampling and clustering play an important role in many real-world applications. One key aspect of graph clustering is the evaluation of cluster quality. However, little attention has been paid to evaluation measures for clustering quality on samples of graphs. As first steps towards appropriate evaluation of clustering methods on sampled graphs, in this work we present two novel evaluation measures for graph clustering called Δ-precision and Δ-recall. These measures effectively reflect the match quality of the clusters in the sampled graph with respect to the ground-truth clusters in the original graph. We show in extensive experiments on various benchmarks that our proposed metrics are practical and effective for graph clustering evaluation.},

abstract = {In this work we present a new local, vertex-level measure of community change. Our measure detects vertices that change community membership due to the actions (edges) of a vertex itself and not only due to global community shifts. The local nature of our measure is important for analyzing real graphs because communities may change to a large degree from one snapshot in time to the next. Using both real and synthetic graphs, we compare our measure to an alternative, global approach. Both approaches detect community switching vertices in a synthetic example with little overall community change. However, when communities do not evolve smoothly over time, the global approach flags a very large number of vertices, while our local method does not.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The study of Web user profiling can be traced back to 30 years ago, with the goal of extracting "semantic"-based user profile attributes from the unstructured Web. Despite slight differences, the general method is to first identify relevant pages of a specific user and then use machine learning models (e.g., CRFs) to extract the profile attributes from the page. However, with the rapid growth of the Web volume, such a method suffers from data redundancy and error propagation between the two steps. In this paper, we revisit the problem of Web user profiling in the big data era, trying to deal with the new challenges. We propose a simple but very effective approach for extracting user profile attributes from the Web using big data. To avoid error propagation, the approach processes all the extraction subtasks in one unified model. To further incorporate human knowledge to improve the extraction performance, we propose a markov logic factor graph (MagicFG) model. The MagicFG model describes human knowledge as first-order logics and combines the logics into the extraction model. Our experiments on a real data set show that the proposed method significantly improves (+4--6%; p ≪ 0.01, t-test) the extraction performance in comparison with several baseline methods.},

abstract = {1Success of Meetup groups is of utmost importance for the members who organize them. Given a wide variety of such groups, a single metric may not be indicative of success for different groups; rather, success measure should be specific to the interest of a group. In this paper, accounting for the group diversity, we systematically define Meetup group success metrics and use them to generate labels for our machine learnt models. We crawl the Meetup dataset for three US cities namely New York, Chicago and San Francisco over a period of 8 months. The data study reveals the key players (such as core members, new members etc.) behind the success of the Meetup groups. This study leverages semantic, syntactic, temporal and location based features to discriminate between successful and unsuccessful groups. Finally, we present a model to predict success of the Meetup groups with high accuracy (0.81 with AUC = 0.86). Our approach generalizes well across groups, categories and cities. Additionally, the model performs reasonably well for new groups with little history (cold start problem), exhibiting high accuracy for the cross city validation.},

The challenge of mental disorders is that they are difficult to detect on suffering patients, thus presenting an alarming number of undetected cases and misdiagnosis. In this paper, we aim at building predictive models that leverage language and behavioral patterns, used particularly in social media, to determine whether a user is suffering from two cases of mental disorder. These predictive models are made possible by employing a novel data collection process, coined as Subconscious Crowdsourcing, which helps to collect a faster and more reliable dataset of patients. Our experiments suggest that extracting specific language patterns and social interaction features from reliable patient datasets can greatly contribute to further analysis and detection of mental disorders.},

abstract = {Social networks are known to form on the basis of homophily, where nodes with some type of similar characteristics are more likely to be connected. Some of the most fundamental human characteristics are reflected by an individual's personality, which represents a persistent disposition governing a human's outlook and approach to diverse situations. While taking into account demographics of age and gender, we assess the extent to which personality homophily is evident in the local network features of Facebook. Using a large sample obtained from the MyPersonality dataset, we find that a range of network-based features correlate with personality facets of individuals. In particular, extraversion had a positive effect on an individual's network size, while neuroticism had a negative effect. Additionally, extraversion and openness were positively related to transitivity, which was moderated by gender. Finally, we found that conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion were homophilous: people with higher similarity on these facets were more strongly connected. This was additionally mediated by gender for agreeableness: personality similarity had an effect for male-only and mixed pairs, but not for female-only pairs. Personality similarity was also stronger among closed triangles, compared to open ones. These results support the idea that inherent attraction between individuals, on the basis of personality, drives the roles we play within our online social networks.},

We propose a method to identify bad recommendations by modeling the users' latent preferences that are yet to be captured using a residual model, which can be applied independently on top of existing recommendation algorithms. We include two components in the residual utility: benefit and cost, which can be learned simultaneously from users' observed interactions with the recommender system. We further classify user behavior into fine-grained categories, based on which an efficient optimization algorithm to estimate the benefit and cost using Bayesian partial order is proposed. By accurately calculating the utility users obtained from recommendations based on the benefit-cost analysis, we can infer the optimal threshold to determine the downside portion of the recommender system. We validate the proposed method by experimenting with real-world datasets and demonstrate that it can help to prevent bad recommendations from showing.},

Empirical results on data collected from Google+, LinkedIn, and Foursquare show that users' vulnerability in terms of identifiability and data exposure level can be significantly reduced while public profile utility can be maintained using our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Recently, there have been considerable efforts to use online data to investigate international migration. These efforts show that Web data are valuable for estimating migration rates and are relatively easy to obtain. However, existing studies have only investigated flows of people along migration corridors, i.e. between pairs of countries. In our work, we use data about "places lived" from millions of Google+ users in order to study migration 'clusters', i.e. groups of countries in which individuals have lived sequentially. For the first time, we consider information about more than two countries people have lived in. We argue that these data are very valuable because this type of information is not available in traditional demographic sources which record country-to-country migration flows independent of each other. We show that migration clusters of country triads cannot be identified using information about bilateral flows alone. To demonstrate the additional insights that can be gained by using data about migration clusters, we first develop a model that tries to predict the prevalence of a given triad using only data about its constituent pairs. We then inspect the groups of three countries which are more or less prominent, compared to what we would expect based on bilateral flows alone. Next, we identify a set of features such as a shared language or colonial ties that explain which triple of country pairs are more or less likely to be clustered when looking at country triples. Then we select and contrast a few cases of clusters that provide some qualitative information about what our data set shows. The type of data that we use is potentially available for a number of social media services. We hope that this first study about migration clusters will stimulate the use of Web data for the development of new theories of international migration that could not be tested appropriately before.},

title = {How Fashionable is Each Street? Quantifying Road Characteristics Using Social Media},
year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Determining routes that provide opportunities to satisfy the various demands of users is still an open problem. This is because it is virtually impossible to manually quantify the characteristics of each road and there are few resources describing roads directly such that we meet any demand that may arise. The goal of this study is to automatically quantify the characteristics of roads for demands that can be described using keywords such as "fashionable". To achieve this goal, we propose a two-stage method that analyzes social media and road networks. First, our method estimates the topic distribution (i.e., the characteristics) of each point-of-interest (POI) by analyzing geo-tagged texts with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Next, it uses a Markov random field model to estimate the characteristics of each road on the basis of those of POIs and the road networks associated with the POIs. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves statistically significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of ranking quality in the information retrieval for roads in three areas given 25 keywords.},

abstract = {The problem of detecting events from content published on microblogs has garnered much interest in recent times. In this paper, we address the questions of what happens after the outbreak of an event in terms of how the event gradually progresses and attains each of its milestones, and how it eventually dissipates. We propose a model based approach to capture the gradual unfolding of an event over time. This enables the model to automatically produce entire timeline trajectories of events from the time of their outbreak to their disappearance. We apply our model on the Twitter messages collected about Ebola during the 2014 outbreak and obtain the progression timelines of several events that occurred during the outbreak. We also compare our model to several existing topic modeling and event detection baselines in literature to demonstrate its efficiency.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Individuals have distinctive ways of speaking and writing, and there exists a long history of linguistic and stylistic investigation into authorship attribution. Most authorship identification approaches are exclusively based on lexical measures such as vocabulary richness and lexico-syntactic features, or substantially generate relevant features for different machine learning approaches. These techniques are inefficient without suitable feature selection or large corpus. In this paper, we introduce three graph based models for the task of authorship identification, that consider the interaction of character sequences, phraseological patterns and structure of the sentences in the document to construct graphs separately for an author. For each model, all such graphs for different authors are aggregated to generate a combined weighted training graph. Then a simple graph traversal algorithm is used to compare testing graph with the training graph. The experiment is conducted on the documents of six authors collected from Bengali literature. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform four state-of-the-art models (9.89% higher than the best baseline model) even for short training dataset.},

abstract = {Drug use and abuse is a serious societal problem. The fast development and adoption of social media and smart mobile devices in recent years bring about new opportunities for advancing computer-based strategies for understanding and intervention of drug-related behaviors. However, the existing literature still lacks principled ways of building computational models for supporting effective analysis of large-scale, often unstructured social media data. Part of the challenge stems from the difficulty of obtaining so-called ground-truth data that are typically required for training computational models. This paper presents a progressive semi-supervised learning approach to identifying Twitter tweets that are related to personal and recreational use of marijuana. Based on a small, labeled dataset, the proposed approach first learns optimal mapping of raw features from the tweets for classification, using a method of weakly hierarchical lasso. The learned feature model is then used to support unsupervised clustering of Web-scale data. Experiments with realistic data crawled from Twitter are used to validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

People like to accumulate badge for various reasons, which are modeled as the "badge values" in this paper. Meanwhile, to get badges, people also need to exert efforts to finish the required tasks, which will lead to certain "costs" as well. To understand users' badge achievement activities better, we will study an existing badge system launched in a real-world online social network, Foursquare, in this paper.

Tinder presents its users with pictures of people geographically nearby, whom they can either like or dislike based on first impressions.

We reveal differences between the way men and women interact with the app, highlighting the strategies employed. Women attain large numbers of matches rapidly, whilst men only slowly accumulate matches. Most notably, our results indicate that a little effort in grooming profiles, especially for male users, goes a long way in attracting attention.},

abstract = {Friendster is a social networking service which used to be popular all over the world at the beginning of the 21st century and declined thereafter. Some researchers have examined the process of decline and explained that the social network on Friendster collapsed from the outside of the core structure.In order to verify if their assertion is true, we analyze the time evolution of the network structure more carefully. The result implies that the collapse of the Friendster networks actually started from the center of the core structure.We also attempt to explain its mechanism by a model based on the SIR model, which is a model in epidemiology. The findings imply that the tendency of "non-users who have many friends on Friendster are likely to register for Friendster" and "users who have many friends that are already tired of Friendster are likely to leave Friendster" played an important role in the time evolution of the core structure of the network. The tendency of "users who have few friends on Friendster are likely to leave soon" would have also played a key role in the process.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Advertisers in online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook and LinkedIn have some preferred set of users they wish to reach by showing their ads. OSNs offer fine-grained sets of user characteristics - including their career, wealth, education information, etc --- that advertisers can specify for targeting their audience, and each of these characteristics requires different amounts of money for targeting.The problem we address is what we call the targeting problem, that is, given a set ST characteristics of interest to an advertiser (that is, the advertiser wishes to reach users who have these characteristics, i.e. U(ST)) and a budget b0 he wishes to spend, how to split the budget among the user characteristics so that they can reach the most number of users in U(ST)?• OSN-perspective. OSNs have complete knowledge of each user and their characteristics. In this case, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for the targeting problem and prove that it is an 1 - 1/e approximation to the targeting that gets the optimal number of users. We define the marginal increment and iteratively maximize it.• Advertiser-perspective. No single advertiser has the mapping of users to their characteristics or the distribution of users over the characteristics, and hence they cannot use the algorithm from above. We show through empirical data analysis that the strategy of targeting subsets U(S) ⊆ U(ST) is their only feasible approach (in other words, targeting U(S) ⊈ U(ST) will be arbitrarily worse than the direct solution). For evaluation, we crawl and analyze more than one million suggested bids from Facebook and LinkedIn. Further, we propose a fast greedy algorithm for the targeting problem based on targeting subsets, that in empirical analysis, increases the number of reached preferred users by nearly 40% over directly targeting the characteristics of interest, and for a moderate budget, it increases the number of reached preferred users by nearly 20%.},

abstract = {Recent increases in the adoption of Online Social Networks (OSNs) for advertising has resulted in the research and development of algorithms that can maximize the resulting revenue. OSN users are likely to be influenced by their friends; therefore, one can leverage friendship relationships to determine how advertisements should be distributed among users. If a user is given an indication that their friend clicked on an advertisement link (called an impression), then they are more likely to also click on the impression if it were to be provided to them. The problem of assigning impressions can be modeled as an optimization problem in which the goal is to maximize the expected number of clicks achieved given a fixed number of impressions. Hosein and Lawrence [1] formulated this as a Stochastic Dynamic Programming problem in which impressions are provided in stages and the outcomes of previous stages are used in making impression allocations for the present stage. However, the determination of the optimal solution is computationally intractable for large problems; hence we require heuristics that are efficient while providing near-optimal solutions. In this paper we provide and compare various heuristics for this problem.},

To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We compare causal and control statements using statistical language and sentiment analysis tools. We find that causal statements have a number of significant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on news and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal relationships, as shown by topic models. By quantifying the features and potential biases of causality communication, this study improves our understanding of the accuracy of information and opinions found online.},

Twitter, one example of social media, has especially felt the impact, with bots accounting for a large portion of its users. These bots have been used for malicious tasks such as spreading false information about political candidates and inflating the perceived popularity of celebrities. Furthermore, these bots can change the results of common analyses performed on social media. It is important that researchers and practitioners have tools in their arsenal to remove them. Approaches exist to remove bots, however they focus on precision to evaluate their model at the cost of recall. This means that while these approaches are almost always correct in the bots they delete, they ultimately delete very few, thus many bots remain. We propose a model which increases the recall in detecting bots, allowing a researcher to delete more bots. We evaluate our model on two real-world social media datasets and show that our detection algorithm removes more bots from a dataset than current approaches.},

abstract = {While online social networks provide access to a massive information source, they also enable wide dissemination of false or inaccurate content. Undesirable results caused by misinformation propagation make its timely detection very imperative. An important question is how many monitors are required to detect all misinformation cascades at their early stage.To answer this question, we define a Time Constrained Misinformation Detection (TCMD) problem. As we have proved, there is no polynomial time (1 - ε) ln n-approximation for the TCMD problem. The large number of independent misinformation cascades and heterogeneous delays make misinformation detection more challenging. Our approach includes stochastic programming and an O(ln(1 + n)) approximation algorithm for one-hop detection. This approach can provide a lower bound on the number of required monitors for general detection. Furthermore, we propose a network-compression based solution, whose effectiveness is validated by extensive experimental results.},

title = {Trustingness &amp; Trustworthiness: A Pair of Complementary Trust Measures in a Social Network},
year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The increase in analysis of real life social networks has led to a better understanding of the ways humans socialize in a group. Since trust is an important part of any social interaction, researchers use such networks to understand the nuances of trust relationships. One of the major requirements in trust applications is identifying the trustworthy actors in these networks. This paper proposes a pair of complementary measures that can be used to measure trust scores of actors in a social network using involvement of social networks. Based on the proposed measures, an iterative matrix convergence algorithm is developed that calculates the trustingness and the trustworthiness of each actor in the network. Trustingness of an actor is defined as the propensity of an actor to trust his neighbors in the network. Trustworthiness, on the other hand, is defined as the willingness of the network to trust an individual actor. The algorithm is proposed based on the idea that a person having higher trustingness score contributes to the trustworthiness of its neighbors to a lower degree. Conversely, a higher trustworthiness score is a result of lots of neighbors linked to the actor having low trustingness scores. The algorithm runs in O(k X |E|) time where k denotes the number of iterations and |E| denotes the number of edges in the network. Moreover, the paper shows that the algorithm converges to a finite value quickly. Finally the proposed scores for trust prediction is implemented for various social networks and is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better (average 5%) than the state of the art trust scoring algorithms.

abstract = {How can we automatically clean and curate online reviews to better mine them for knowledge discovery? Typical online reviews are full of noise and abnormalities, hindering semantic analysis and leading to a poor customer experience. Abnormalities include non-standard characters, unstructured punctuation, different/multiple languages, and misspelled words. Worse still, people will leave "junk" text, which is either completely nonsensical, spam, or fraudulent. In this paper, we describe three types of noisy and abnormal reviews, discuss methods to detect and filter them, and, finally, show the effectiveness of our cleaning process by improving the overall distributional characteristics of review datasets.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Many recent studies on finance and social networks discovered that investor's attention is correlated to the financial market movement in terms of the price shocks. Following related findings, a significant and challenging problem is to forecast the direction of the market movement based on vast social media activities. Appropriately processing social networks data and developing models to capture investor's attention on stocks would effectively help financial forecasting. In this paper, we propose and then apply a price shocks forecasting framework, which simultaneously takes the influence of social network users and their opinions about stocks into consideration. Specifically, we develop a new method to estimate social attention to stocks by influence modeling and sentiment analysis. Then, we use it in price shocks forecasting, which we formalize as a classification problem. We also consider the effect of historical market information on the market movement. Finally, we evaluate our framework based on a series of tests on the Chinese stock data. Our results show that the newly proposed measurement of social attention effectively improves the forecasting power of our framework.},

abstract = {Third party tracking of user behavior via web cookies represents a privacy threat. In this paper we assess this threat through an analysis of anonymized, crowd-sourced cookie data provided by Cookiepedia.co.uk. We find that nearly 45% of the cookies in the corpus are from Facebook and of the remaining cookies 25% come from 10 distinct domains. Over 65% are Maximal Permission cookies (i.e., 3rd party, non-secure, persistent, root-level). Cookiepedia's anonymization of user data presents challenges with respect to modeling site traffic. We further elucidate the privacy issue by conducting targeted crawling campaigns to supplement the Cookiepedia data. We find that the amount of traffic obscured by Cookiepedia's anonymizing procedure varies dramatically from site to site - sometimes obscuring as much as 80% of traffic. We use the crawls to infer the inverse function of the anonymizing procedure, allowing us to enhance the crowd-sourced dataset while maintaining user anonymity.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {In this paper we tackle the recently proposed problem of hidden streams. In many situations, the data stream that we are interested in, is not directly accessible. Instead, part of the data can be accessed only through applying filters (e.g. keyword filtering). In fact this is the case of the most discussed social stream today, Twitter. The problem in this case is how to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible by applying the most appropriate set of filters to the original stream and, at the same time, respect a number of constrains (e.g. maximum number of filters that can be applied). In this work we introduce a search approach on a dynamic filter space. We utilize heterogeneous filters (not only keywords) making no assumptions about the attributes of the individual filters. We advance current research by considering realistically hard constraints based on real-world scenarios that require tracking of multiple dynamic topics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on a set of topics of static and dynamic nature.The development of the approach was motivated by a real application. Our system is deployed in Dublin City's Traffic Management Center and allows the city officers to analyze large sources of heterogeneous data and identify events related to traffic as well as emergencies.},

abstract = {A major part of the job offers and candidates profiles are now available online. Leveraging this public data, Multiposting, a subsidiary of SAP, aims at providing in real-time an exhaustive job market analysis through the SmartSearch project. One big issue in this project, and more generally in the e-recruitment and the human resources management, is to extract the skills from the raw texts in order to associate a job or a candidate to its corresponding skills. This paper proposes to generate a multilingual base of skills in a novel bottom-up approach that finds its roots from the terminology used by candidates in professional social networks. The knowledge base is built by leveraging the Linked Open Data project DBpedia, as well as the tags of a Q&amp;A website, StackOverflow. The large-scale experiments on real-world job offers show that the coverage and precision of the skills extraction are higher using this base than existing bases. The system has been implemented in industrial context and is used daily to extract the skills from thousands of documents, leading to advanced statistics as illustrated at the end this paper.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Information cascades exist in a wide variety of platforms on Internet. A very important real-world problem is to identify which information cascades can "go viral". A system addressing this problem can be used in a variety of applications including public health, marketing and counter-terrorism. As a cascade can be considered as compound of the social network and the time series. However, in related literature where methods for solving the cascade prediction problem were proposed, the experimental settings were often limited to only a single metric for a specific problem formulation. Moreover, little attention was paid to the run time of those methods. In this paper, we first formulate the cascade prediction problem as both classification and regression. Then we compare three categories of cascade prediction methods: centrality based, feature based and point process based. We carry out the comparison through evaluation of the methods by both accuracy metrics and run time. The results show that feature based methods can outperform others in terms of prediction accuracy but suffer from heavy overhead especially for large datasets. While point process based methods can also run into issue of long run time when the model can not well adapt to the data. This paper seeks to address issues in order to allow developers of systems for social network analysis to select the most appropriate method for predicting viral information cascades.},

This gives us the app2vec vectorization of apps. We apply this to industrial scale data from Yahoo! and (a) show examples that app2vec captures semantic relationships between apps, much as word2vec does with words, (b) show using Yahoo!'s extensive human evaluation system that 82% of the retrieved top similar apps are semantically relevant, achieving 37% lift over bag-of-word approach and 140% lift over matrix factorization approach to vectorizing apps, and (c) finally, we use app2vec to predict app-install conversion and improve ad conversion prediction accuracy by almost 5%. This is the first industry scale design, training and use of app vectorization.},

Regression analyses show that, while follower brands respond to brand similarity and competitive pressure by relying on informational posts, the informational content of leaders presents a U-shaped relation with brand similarity. We interpret this finding using two theories from the marketing literature: the tradeoff between new and existing customers, and marketing life cycle of industries.},

abstract = {Nowadays, detecting health-violating restaurants is a serious problem due to the limited number of health inspectors in a city as compared to the number of restaurants. Rarely inspectors are helped by formal complains, but many complaints are reported as reviews on social media such as Yelp.In this paper we propose new predictors to detect health-violating restaurants based on restaurant sub-area location, previous inspections history, Yelp reviews content, and Yelp users behavior. The resulting method outperforms past work, with a percentage of improvement in Cohen's kappa and Matthews correlation coefficient of at least 16%. In addition, we define a new method that directly evaluates the benefit of a classifier on the ability of an inspector in detecting health-violating restaurants. We show that our classification method really improves the ability of the inspector and outperforms previous solutions.},

abstract = {One highly studied topic in the field of social networks is the search for influential nodes, that when seeded (i.e. infected intentionally), may infect a large portion of the network through a viral process. However, when it comes to the spread of new products, such viral processes are rather rare. Social influence is indeed an important factor when it comes to the act of adopting a new product. However, this influence is usually latent and does not trigger the purchase action by itself, it therefore requires an additional sales effort. We propose a model and a method that better fit the product adoption scenario. Our method allocates the seeding efforts not only to precise nodes but also at precise points in time, such that the product adoption rate increases. By conducting a set of empirical simulations, we show that under realistic assumptions, our method improves the product adoption rate by 25%--50%.},

abstract = {In social networks, individuals and systems work side by side. While individuals make decisions to filter or forward information, systems also prioritize and sort information to manage and assist individual information processing. It has long been argued that system level manipulations can reduce access of individuals to novel information. In this paper, we study how sorting of messages in one's inbox can help or hinder access of diverse information in the network through simulation of cognitively bounded actors. We show that first-in-first-out (FIFO) method of message sorting is ideal in bursty information arrival rates and in networks with lower diameter. Last-in-first-out (LIFO) method of message sorting is ideal for streaming information arrival, but leads to information overload in bursty scenarios by creating too many redundant copies of some of the information in the network. In short, the ideal message sorting method that enhances access to diverse information depends on the network type and information access patterns.},

We correlate these scores with productivity (number of total publications for each author), and h-index (the number of papers h for which an author has h citations). We also provide data on how network characteristics vary by role for each gender studied. Our results indicate that being well connected is more highly correlated with success for women than men for most of the institutions we studied.

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Do case citations reflect the "real" importance of individual judgments for the legal system concerned? This question has long been puzzling empirical legal scholars. Existing research typically studies case citation networks as a whole applying traditional network metrics stemming from graph theory. Those approaches are able to detect globally important cases, but since they do not take time explicitly into account, they cannot provide a comprehensive account of the dynamics behind the network structure and its evolution.In this paper we provide such a description, using two node importance metrics that take time into account to study important cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union over time. We then compare cases deemed as important by the metrics, with a set of 50 cases selected by the Court as the most important (landmark) cases.Our contribution is twofold. First, with regard to network science, we show that structural and time-related properties are complementary, and necessary to obtain a complete and nuanced picture of the citation network. Second, with regard to the case law of the Court, this study provides empirical evidence clarifying the motivation of the Court when selecting the landmark cases, revealing the importance of symbolic and historical cases in the selection. In addition, the temporal analysis sheds new light on the network properties specific to the landmark cases that distinguishes them from the rest of the cases. We validate our results by providing legal interpretations that sustain the highlights provided by the proposed network analysis.},

abstract = {Glaucoma is a silent eye disease that steals sight without warning and it is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. It cannot be cured but it can be controlled. A gene network analysis to understand the cross talk between glaucoma networks of genes could contribute to better understanding and treatment of the disease. In this paper, we extend our previous text mining and network analysis research for extraction of a more comprehensive glaucoma interaction network from PubMed Central articles. After text mining of the PubMed Central literature to extract potential sentences bearing associations between glaucoma genes in the literature, the mined associations are used to construct a glaucoma gene interaction network and a network analysis is applied to understand the building structure of the network. The network analysis reveals a succinct network composed of five distinct clusters associated with seven benchmark glaucoma biomarkers. The knowledge that can be extracted from such a network could provide a useful summative knowledge base to complement other forms of clinical information related to this disease that affects many diagnosed individuals worldwide.},

Within Twitter, for example, it appears that the huge stream of data is, most of the time, incompatible with a flexible analysis unless to have high computer resources. The only practical solution is often to observe in a static way a limited portion of a phenomenon in a limited time slot. This paper is devoted to the study of necessary conditions to provide an equilibrium between the computer architecture complexity and the analysis flexibility.},

title = {Finding Street Gang Members on Twitter},
year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Most street gang members use Twitter to intimidate others, to present outrageous images and statements to the world, and to share recent illegal activities. Their tweets may thus be useful to law enforcement agencies to discover clues about recent crimes or to anticipate ones that may occur. Finding these posts, however, requires a method to discover gang member Twitter profiles. This is a challenging task since gang members represent a very small population of the 320 million Twitter users. This paper studies the problem of automatically finding gang members on Twitter. It outlines a process to curate one of the largest sets of verifiable gang member profiles that have ever been studied. A review of these profiles establishes differences in the language, images, YouTube links, and emojis gang members use compared to the rest of the Twitter population. Features from this review are used to train a series of supervised classifiers. Our classifier achieves a promising F1 score with a low false positive rate.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {With the explosion of social networks, people more often share their opinions on-line, which provides a great opportunity to detect the public sentiment of a place in an automatic and timely way comparing to the conventional approaches, e.g., surveys, workshops and interviews. Even through the application of social sentiment analysis is widely discussed in many domains, e.g., politics, e-commerce, economy, and health and environment, to the best of our knowledge, no research has ever studied the effects of public sentiments of social networks in the domain of place design. In order to fill this vacancy, a sentiment analysis service, called geo-sentiment analysis service, is required, whose cores are 1) a social sentiment analysis engine, and 2) an intuitive and interactive visualization service. Thus, this paper firstly proposes CGSA: a <u>C</u>rowd-calibrated <u>G</u>eo-<u>S</u>entiment <u>A</u>nalysis mechanism, which can 1) start the sentiment analysis process based on the design of CTS (Compound Training Samples), and SSF (Social Sentiment Features), 2) perform three analyses, namely sentiment, clustering and time series analysis on geo-tagged social network messages, and 3) collect crowd-labelled data based on a crowdsourced calibration service to gradually improve the classification accuracy. As proved by two detailed analyses, SSF has the best accuracy in training sentiment classifiers, and the performance of the calibrated classifier increases gradually and significantly from 74.71% to 80.05% in three calibration cycles. Moreover, as a part of a big project "Liveable Places", "Sentiment in places" service with two visualization modes, namely 2D sentiment dashboard and 3D sentiment map, is implemented to support local authorities, urban designers and city planners better understand the effects of public sentiments regarding place (re)design in the testbed area: Jurong East, Singapore.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social Networks are evolving rapidly to have a significant number of users using or joining their platforms daily, and a huge volume of information exchange and flow continuously. As human is the center of all information traffic, the information propagation became subjected to the relations and influences between the sources of these information and their followers or fans, these influences might be difficult to understand and model directly. While observing Twitter network, we emphasize on the importance of the retweet as a primary method for information propagation inside Twitter network. We present a detailed analysis for the behavior of the retweet functionality in the twitter platform, and then we show how our findings could shape the diffusion of the information in a network according to the relations and influences between users. Moreover, we propose measures to form a fully weighted directed graph where links and nodes have calculated values, and links are only assigned at the existence of communication transactions; the new measures can be used to predict influences and information diffusions. Finally, we demonstrate how using a retweet network for specific users, we can allocate key players and hidden identities who are potentially having the same ideology or maybe belong to the same group of interest.},

abstract = {This paper amalgamates the field of positive psychology and social network analysis to explore what are the character strengths and virtues of individuals with high centrality measures within a close group of adolescent females. Research in the field of social network analysis in the last few decades has given a good understanding of different centrality measures. Today, we know what does an individual with high degree centrality, high betweenness centrality etc. signify in a group, this paper goes a step further, we attempt to find the correlation between individuals with high centrality measures and their character strengths. We analyze the friendship relationship of three different close groups of adolescent females studying in an undergraduate class. We construct the network of each class based on the friendship status and measure in-degree centrality, and betweenness centrality. The individuals with high centrality measures were then asked to undergo VIA character strength analysis. To investigate the correlation we quantified the character strength of the adolescent females with high centrality measures into numeric values using inverse transform and weighted sum technique. Our results show that an individual with highest in-degree centrality have kindness as one of her most prominent character strength, and individual with highest betweenness centrality have honesty, fairness and leadership as her prominent character strengths. Since an individual can be trained for particular character strengths, this correlation can help in training adolescent females (and may be extended to other groups) for specific role in an organization and society as a whole.},

abstract = {Microblogging sites like Twitter provide a platform for sharing ideas and expressing opinions. The widespread popularity of these platforms and the complex social structure that arises within these communities provides a unique opportunity to understand the interactions between users. The political domain, especially in a multi-party system, presents compelling challenges, as political parties have different levels of alignment based on their political strategies. We use Twitter to understand the nuanced relationships between differing political entities in Latin America. Our model incorporates diverse signals from the content of tweets and social context from retweets, mentions and hashtag usage. Since direct communications between entities are relatively rare, we explore models based on the posts of users who interact with multiple political organizations. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results of models using different features, and demonstrate that a model capable of using sentiment strength, social context, and issue alignment has superior performance to less sophisticated baselines.},

abstract = {This paper describes a methodology approach and a tool dedicated to the exploration of the twitter social stream by combining different contextual parameters such as time, keywords, gender or the opinion. The exploration can be made in two main modes depending on the fact that the phenomenon is either known or not. The first mode, similar to the use of Googlefight search engine, allows to compare the stream feedback for several groups of words. A typical example, that we will discuss, consists in evaluating trends in the domains of fashions or politic. The second mode consists in exploring the timeline of the social stream looking for unknown emerging events. This mode can be used to explore the past or to identify, in near real time, an event that will probably make the buzz.},

We build a large domain specific verb inference corpus containing 18,029 verb pairs with gold inference labels from math world problems. A five-folded experiment is performed. Results show that the proposed PSL model greatly outperforms our baseline.},

abstract = {The search for cohesive groups inside a social network is a topic commonly known as community detection and has attracted many researchers. However, the identification of groups with competitive features using blockmodeling, biclustering and structural or regular equivalences has benefited from a less important interest within the research community. In this paper we define a generic biclustering method called BiP that computes semantically meaningful coclusters (or biclusters) from a two-mode data network. The method has the following features: (i) it allows the processing of adjacency matrices whose data type can be either binary, discrete or categorical without any need for prior data codification, and (ii) each generated block may either represent a cluster of objects with the properties they own (or not), or a juxtaposition of sub-groups with distinct profiles (and sometimes purely opposed ones) for a subset of attributes.},

Then, we detect subgraphs (communities) using exceptional model mining techniques: We target subsets of sequential transitions between nodes that are exceptional in that sense that they either conform strongly to a specific reference or show significant deviations, estimated by a quality measure. In particular, such a community is described by a community pattern composed of descriptive features (of the attributed graph) covering the respective community.

abstract = {The maximum matching problem has been extensively studied, and several algorithms have been proposed which can maximize the percentage of matching. Nevertheless, these algorithms are designed without consideration of the topology of the networks on which they are intended to be applied. However, recent research has shown that many distributed systems from social, technical and biological domains which can be represented as networks display the scale-free structure, which has well-known topological characteristics such as the power-law degree distribution. In this paper, we describe a simple iterative heuristic for maximum matchings in scale-free networks which takes advantage of such characteristics. We show that our heuristic is no worse than the best known version of the Blossom algorithm in terms of time-complexity, and much better than any version of Blossom in terms of memory usage (space-complexity) when applied to typical scale-free networks. The heuristic due to its simplicity and memory efficiency is a viable alternative to Blossom in most real world applications.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The main question that this paper addresses is how to identify critical events in the evolution of a social network. The paper uses ideas from psychology about time perception. It is well known that time flows differently in different emotional situations. Equipped with this idea, this paper studies the relationship between two clocks. As opposed to standard synchronization, where everything is done in order to force clocks to agree on the time, the paper embraces the discrepancy between the clocks.This paper presents a standard model where two natural clocks exists simultaneously: the event clock Ce and the weighted clock Cw. As the paper shows, using the drift between those two clocks is useful to understand the dynamics in social networks. The main claim is that the drift between different clocks points to a critical event in the evolution of the social network, similar to time perception in psychology.In order to demonstrate this claim, plays by William Shakespeare were used, and from them two clocks were created: the "word time", which is the weighted clock, and the "response time", which is the event clock. The paper will introduce the concept of a single clock drift. A play can have many, or a single clock drift events. It is shown that in the single clock drift plays, the beginning of the drift points to a critical event in the play. The results are compared with the "standard common" opinion.},

abstract = {As the spread of rumours has been increasing every day in online social networks (OSNs), it is important to analyze and understand this phenomenon. Damage caused by the spread of rumours is difficult to handle without a full understanding of the dynamics behind it. One of the central steps of understanding rumour spread is to analyze who spread rumours online, why, and how. In this research, we focus on the steps who and why by describing, implementing, and evaluating an approach that studies whether or not a group of users is actively involved in rumour discussions, and assesses rumour-spreading personality types in OSNs. We implement this general approach using Reddit data, and demonstrate its use by determining which users engage with a recurring rumour, and analyzing their comments using qualitative methods. We find that we can reliably classify users into one of three categories: (1) "Generally support a false rumour", (2) "Generally refute a false rumour", or (3) "Generally joke about a false rumour". Combining text mining techniques, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis, we aim to identify and classify those rumour-spreading user categories automatically and provide a more holistic view of rumour spread in OSNs.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social networking sites (SNS), such as Facebook and Twitter, are important spaces for political engagement. SNS have become common elements in political participation, campaigns, and elections. However, little is known about the dynamics between candidate posts and commentator sentiment in response to those posts on SNS. This study enriches computational political science by studying the 2016 U.S. elections and how candidates and commentators engage on Facebook. This paper also examines how online activity might be connected to offline activity and vice versa. We extracted 9,700 Facebook posts by five presidential candidates (Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich) from their official Facebook pages and 12,050,595 comments on those posts. We employed topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and trends detection using wavelet transforms to discover topics, trends, and reactions. Our findings suggest that Republican candidates are more likely to share information on controversial events that have taken place during the election cycle, while Democratic candidates focus on social policy issues. As expected, commentators on Republican candidate pages express negative sentiments toward current public policies as they seldom support decisions made by the Obama administration, while commentators on democratic candidate pages are more likely to express support for continuation or advancement of existing policies. However, the significance (strong/weak) and nature (positive/negative) of sentiments varied between candidates within political parties based on perceived credibility of the candidate's degree of credibility on a given issue. Additionally, we explored correlation between online trends of comments/sentiment and offline events. When analyzing the trend patterns, we found that changes in online trends are driven by three factors: 1) popular post, 2) offline debates, and 3) candidates dropping out of the race.},

Given that, individuals within social movements bringing influence from other movements makes the study of spillover within social movements an important concentration for sociologists and others studying collective action (CA). This research explores the role of social movement spillover in investigating and sustaining the Women's Right to Drive movement in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We benefit from various models of established collective action theories developed in the pre-Internet era, and re-evaluate traditional theories of spillover within the modern ICT landscape by utilizing existing collective action theories/approaches and novel and innovative computational analytical tools. The findings of this study are conceptualized to shed new insights on information diffusion, mutual influence, role distribution analysis of activists/supporters across movements and provide a deeper understanding of interconnected social movements and social movement spillover. Applying computational metrics to measure the strength of spillover and its effects on complex social processes enable novel model development to help advance the understanding of interconnected collective actions conducted through modern social and information systems.},

abstract = {Law Enforcement Agencies cover a crucial role in the analysis of open data and need effective techniques to filter troublesome information. In a real scenario, Law Enforcement Agencies analyze Social Networks, i.e. Twitter, monitoring events and profiling accounts. Unfortunately, between the huge amount of internet users, there are people that use microblogs for harassing other people or spreading malicious contents. Users' classification and spammers' identification is a useful technique for relieve Twitter traffic from uninformative content. This work proposes a framework that exploits a non-uniform feature sampling inside a gray box Machine Learning System, using a variant of the Random Forests Algorithm to identify spammers inside Twitter traffic. Experiments are made on a popular Twitter dataset and on a new dataset of Twitter users. The new provided Twitter dataset is made up of users labeled as spammers or legitimate users, described by 54 features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of enriched feature sampling method.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {A content analysis of online sex worker advertisements suggests specific terms, sources and patterns of behavior that may help identify potential sex trafficked victims within these virtual environments. While some ads are posted by independent sex workers, others may have been posted by traffickers or pimps, advertising the women they have under their control. A total of 600 ads from the Backpage "escort" services site were harvested and analyzed for information elements including location, age, name, area code, ethnicity and controlled/restricted movement. The results suggest that 75% of the ads contained one or more of the primary sex trafficking indicators, and 15% of the ads contained three or more indicators. The results suggest that some physical indicators should be adapted to the virtual environment, and that the presence of multiple indicators can be used to prioritize certain ads for further investigation by law enforcement. It is hoped that these indicators can inform the design of future systems to flag high-risk advertisements, and help identify and disrupt this covert network activity.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the use of graph pattern matching for investigative graph search, which is the process of searching for and prioritizing persons of interest who may exhibit part or all of a pattern of suspicious behaviors or connections. While there are a variety of applications, our principal motivation is to aid law enforcement in the detection of homegrown violent extremists. We introduce investigative simulation, which consists of several necessary extensions to the existing dual simulation graph pattern matching scheme in order to make it appropriate for intelligence analysts and law enforcement officials. Specifically, we impose a categorical label structure on nodes consistent with the nature of indicators in investigations, as well as prune or complete search results to ensure sensibility and usefulness of partial matches to analysts. Lastly, we introduce a natural top-k ranking scheme that can help analysts prioritize investigative efforts. We demonstrate performance of investigative simulation on a real-world large dataset.},

abstract = {In addition to using social media to connect with others worldwide, many people nowadays get their news about different national or international events such as natural disasters, crises, political elections, conflicts etc. via social media. This evolution in the usage of social media has not only led to the generation of massive amounts of data but also various information consumption behaviors. In this study, we developed a framework that can be used to monitor/understand, analyze, and visualize in real time how people consume information and react to events. Following the case study of Apple, Inc. vs. FBI, we tracked the usage of the #NoBackDoor on Twitter in real time and were able to understand what people are thinking about the case and who are the actors involved in this network. The framework can be applied to study other events and provide a deeper understanding of how public sentiments evolve during an event, whether it is a crisis or major news event.},

abstract = {A major challenge in cyber-threat analysis is combining information from different sources to find the person or the group responsible for the cyber-attack. It is one of the most important technical and policy challenges in cyber-security. The lack of ground truth for an individual responsible for an attack has limited previous studies. In this paper, we take a first step towards overcoming this limitation by building a dataset from the capture-the-flag event held at DEFCON, and propose an argumentation model based on a formal reasoning framework called DeLP (Defeasible Logic Programming) designed to aid an analyst in attributing a cyber-attack. We build models from latent variables to reduce the search space of culprits (attackers), and show that this reduction significantly improves the performance of classification-based approaches from 37% to 62% in identifying the attacker.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to estimating healthcare fraud (HCF) risk that applies network algorithms to graphs derived from open source datasets. One group of algorithms calculates behavioral similarity to known fraudulent and non-fraudulent healthcare providers with respect to measurable healthcare activities, such as medical procedures and drug prescriptions. Another set of algorithms estimates propagation of risk from fraudulent healthcare providers through geospatial collocation, i.e., shared practice locations or other addresses. The algorithms were evaluated with respect to their ability to predict a provider's presence on the Office of the Inspector General's list of providers excluded from participation in Medicare and other Federal healthcare programs (exclusion). In an empirical evaluation, a combination of 11 features achieved an f-score of 0.919 and a ROC area of 0.960 in exclusion prediction. An ablation analysis showed that most of this predictive accuracy was the result of features that measure risk propagation through geospatial collocation.},

The vast amount of data generated by these social networks play a very important role in information diffusion. Social network data are generated by its users. So, user's behavior and activities are being investigated by the researchers to get a logical view of social network platform. This research proposed a novel retweet prediction model which considers difference in user's behavior as an author (as reflected in the tweets) and a retweeter (as reflected in the retweets) and do the prediction accordingly. The proposed retweet prediction strategy taking this difference into consideration, gave better prediction accuracy than the conventional strategy. The findings of this research explains that in social networks, some users show different behavior indifferent roles and these differences may have impact on future research.},

The forum data being used are from six Islamic forums on the Dark Web which are made available for security research. This research project uses a POS tagger to isolate keywords and nouns that can be utilized with the sentiment analysis program. Then the sentiment analysis program determines the polarity of the post. The post is scored as either positive or negative. These scores are then divided into monthly radical scores for each user. Once these time clusters are mapped, the change in opinions of the users over time may be interpreted as rising or falling levels of radicalism. Each user is then compared on a timeline to other radical users and events to determine possible connections or relationships. The ability to analyze a forum for an overall change in attitude can be an indicator of unrest and possible radical actions or terrorism.},

abstract = {Cyberbullying is an important socio-technical challenge in Online Social Networks (OSN). With the growth trends of heterogeneous data in OSN, better network characterization, and textual feature sophistication, recent efforts have realized the value of looking at heterogeneous modes of information including textual features, social features, and image-based features for better cyberbullying detection. These approaches, however, still use these features either individually or combine them 'naively' without considering the different confidence levels associated with each feature or the interdependencies between features. We propose a novel probabilistic information fusion framework that utilizes confidence score and interdependencies associated with different social and textual features and uses those to build better predictors for cyberbullying. The performance of the proposed approach was compared to a recent approach in literature which used a similar dataset and features and the proposed approach resulted in significant improvements in terms of cyberbullying detection.},

abstract = {In many parts of the world there are complex, violent interactions among groups with widely varying agendas. Situational awareness is difficult because there is rarely a clear distinction between good and bad actors, and there are constantly shifting alliances and oppositions between groups. This makes it difficult for analysts to understand the ecosystem of a country and region; still more to conceive of helpful interventions.We show how to use a newly developed spectral graph embedding technique that allows social networks with edge weights that are positive (alliance) and negative (opposition) to be modelled. We show the practical application by applying the technique to countries in North-West Africa, where civil wars are commonplace and complex islamist insurgencies have been active in the past few decades. A sense of the differences among these countries becomes visible, as well as a picture of the interactions among the key groups within each country.},

The results suggest that 67% of the sample contained indicators of movement. Social network analysis methods were applied to identify movement trends across the US. The use of SNA methods allowed prominent hubs and circuits of this activity to be observed, by providing a tool to uncover covert network structures and activity, yielding a method to capture movement trends of potential trafficked persons.

However, the useful tweets that users are really interested in personally could be covered by massive other uninformative and uninteresting information. Therefore, how to bring immediately the interesting tweets for users is always a challenging issue. In this paper, we consider the user friendships in detail and build an effective and practical model to calculate the friendships among users. Certainly, we also take user interests to tweets into account. We then propose a personalized approach for tweets ranking, which focus on the user friendships and the personal interests to tweets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method greatly outperforms several baselines and the user friendships have really important effect on tweets ranking.},

Answers and Stack Overflow provide a new way of asking and answering questions which are not well served by general web search engines.

Therefore, it is of great significance to design some effective strategies of recommending experts for new questions. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized recommendation method for routing new questions to a group of experts. Different from prior work which only considers the topic modeling or the link structure, we aim at recommending new questions to more appropriate experts by considering both of these two factors. Moreover, we design a new strategy of network construction with the personalization fully considered. The comparison experiments are conducted with Stack Overflow data and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance over other methods in expert recommendation.},

Also, recommendation systems can provide dynamic recommendations based on the users' preferences, such that they can give different recommendations for different hours of the day or different days of the week. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system which considers the users' temporal preference to give dynamic recommendation.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called STriCluster, to find tri-clusters from signed 3-partite graphs. The dataset contains three different types of nodes. Hyperedges connecting three nodes from three different partitions represent either positive or negative relations among those nodes. The aim of our algorithm is to find clusters with strong positive relations among its nodes. Moreover, negative relations up to a certain threshold is also allowed. Also, the clusters can have no overlapping hyperedges. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm via several experiments.},

abstract = {Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the last and the most life-threatening phase of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) disease. HIV attacks and heavily affects the immune system of the body which remains unable to resist the disease. HIV uses white blood cells to replicate itself and spreads everywhere in the body. The lifecycle of HIV disease, especially the replication stage must be prominently understood in order to develop effective drugs for treatment. HIV-1 protease enzyme is in charge of cleaving an amino acid octamer into peptides which are used to create proteins by virus. It should be scrutinized properly since it is a potential target to tightly bind drugs to protease for blocking the virus action at an early stage before cell infection. It is very critical to induce a model and predict cleavage of HIV-1 protease on octamers. Several machine learning approaches have been applied for predicting and profiling cleavage rules. However, we propose a novel general approach that can also be applied on different domains. It basically utilizes social network analysis and data mining techniques for classification. This method yet presents promising results that are comparable with existing machine learning methods, besides it gives the opportunity to validate the results obtained by using other techniques from social network analysis perspective. We have used the HIV-1 protease cleavage data set from UCI machine learning repository and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with decision tree, Naive-Bayes and k-nearest neighbor methods.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {One of the most interesting tasks in social network analysis is link prediction. There are a lot of studies dealing with link prediction task in the literature. In recent years, there is an increasing on link prediction methods trying to model network as more close to real networks such as heterogeneous, temporal and directed network models to gain better link prediction performance. Many of the existing link prediction methods don't take into account links directions in directed networks. In this paper we propose a new neighbor and graph pattern based topological metric considering direction of links for link prediction. The proposed metric also takes into account temporal and weighted information, which are useful to increase link prediction performance. Accuracy of the proposed metric is evaluated by comparison with multiple baseline metrics from literature in supervised learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric improves remarkably the accuracy of link prediction.},

abstract = {Semi-supervised learning makes the realistic assumptions that labelled data is typically rare, and that unlabelled data that are similar are likely to belong to the same class. Unlabelled data are assigned the labels associated with their "most similar" labelled neighbors. For graph-based semi-supervised learning, "most similar' is defined by weighted multipath path length in a graph. When classes are of different sizes, or the number of labelled nodes per class is not the same across classes, the performance of existing graph-based algorithms degrades sharply.We develop a new algorithm that creates representative nodes for each class, connects them to the labelled nodes of that class, adds negative edges between them, embeds the resulting graph using a signed graph Laplacian technique, and then predicts the unlabelled nodes using distance-based techniques in the geometry of the embedding. Its performance matches current algorithms for balanced datasets, but is much better for datasets where the classes, or the number of labelled records, differ in size.

abstract = {The day mankind met with smart-phones, a new era started. Since then, daily mobile internet usage rates are increasing everyday and people have developed new habits like frequently sharing information (photo, video, location, etc.) on online social networks. Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) are the platforms that empowers users to share place/location information with friends. As all other social networks, LBSNs aim to acquire more users with a smart friend recommendation. Solution for smart friend recommendation problem is studied under link prediction field by researchers. Check-in information is the main data for link prediction in LBSNs. Data extracted from check-in information plays vital role for predictor performance. In this study, we attempt to make use of detailed analysis of place category in order to exploit possible information gain enhancements through such semantic information. We proposed two new feature groups; Common Place Check-in Count Product Sum and Common Category Check-in Count Sum Product. For any link candidate pair; those features are calculated for each category. Use of new features improved the link prediction performance for multiple data subsets.},

We observe that sampling on semantic graphs (i.e., graphs with multiple edge types) presents fundamentally distinct challenges from sampling on traditional graphs. The purpose of our work is to present new challenges and initial solutions for sampling semantic graphs. Novel elements of our work include the following: (1) We provide a thorough discussion of problems encountered with naive breadth-first search on semantic graphs. We argue that common sampling methods such as breadth-first search face specific challenges on semantic graphs that are not encountered on graphs with homogeneous edge types. (2) We present two competing methods for creating semantic graphs from data collects, corresponding to the interactions between sampling of different edge types. (3) We discuss new metrics specific to graphs with multiple edge types, and discuss the effect of the sampling method on these metrics. (4) We discuss issues and potential solutions pertaining to sampling semantic graphs.},

isbn = {9781509028467},

abstract = {We focus on the vertex-centric (VC) model introduced in Pregel, a Google system for distributed graph processing. In particular, we consider two popular implementations of the VC model: Apache Giraph and GraphChi. The first is a VC system for cluster computing, while the second is a VC system for a single PC. Apache Giraph became very popular after careful engineering by Facebook researchers in 2012 to scale the computation of PageRank to a trillion-edge graph of user interactions using 200 machines. On the other hand, GraphChi became popular, around the same time in 2012, as it made possible to perform intensive graph computations in a single PC, in just under 59 minutes, whereas the distributed systems were taking 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1,000 computers (as reported also by MIT Technology Review). Since then, new versions of Apache Giraph and GraphChi have been released, where new ideas and optimizations have been implemented. Therefore, it is time to validate again the claims made four years ago. In this work, we embark in this validation. We consider three cornerstone graph problems: computing PageRank, shortest-paths, and weakly-connected-components. Based on current experiments, we conclude that in the present, even for a moderate number of simple machines, Apache Giraph outperforms GraphChi for all the algorithms and datasets tested. This is in contrast to the claims of the GraphChi authors in 2012.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to fast and inexpensive production of large amounts of biological sequence data, including nucleotide sequences and derived protein sequences. These fast-increasing volumes of data pose challenges to computational methods for annotation. Machine learning approaches, primarily supervised algorithms, have been widely used to assist with classification tasks in bioinformatics. However, supervised algorithms rely on large amounts of labeled data in order to produce quality predictors. Oftentimes, labeled data is difficult and expensive to acquire in sufficiently large quantities. When only limited amounts of labeled data but considerably larger amounts of unlabeled data are available for a specific annotation problem, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a cost-effective alternative. In this work, we focus on a special case of semi-supervised learning, namely transductive learning, in which the algorithm has access during the training phase to the instances that need to be labeled. Transduction is particularly suitable for biological sequence classification, where the goal is generally to label a given set of unlabeled instances. However, a challenge that needs to be addressed in this context consists of identification of compact sets of informative features. Given the lack of labeled data, standard supervised feature selection methods may result in unreliable features. Therefore, we study recently proposed unsupervised feature construction approaches together with transductive learning. Experimental results on two classification problems, namely cassette exon identification and protein localization, show that the unsupervised features result in better performance than the supervised features.},

We here finish off such work, comparing the satisfaction recorded by automatic means through the use of sentiment analysis techniques to the satisfaction recorded by expert physicians. In brief, two results appear to be of particular interest for the Crohn's disease community of patients: (a) physicians tend to classify as neutral many posts that were previously classified as negative, and, (b) posts of patients that have been treated with Infliximab for a long time are never classified as negative by medical examiners. In addition, this short paper sets forth, with strength, a problem of methodological nature: is it possible to effectively analyze the big data of patient online posts without a stronger cooperation between data analysts and medical experts?},

abstract = {Extensive clinical trials are required before a drug is placed on the market; yet it is difficult to discover all the side effects for any approved drugs. The United States Food and Drug Administration actively monitors approved medications to identify adverse events. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System contains a database of adverse drug events (ADE) reported by the healthcare providers and consumers. The pervasive online social networks, such as Twitter, can provide additional information ADE. Concurrently, advancements in social media technology have resulted in the booming of massive public data; the availability of these huge datasets offers numerous research opportunities for extracting ADEs. Towards this purpose, in this paper a simple, effective computation pipeline is proposed, which uses simple drug-related classification and sentiment analysis to extract ADEs on Twitter. The pipeline is described in detail, and is implemented into an automatic process. Experiments are carried out based on 4-months of Twitter data collected. Comparing with an existing pipeline, the new design is able to successfully capture 5 times more valid ADEs, among them 20% are new ADEs. The proposed method may be applied to other areas such as food, beverages, and other daily consumer products for identifying side effects and user opinions.},

abstract = {The advent of social networking and open health web forums such as PatientsLikeMe, WebMD, ehealth forum etc. have provided avenues for social user data that can prove instrumental in suggesting futuristic trends in healthcare. Homophily in social networks is a vital contributor for analyzing patterns for medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment options. Since, members with similar medical issues contribute to a common discussion pool; this offers a rich source of information that can be utilized. This paper intends to explore growing trends in Mental Health and Behavioral Studies (MHB) which lays emphasis on co-existing conditions resulting in comorbidity. We present a novel approach where personality traits inferred from unstructured text of patients and general social users are compared via statistical analysis. This is achieved by our Psychiatric Disorder Determination (PDD) algorithm. Further, Social media data of users showing personality traits of patients is subjected to semantic based text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Ontology Based Information Extraction (OBIE) in our Addiction Category Determination (ACD) algorithm. This provides categorization of user journals to common topics of discussion by referring to ontologies DBpedia, Freebase and YAGO2s. The final category hence obtained can be predicted to be a trending subject of concern for users with Psychiatric disorders developing Addictive behavioral personalities.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of social networks and their popularity especially Facebook and Twitter, healthcare related issues arise. Many users seek to follow and discuss similar disease experience. Thus, it sounds promising to develop a friendship prediction system for healthcare purposes. Moreover, due to the dynamic aspect of social networks link (friendship) prediction has attracted the attention of many researchers. Link prediction consists on inferring probable links that may occur in the next time-stamp. Shortcomings of this task reside on that links are predicted according to only one time period and advanced privacy settings are behind the invisibility of interactions. In this work, we present an overview of some existing link prediction methods. We mainly propose a new approach to predict possible friendship between individuals and also we integrate fuzzy logic to deal with the lack of precision and the vagueness in the similarity between two individuals. Finally, in order to validate our solution, we use real data. The experiments show encouraging results. Comparing with crisp approaches, fuzzy method seems more effective and shows more accurate predictions.},

abstract = {Dynamic graphs are used to represent changing relational data. In order to create a dynamic graph representing relationships or interactions over time, it is necessary to choose a method of adding new data and removing, or otherwise de-emphasizing, past data to decrease its influence. In particular, the question of aging edges is new to dynamic graphs and has not been thoroughly studied. In this work, we address the problem of aging vertices and edges to create a dynamic graph from a stream of temporal data. We provide two new methods, active vertex and active edge, and also evaluate two methods from the literature, sliding window and weight decay. By analyzing various properties of the dynamic graphs created by each aging method, we provide practitioners with quantitative comparisons. We find several interesting similarities and differences. The active vertex and weight decay methods reduce the variability over time of several vertex level measures compared to sliding window and active edge. This means that in practice, active vertex or weight decay may be more useful if graph stability is preferred, while sliding window or active edge may be preferred if the graph should be sensitive to changes in the underlying data stream. Each method also differently affects global measures. The most connected graph is produced by active vertex, while the most disconnected by weight decay. We observe that despite the differences, the graphs produced by each method experience similar types of changes at similar points in time.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Community and cluster detection is a popular field of social network analysis. Most algorithms focus on static graphs or series of snapshots.In this paper we present an hierarchical algorithm, which detects communities in dynamic graphs. The method is based on the shortest paths to high-connected nodes, so called hubs. Due to local message passing, we can update the clustering results with low computational effort. The used hierarchy allows to process the community detection without setting any parameters before. After processing it provides different cluster levels based on the selected threshold.The presented algorithm is compared with the Louvain method on large-scale real-world datasets with given community structure. The detected community structure is compared to the given with NMI scores. The advantage of the algorithm is the good performance in dynamic scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper explores the social quality (goodness) of community structures formed across Twitter users, where social links within the structures are estimated based upon semantic properties of user-generated content (corpus). We examined the overlap of the community structures of the constructed graphs, and followership-based social communities, to find the social goodness of the links constructed. Unigram, bigram and LDA content models were empirically investigated for evaluation of effectiveness, as approximators of underlying social graphs, such that they maintain the community social property. Impact of content at varying granularities, for the purpose of predicting links while retaining the social community structures, was investigated. 100 discussion topics, spanning over 10 Twitter events, were used for experiments. The unigram language model performed the best, indicating strong similarity of word usage within deeply connected social communities. This observation agrees with the phenomenon of evolution of word usage behavior, that transform individuals belonging to the same community tending to choose the same words, made by [1], and raises a question on the literature that use, without validation, LDA for content-based social link prediction over other content models. Also, semantically finer-grained content was observed to be more effective compared to coarser-grained content.},

title = {A Holistic Approach for Predicting Links in Coevolving Multiplex Networks},
year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Networks extracted from social media platforms frequently include multiple types of links that dynamically change over time; these links can be used to represent dyadic interactions such as economic transactions, communications, and shared activities. Organizing this data into a dynamic multiplex network, where each layer is composed of a single edge type linking the same underlying vertices, can reveal interesting cross-layer interaction patterns. In coevolving networks, links in one layer result in an increased probability of other types of links forming between the same node pair. Hence we believe that a holistic approach in which all the layers are simultaneously considered can outperform a factored approach in which link prediction is performed separately in each layer. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework, MLP (Multiplex Link Prediction), in which link existence likelihoods for the target layer are learned from the other network layers. These likelihoods are used to reweight the output of a single layer link prediction method that uses rank aggregation to combine a set of topological metrics. Our experiments show that our reweighting procedure outperforms other methods for fusing information across network layers.},

abstract = {Networks evolve at multiple levels; edges or relations may change, and the characteristics of the individuals within the network may change as well. Often these processes are intertwined, and in order to study them, statistical models must be developed that account for coevolution of multiple network components. The increased availability of continuous time network data has prompted new models for network inference such as the relational event framework. While network data may be continuously observable, the characteristics or state of an individual can still only be observed periodically. This type of panel data can be readily analyzed using actor-oriented models, but these methods do not accommodate continuous network data. We propose a model that integrates the relational event framework with actor-oriented models for behavioral change, allowing us to model the joint dynamics of relational events and individual states. This composite model preserves the advantages of each method, while leveraging the richer information available in relational event data. We apply our model to datasets collected from virtual team experiments to highlight the utility of our method.},

abstract = {Real world events are intrinsically dynamic and analytic techniques have to take into account this dynamism. This aspect is particularly important on complex network analysis when relations are channels for interaction events between actors. Sensing technologies open the possibility of doing so for sport networks, enabling the analysis of team performance in a standard environment and rules. Useful applications are directly related for improving playing quality, but can also shed light on all forms of team efforts that are relevant for work teams, large firms with coordination and collaboration issues and, as a consequence, economic development. In this paper, we consider dynamics over networks representing the interaction between rugby players during a match. We build a pass network and we introduce the concept of disruption network, building a multilayer structure. We perform both a global and a micro-level analysis on game sequences. When deploying our dynamic graph analysis framework on data from 18 rugby matches, we discover that structural features that make networks resilient to disruptions are a good predictor of a team's performance, both at the global and at the local level. Using our features, we are able to predict the outcome of the match with a precision comparable to state of the art bookmaking.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The opportunities to empirically study temporal networks nowadays are immense thanks to Internet of Things technologies along with ubiquitous and pervasive computing that allow a real-time fine-grained collection of social network data. This empowers data analytics and data scientists to reason about complex temporal phenomena, such as disease spread, residential energy consumption, political conflicts etc., using systematic methologies from complex networks and graph spectra analysis. However, a misuse of these methods may result in privacy-intrusive and discriminatory actions that may threaten citizens' autonomy and put their life under surveillance. This paper studies highly sparse temporal networks that model social interactions such as the physical proximity of participants in conferences. When citizens can self-determine the anonymized proximity data they wish to share via privacy-preserving platforms, temporal networks may turn out to be highly sparse and have low quality. This paper shows that even in this challenging scenario of privacy-by-design, significant information can be mined from temporal networks such as the correlation of events happening during a conference or stable groups interacting over time. The findings of this paper contribute to the introduction of privacy-preserving data analytics in temporal networks and their applications.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Modern popular TV series often develop complex storylines spanning several seasons, but are usually watched in quite a discontinuous way. As a result, the viewer generally needs a comprehensive summary of the previous season plot before the new one starts. The generation of such summaries requires first to identify and characterize the dynamics of the series subplots. One way of doing so is to study the underlying social network of interactions between the characters involved in the narrative. The standard tools used in the Social Networks Analysis field to extract such a network rely on an integration of time, either over the whole considered period, or as a sequence of several time-slices. However, they turn out to be inappropriate in the case of TV series, due to the fact the scenes showed onscreen alternatively focus on parallel storylines, and do not necessarily respect a traditional chronology. In this article, we introduce narrative smoothing, a novel, still exploratory, network extraction method. It smooths the relationship dynamics based on the plot properties, aiming at solving some of the limitations present in the standard approaches. In order to assess our method, we apply it to a new corpus of 3 popular TV series, and compare it to both standard approaches. Our results are promising, showing narrative smoothing leads to more relevant observations when it comes to the characterization of the protagonists and their relationships. It could be used as a basis for further modeling the intertwined storylines constituting TV series plots.},

On heterogeneous structure, the proposed algorithms directly search requested skills to form the subgraph of team, which achieve significant improvement in time efficiency. Experimental results suggest that our methods can form the high-quality research team, and have better efficiently compared to naive strategies and scale well with the size of the data.},

In this research, the performance of a variety of relational learners is compared by applying them to a number of CDR datasets originating from the telecommunication industry, with the goal to rank them as a whole and investigate the effects of relational classifiers and collective inference methods separately. Our results show that collective inference methods do not improve the performance of relational classifiers and the best performing relational classifier is the network-only link-based classifier, which builds a logistic model using link-based measures for the nodes in the network.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Nowadays, in the world of limited attention, the techniques that maximize the spread of social influence are more than welcomed. Companies try to maximize their profits on sales by providing customers with free samples believing in the power of word-of-mouth marketing, governments and non-governmental organizations often want to introduce positive changes in the society by appropriately selecting individuals or election candidates want to spend least budget yet still win the election. In this work we propose the use of evolutionary algorithm as a mean for selecting seeds in social networks. By framing the problem as genetic algorithm challenge we show that it is possible to outperform well-known greedy algorithm in the problem of influence maximization for the linear threshold model in both: quality (up to 16% better) and efficiency (up to 35 times faster). We implemented these two algorithms by using GPGPU approach showing that also the evolutionary algorithm can benefit from GPU acceleration making it efficient and scaling better than the greedy algorithm. As the experiments conducted by using three real world datasets reveal, the evolutionary approach proposed in this paper outperforms the greedy algorithm in terms of the outcome and it also scales much better than the greedy algorithm when the network size is increasing. The only drawback in the GPGPU approach so far is the maximum size of the network that can be processed - it is limited by the memory of the GPU card. We believe that by showing the superiority of the evolutionary approach over the greedy algorithm, we will motivate the scientific community to look for an idea to overcome this limitation of the GPU approach - we also suggest one of the possible paths to explore. Since the proposed approach is based only on topological features of the network, not on the attributes of nodes, the applications of it are broader than the ones that are dataset-specific.},

abstract = {The smart grid interconnects a power grid (network) and a communication network, and enables bi-directional flow of electricity and information. To prevent the cascading failures which occur when the disruptions in one network cause disruptions in the other network, robustness should be enhanced by increasing the number of links (edges) between the power grid and the information flow network. Given a budget which constrains the number of new links that can be added to 'strengthen' the network, the best strategy to determine where to add those new links remains an open research problem. This paper presents a multi-objective approach to identify the best locations in the power network where new links can be added, to improve the overall robustness of the smart grid when constrained by resource limitations. Simulation results show that substantially greater robustness is obtained by using this approach, when compared to other link addition algorithms.},

abstract = {We have built a tool for inspecting and managing data lakes. The motivations for creating this tool are 1) schema discovery (determining links pertinent to solving a data analysis problem), 2) discovering high risk links in data schemas that give rise to Information Security problems and 3) discovering high value relationships enabling data asset curation. The tool works by extracting metadata from the Hive database on a shared-tenancy instance of Hadoop, which contained a multi-terabyte real-world data asset. We use this metadata to calculate a graph of the relationships between the entities based on column matching. This allows us to apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques in order to discover meaningful properties of the accumulated data. For example to extract previously unknown relationships between data entities. The challenges and the agenda for future research are also provided.},

abstract = {In network science several topology-based link prediction methods have been developed so far. The classic social network link prediction approach takes as an input a snapshot of a whole network. However, with human activities behind it, this social network keeps changing. In this paper, we consider link prediction problem as a time-series problem and propose a hybrid link prediction model that combines eight structure-based prediction methods and self-adapts the weights assigned to each included method. To test the model, we perform experiments on two real world networks with both sliding and growing window scenarios. The results show that our model outperforms other structure-based methods when both precision and recall of the prediction results are considered.},

Our method seeks to intelligently select appropriate layers for aggregation to approximate communities in the whole network, while reducing the impact of over-modeling the network. Community evolution is explored as layers of different types of information are added to the partial picture of the network. We determine the set of dominant layers needed to produce similar community partitions to the established ground truth aggregate network. The identification of dominant layers enhances the selection of which layers to choose for aggregation purposes. This reduces redundancy and noise, and increases the optimization of the available data to produce the desired network partitions. We use normalized mutual index (NMI), purity, density, and modularity for methodology evaluation and comparison metrics.},

title = {Automatic Tattoo Image Registration System},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Surveillance systems are very important for law enforcement and military applications. Capturing a biometric modality at a distance and under difficult conditions is a very challenging process. While face or gait can be used to identify an individual in such application, tattoos can also help in the identification process whenever available. Tattoos are considered a soft biometric and in some scenarios may be the only clue that can be used to verify the identity of a suspect or to rule out a suspect. One of the major challenges in tattoo recognition systems is image registration, i.e. the alignment of one tattoo image to a reference image. Accurate registration can greatly improve recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a two-level automatic tattoo registration and correction system based on SIFT descriptors and the RANSAC algorithm with a homography model. By using image quality index techniques and a post-processing step (where we refine our original registration results by an automated correction process where outliers are first identified and then re-processed), our system is able to demonstrate accurate registration results. We tested our registration system using two tattoo image databases. The first one is the NIST-Tatt-C database with 109 subjects collected under uncontrolled condition, and the second one is the new WVU tattoo database (WVU-Tatt) with 79 subjects, which is collected under controlled conditions. Experimental results show that, first, we obtained 100% registration accuracy in both databases. Then, the effect of our registration process on tattoo recognition performance was assessed when using both the NIST-Tatt-C database where the accuracy improved from 54.13% (no registration) to 100% (with registration) and the WVU-Tatt database where the accuracy improved from 86.08% (no registration) to 98.73% (with registration).},

The raw stream of tweets is enriched with space information (user and mentioned locations), and sentiment (positive vs. negative) w.r.t. refugees.

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {In this work, our objective is to study the impact of statistical hypothesis tests for the purpose of improving heterogeneous face recognition (FR). A series of tests are conducted to find the most suitable type of statistical analysis test (parametric vs. non-parametric). To conduct the experiments, we used a multi-spectral face database (visible and Near-IR) collected under challenging conditions, i.e. at night time and at four different standoff distances, namely 30, 60, 90 and 120 meters. Next, the selected statistical analysis test is used to find the statistical significance of; (i) image restoration, (ii) fusion of scores. First, Gabor Wavelets, Histogram of gradients (HOG) and Local binary patterns (LBP) feature descriptors are empirically selected. Then the statistical analysis reveals which descriptors result in higher recognition performance. Finally, statistical hypothesis tests are performed to explore the impact of data stratification (grouping of gallery and probe sets) in terms of ethnicity, gender. A set of face identification studies are performed. Experimental results suggest that our proposed image restoration approach, fusion schemes and the usage of stratification result in a significantly better performance results than the baseline, e.g. the rank-one score is improved from 50% to 71% when using image restoration, to 73% when using fusion of scores and to 75% (i.e. in the case of testing FR accuracy only on the female Asian class) when employing database stratification.},

isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social influence in online social networks bears resemblance to epidemic spread in networks and has been studied through epidemiological models. The epidemic threshold is a fundamental metric used to evaluate epidemic spread in networks. Previous work has shown that the epidemic threshold of a network is exactly the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this work, however, we indicate that such a threshold ignores spatial dependence among nodes and hence underestimates the actual epidemic threshold. Focusing on regular graphs, we analytically derive a more accurate epidemic threshold based on spatial Markov dependence. Our model shows that the epidemic threshold indeed depends on the spatial correlation coefficient between neighboring nodes and decreases with the death rate. Through both analysis and simulations, we show that our proposed epidemic threshold incorporates a certain spatial dependence and thus achieves a greater accuracy in characterizing the actual epidemic threshold in regular graphs. Moreover, we extend our study to irregular graphs by conjecturing a new epidemic threshold and show that such a threshold performs significantly better than previous work.},

abstract = {Previous work introducing the idea of distribution-based network control determined that some seemingly similar networks can have significantly different levels of controllability.

These results suggest that existing structural heuristics for control set selection that do not take into account influence, such as the FAR heuristic used here and in previous network control works, can produce substandard control sets that result in poor controller performance. The development of an algorithm for control set selection based on network influence measurements is identified as an important direction of future work.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Several indices for estimating the influence of social media users have been proposed. Most such indices are obtained from the topological structure of a social network that represents relations among social media users. However, several errors are typically contained in such social network structures because of missing data, false data, or poor node/link sampling from the social network. In this paper, we investigate the effects of node sampling from a social network on the effectiveness of indices for estimating the influence of social media users. We compare the estimated influence of users, as obtained from a sampled social network, with their actual influence. Our experimental results show that using biased sampling methods, such as sample edge count, is a more effective approach than random sampling for estimating user influence, and that the use of random sampling to obtain the structure of a social network significantly affects the effectiveness of indices for estimating user influence, which may make indices useless.},

abstract = {This paper introduces two models for influence in networks, and presents some upper and lower bounds for time needed to reach stability in these models. The first, called the Majority Model, is an expansion on the "Democrats and Republicans Model" that uses cascades to initialize the influence network rather than randomly assigning each node an initial opinion. By slightly modifying a network introduced by Frischknect, Keller, and Wattenhofer [10] to fit the specifications of the Majority Model, we show that Frischknecht et al.'s lower bound for stability of [EQUATION] on the Democrats and Republicans Model also holds in the Majority Model.The second model, called the Certainty Model, is the same as the Majority Model but with the addition of a variable for a node's certainty in its own opinion. Each node weights the opinions of its neighbors by their respective certainties and moves to the mass center of all of these opinions. For the Certainty Model we obtain two upper bounds related to time to stability. The first is a bound of O(d) for the time to reach stability once all nodes have gained an opinion, where d is the diameter of the graph. The second is a bound of O(n) on the time required for all nodes to gain an opinion.},

abstract = {Social media usage has increased marginally in the last decade and it is still continuing to grow. Companies, data scientists, and researchers are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. One of the most important target applications is to find influential people in these networks. This information can serve many purposes such as; user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling.Social media is divided into subcategories like where one can share photos (i.e. Instagram, Flickr), video or music (i.e. Youtube, Last.fm), restaurant suggestions like Foursquare, or text like Twitter. Twitter is more of an idea and news sharing media than other types of social media and it has a huge amount of public profiles. These features of Twitter make it a more interesting and valuable media to research on.In this paper, we are addressing to identify topical authorities/influential users in Twitter. We provide a novel representation of users' topical interests called focus rate. We incorporate nodal features into network features and introduce a modified version of Pagerank algorithm which efficiently analyzes topical influence of users. Experimental results show that focus rate of users on specific topics increase their influence scores and lead to higher information diffusion. We use also distributed computing environment which enables to work with large data sets. We demonstrate our results on Turkish Twitter messages. For the best of our knowledge, this is the first influence analysis on Twitter that is conducted for Turkish language.},

abstract = {This paper discusses part one of the main work in field of data science, mining and analytics. Family of algorithms is developed to predict the educational relevance of individuals' talents through lens of personality features (unstructured and semi-structured) and academic/career data. The big data (unstructured and semi-structured) contains lots of valuable information that can be mined and analyzed. However, such processing and utilization of data introduce challenges of dealing with noise (irrelevant, unnecessary and redundant data). Regardless of the nature of data processing and utilization for a given problem or an application, noise adds unnecessary time and cost. This paper briefly discusses the overall research work and then presents Noise Removal and Structured Data Detection (NR-and-SDD) algorithm and related math construct. NR-and-SDD detects the noise to reduce the processing cost and improve structured data detection in relevance of personality features. The given results show improved reliability and efficiency of NR and SDD processes. Related study is provided and paper is concluded with final remarks and future works.},

abstract = {Determining the frequencies and the distribution of small subgraph patterns in a large input graph is an important part of many graph based mining tasks such as Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM) and Motif Detection. Due to the exponential number of such graph patterns the interpretation of the mining results is mostly limited to finding unexpectedly frequent patterns, and in general identifying few particularly interesting patterns to then understand their function in the network. However, the full distribution of patterns itself encodes much more information about the underlying graph. Looking at this pattern distribution could be of particular interest in Social Network Analysis because social networks seem to have more random noise and less hard structural constraints compared to other types of graphs. This makes it unlikely to find meaning in only the most frequent patterns. In this paper we contribute in two ways to the usage of pattern distributions in networks analysis. First, we introduce two different sampling-based algorithms for computing the mentioned pattern distributions. Second we sketch two original ideas which can be used to harness the information in pattern distributions for gaining insights on global and local properties of Social Networks.},

abstract = {Big social data is becoming an important part of human decision making around the world. With the high stakes of decisions based on technical systems, it is important to evaluate the role of researchers in shaping that shared future. I present the results of a survey of 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining participants who performed big social data analyses. The goal was to understand how data scientists use interpretation to complete their projects and how they communicate results to their audience. By looking at research design as both a technical roadmap and an argument, results generated from social media data sets can be evaluated for their quality. Ultimately, these results will assist in the creation of field-dependent evaluation standards than can be used by big social data researchers.},

Many of the research in this area is oriented towards social network analysis. These collections are based on formal ways of expression and unfortunately social networks content is not always formal. There is an increasing use of informal, many times regional language popularly called slang. We propose a Game With a Purpose (GWAP) system to facilitate the collection of informal terms. Leveraging on social interactions we seek to obtain a lexicon that is more suitable for social media related analysis.},

It is the most common online risk for adolescents and well over half of young people do not tell their parents when it occurs. While there have been many studies about the nature and prevalence of cyberbullying, there has been relatively less work in the area of automated identification of cyberbullying in social media sites. The focus of our work is to develop an automated model to identify and measure the degree of cyberbullying in social networking sites, and a Facebook app for parents, built on this model, that notifies them when cyberbullying occurs. This paper describes the challenges associated with building a computer model for cyberbullying identification, presents key results from psychology research that can be used in such a model, describes an initial model and mobile app design for cyberbullying identification, and describes key areas of future work to improve upon the initial model.},

In this paper, we study influence from the perspective of structure, and focus on the simplest group structure---triad. We analyze two different genres of behavior: Retweeting on Weibo1 and Paying on CrossFire2. We have several intriguing observations from these two networks. First, different internal structures of one's friends exhibit significant heterogeneity in influence patterns. Second, the strength of social relationship plays an important role in influencing one's behavior, and more interestingly, it is not necessarily positively correlated with the strength of social influence. We incorporate the triadic influence patterns into a predictive model to predict user's behavior. Experiment results show that our method can significantly improved the prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {The realization that scholarly publications are discussed and have influence on discourse outside scientific and academic domains has given rise to area of scientometrics called alternative metrics or "altmetrics". Furthermore, researchers in this field tend to focus primarily on measuring scientific activity on social media platforms such as Twitter, however these count-based metrics are vulnerable to gaming because they tend to lack concrete justification or reference to the primary source. In this collaboration with Elsevier, we extend the conventional citation graph to a heterogeneous graph of publications, scientists, venues, organizations and more authoritative media sources such as mainstream news and weblogs. Our approach consists of two parts: one is integrating the bibliometric data with the social data such as blogs, mainstream news. The other involves understanding how standard graph-based metrics can be used to predict the academic impact. Our result showed the computed graph-based metrics can reasonably predict the academic impact of early stage researchers.},

To do that, we adapted these sentence-level methods to run on Android OS and then we measure their performance in terms of memory usage, CPU usage, and battery consumption. Our findings unveil sentence-level methods that require almost no adaptations and run relatively fast as well as methods that could not be deployed due to excessive use of memory. We hope our effort provides a guide to developers and researchers interested in exploring sentiment analysis as part of a mobile application and can help new applications to be executed without the dependency of a server-side API.},

We thus define the troll vulnerability prediction problem, where given a post we aim at predicting whether it is vulnerable to trolling. Towards this end, we define a novel troll vulnerability metric of how likely a post is to be attacked by trolls, and we construct models for predicting troll-vulnerable posts, using features from the content and the history of the post. Our experiments with real data from Reddit demonstrate that our approach is successful in recalling a large fraction of the troll-vulnerable posts.},

The proposed system learns the word usage model for each word in the confusing word group and a universal difficulty model for all sentences, in order to propose simple but clear example sentences for learners.

In general, the main challenge of mental disorders is that they remain difficult to detect on suffering patients. In an online environment, the challenge extends to the collection of patients data and the implementation of proper algorithms to assist in the detection of such illnesses. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection mechanism and build predictive models that leverage language and behavioral patterns, used particularly on Twitter, to determine whether a user is suffering from a mental disorder. After training the predictive models, they are further pre-trained to serve as the back-end for our demonstration, MIDAS. MIDAS offers an analytics web-service to explore several characteristics pertaining to user's linguistic and behavioral patterns on social media, with respect to mental illnesses.},

In this study, we present the Personal Online Social Network (POSN) app that implements a cloud-backed peer-to-peer decentralized OSN using mobile devices. In POSN, each user utilizes a storage cloud to store and distribute encrypted content to his/her friends. Direct key management allows the user to have fine-grained access control of the shared content, and protects the data from being accessed by third parties. The POSN app is available at https://github.com/posn/POSN-app.},

abstract = {The advancements in wearable technology, where embedded accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors enable the users to actively monitor their activity have made it easier for individuals to pursue a healthy lifestyle. However, most of the existing applications expect continuous commitment from the end users, who need to proactively interact with the application in order to connect with friends and attain their goals. These applications fail to engage and motivate users who have busy schedules, or are not as committed and self-motivated. In this work, we present PRO-Fit, a personalized fitness assistant application that employs machine learning and recommendation algorithms in order to smartly track and identify user's activity, synchronizes with the user's calendar, recommends personalized workout sessions based on the user's preferences, fitness goals, and availability. Moreover, PRO-Fit integrates with the user's social network and recommends "fitness buddies" with similar preferences and availability.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},

abstract = {User profiling from user generated content (UGC) is a common practice that supports the business models of many social media companies. Existing systems require that the UGC is fully exposed to the module that constructs the user profiles. In this paper we show that it is possible to build user profiles without ever accessing the user's original data, and without exposing the trained machine learning models for user profiling - which are the intellectual property of the company - to the users of the social media site. We present VirtualIdentity, an application that uses secure multi-party cryptographic protocols to detect the age, gender and personality traits of users by classifying their user-generated text and personal pictures with trained support vector machine models in a privacy preserving manner.},

year = {2016},
isbn = {9781509028467},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The risks due to a global and unaware diffusion of our personal data cannot be overlooked when more than two billion people are estimated to be registered in at least one of the most popular online social networks. As a consequence, privacy has become a primary concern among social network analysts and Web/data scientists. Some studies propose to "measure" users' profile privacy according to their privacy settings but do not consider the topological properties of the social network adequately. In this paper, we address this limitation and define a centrality-based privacy score to measure the objective user privacy risk according to the network properties. We analyze the effectiveness of our measures on a large network of real Facebook users.},
