abstract = {Blogs are popular communication instruments in today's web and altogether, they form the so-called blogosphere. This blogosphere has repeatedly been subject to structural analyses, and one of the findings has been the discovery of the A-List phenomenon, a cohesive group of influential blogs in the center of the blogosphere, whose exact identification remained an open issue. We use four language-specific subsets of the blogosphere, for which we aggregated the blogroll-based networks. We adapt core theory to analyse and compare the cohesion in these four data-sets, and provide a new scalable method for the identification of core-periphery structures in blog networks, which can contribute to identify A-List blogs more reliably.},

The subjects were the employees in the bureau of health and three health stations. They were asked about the personal innovativeness and the relations with their colleagues including the director, and vice director. The questions to uncover important network relationship included knowledge awareness, access, and problem solving. UCINET6 was applied to analyze the social network data and constraint and efficiency were used as the indicators of structural hole. Of the 118 questionnaires distributed, a total of 81 effective responses were received, showing a 68.6% response rate. The result showed that the higher efficiency the more innovativeness. It is concluded that social network with rich structural holes provides opportunities for having time and energy to be innovative. Managerial implication and future research were discussed.},

abstract = {Organizational learning is a research topic very relevant in strategic studies. Nevertheless, the way in which learning takes place in the firm constitutes one of the main gaps in research. For this reason, this paper wants to explain how learning occurs in a company. A case study of a Spanish high-tech company is used to explore the network perspective on intraorganizational learning. It expands the generalization of the network perspective to intra-organizational learning, as proposed by \v{S}kerlavaj and Dimovski (2006). We formulated four propositions based on an exploratory social network analysis. We provide additional arguments for the generalization of the research findings related to the importance of industry experience and company tenure as determinants of the key players in learning networks. The novel contribution of this study relates to the complementarity of knowledge as a tie generator and shows the importance of cross-departmental knowledge flows in projects.Moreover, similarity in terms of experiential level and physical proximity creates opportunities to learn. From a practice-oriented perspective, this study offers tools for detecting the most important employees in a firm from a learning viewpoint.},

Fortunately, opinions from friends in a social network are more reliable but less convenient to obtain. Combining the advantages of online reviews and opinions from friends can be achieved by enabling users to recognize the online reviews originating from their friends. By leveraging buyers’ trust to nearby friends within their social network, it is possible to provide them in some cases with online reviews they can entirely trust. In this paper we present techniques to enable users to recognize the online reviews from their friends in a privacy-preserving manner. Our approach has many applications such as Internet auctions and online gaming.},

However, the relationship between technology use and social network use has not been investigated; understanding this relationship is important when considering the design of technology applications that support existing social networks. Contrary to Robert Putnam’s hypothesis that technologies have an "individualizing" force on populations, we have found that social network patterns do not appear to be negatively associated with higher technology use. In fact, the higher the level of technology use, the more face-to-face social networks were used for multiple types of information seeking.},

abstract = {In a rapidly changing environment, a shift toward decentralized structurefor organizations seems inevitable. Semantic web Technologies combined with social network analysis make the transition of a centralized organization to a decentralized one much easier. By increasing controllability and manageability of a decentralized structure, these tools can improve functionality and performance. A framework for creation and maintenance of a semantic social network is introduced and two real world organizations have been analyzed. After selecting one organization suitable for decentralization, network datasets were generated from its structure. Generated datasets have been used as the input of the framework to create a semantic social network for the corresponding organization. Social network analysis was then performed on both semantic and non semantic social networks. Gain of performance was observed in many areas such as decision making, flexibility, reliability and throughput. Semantic social network also enables other functionalities along ease of decentralization such as gain of knowledge about dynamic structure of the organization. These functionalities are also discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a horizontal view of social influence, more specifically a quantitative study of the influence of neighbours on the probability of a particular node to join a group, on four popular Online Social Networks (OSNs), namely Orkut, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Flickr. Neighbours in OSNs have a mutually acknowledged relation, most often defined as friendship, and they are directly connected on a graph of a social network. Users in OSNs can also join groups of users. These groups represent common areas of interest.We present a simple social influence model to describe and explain the group joining process of users on OSNs. To this end, we extract the social influence from data sets ofOSNs of a million sample nodes. One of our findings is that a set of neighbours in the OSN is about $100$ times more powerful in influencing a user to join a group than the same number of strangers.},

Based on empirical data of four social networks, we compare a widely-used approximation with our own measures of collaborative intensity.We find that the quality of the approximation varies with the type of social networks.},

The clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio,two commonly used measures effectively quantify the triangle density in order to quantify the fact that friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Furthermore, several successful graph mining applications rely on the number of triangles. In this paper, we study the problem of counting triangles in large, power-law networks. Our algorithm, SparcifyingEigenTriangle, relies on the spectral properties of power-law networks and the Achlioptas-McSherry sparsification process. SparcifyingEigenTriangle is easy to parallelize, fast and accurate.We verify the validity of our approach with several experiments in real-world graphs, where we achieve at the same time high accuracy and important speedup versus a straight-forward exact counting competitor.},

abstract = {Research has shown that many social networks come into being hierarchically based on some basic building blocks called communities, within which the social interactions are very intensive, but between which they are very weak. Network community mining algorithms aim at efficiently and effectively discovering all such communities from a given network. Many related methods have been proposed and applied to different areas including social network analysis, gene network analysis and web clustering engine. Most of the existing methods for mining communities are centralized. In this paper, we present a multi-agent based decentralized algorithm, in which a group of autonomous agents work together to mine a network through a proposed self-aggregation and self-organization mechanism. Thanks to its decentralized feature, our method is potentially suitable for dealing with distributed networks, whose global structures are hard to obtain due to their geographical distributions, decentralized controls or huge sizes. The effectiveness of our method has been tested against different benchmark networks.},

In a virtual world, users are represented by so-called avatars. These avatars move around the virtual world, communicate with each other,and interact with the virtual world. The movements of these avatars can be tracked precisely, and useful information can be inferred from analyzing these movements. In this paper, we analyze a large data set (&gt;200 million records) of position data describing the movements of avatars in the virtual world Second Life.The dataset was derived from in-world sensors that had been deployed beforehand, but also so-called bots can be used to gather such information. From this data, we can track usage patterns of avatars (and therefore users) overtime. We can also identify regions of high interest where a large number of users gather frequently (which would be important for planning advertising in the virtual world), and visualize this statistical analysis using heat maps. By combining the position data with information about the language spoken by the avatars, we can label these regions according to the language predominantly spoken there. Analyzing incidents of co-location of avatars over a period of time, we can automatically infer friends, and eventually social networks. Using additional metadata such as language we can label clusters in this automatically generated social network.},

In this paper, we proposed a novel method based on analysis of dynamic user behavior data for the notion that users’ behaviors in social tagging system can reflect the quality of tags more accurately. Through modeling the different categories of participants’ behaviors, we extract tag-associated actions which can be used to estimate whether tag is spam, and then present our algorithm that can filter the tag spam in the results of social search. The experiment results show that our method indeed outperforms the existing methods based on static data and effectively defends against the tag spam in various spam attacks.},

We evaluate our measure using two real world affiliation networks: a senate bill cosponsorship network and a dolphin network. The results show how the behavior of actors in different affiliation groups change dynamically over time, reinforcing the utility of our measure for understanding the loyalty of actors to time-varying affiliation groups.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for social network discovery based on the sensitivity coefficients of importance metrics, namely the Markov centrality of a node, a metric based on random walks. Analogous to node importance, which ranks the important nodes in a social network, the sensitivity analysis of this metric provides a ranking of the relationships between nodes. The sensitivity parameter of the importance of a node with respect to another measures the direct or indirect impact of a node. We show that these relationships help discover hidden links between nodes and highlight meaningful links between seemingly disparate sub-networks in a social structure. We introduce the notion of implicit links, which represent an indirect relationship between nodes not connected by edges, seen as hidden connections in complex networks. We demonstrate our methodology on two social network data sets and use sensitivity-guided visualizations to highlight our findings. Our results show that this analytic tool, when coupled with visualization, is an effective mechanism for discovering social networks.},

An intelligent recommendation system can be used in a social networking site in order to recommend people according to content and collaboration assessment. This study is an effort to recommend events to users within a social networking site. It can be any networking environment. We have used social environment that has been designed as a facebook application. Our application has also been integrated with several web sites. System collects event data from several related web sites either by using web services or web scraping. It also permits users rating events they have attended or planned. Given the social network between people, system tries to recommend upcoming events to users. For this purpose a combination of content based and collaborative filtering has been used. We have also taken geographical location info and social concept of an event.},

abstract = {In this paper we use the social networks of active members (i.e. authors) in online communities to predict their future behavior. We limit our discussion to web forums, the most generic type of online communities. We first address the problem of measuring the ties between authors where there is (almost) no direct information (i.e. citations) about the tie between two authors. We developed a surrogate metrics to this problem so that a corresponding social network can be constructed. However, while such networks are suitable for describing authors' behavior, they are not very suitable for predicting their future behavior. Here we suggest a very specific method for creating networks of authors that is specially designed for prediction. The main characteristic of our approach is that we take into account all available data while putting more weight on more recent data (messages). In addition to networks of authors, we also use the two-mode network of threads (topics) to generate predictions.All network data and other information related to the posting habits of the authors are thus used to develop an algorithm that predicts the future behavior of the authors. The ultimate goal of our research is to generate explicit recommendations for authors of online communities about which authors and which topics/threads to follow. Finally, these predictions/recommendations can be used as the basis for a more user-friendly forum interface.},

We use real field data from food safety domain to illustrate the discussion. We model food production facilities as one type of entities in a social network evolving in time. Another type of entities denotes various specific strains of Salmonella. Two entities are linked in the graph if a microbial test of food sample conducted at the specific food facility over specific period of time turns out positive for the particular pathogen. We use a computationally efficient latent space model to predict future occurrences of pathogens in individual facilities. Empirical results indicate predictive utility of the proposed representation. However, sparseness of data limits the attainable agility of predictions. We identify exploiting recency of data and using the known patterns in it, such as seasonality, as plausible means of battling the challenge of sparseness.},

The network which is used to demonstrate the proposed prediction method is composed of academic co-authors who collaborated on writing articles. Without loss of generality, the academic co-authoring network demonstrates the proposed prediction procedure due to its similarity to other networks, such as business co-operation networks. The results show that the best prediction is achieved by incorporating TDM with SNA.},

The software used a time-slice interval of 30 days for Clinton stories because the average days between Gallup presidential job approval poll ratings was 30 days, resulting in 97 time slices. For Bush the average number of days between polls was 22 days, resulting in a 132-point time series. This synchronized the social networks with presidential job approval ratings. Clinton and Bush had nearly opposite relationships between network centrality and job approval.Automatic network analysis of social actors from textual corpora is feasible and enables testing hypotheses over time.},

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation technique. However, classical CF systems use only direct links and common features to model relationships between users. This paper presents a new Collaborative Filtering approach (BNCF) based on a behavioral network that uses navigational patterns to model relationships between users and exploits social networks techniques, such as transitivity, to explore additional links throughout the behavioral network. The final aim consists in involving these new links in prediction generation, to improve recommendations quality. BNCF is evaluated in terms of accuracy on a real usage dataset. The experimentation shows the benefit of exploiting new links to compute predictions. Indeed, BNCF highly improves the accuracy of predictions, especially in terms of HMAE.},

abstract = {The cost of postsecondary education in the U. S. continues to grow faster than salaries and inflation. In fact, the real cost of a college education has climbed almost 30 in the past 10 years and shows no sign of stabilizing in the near future. The economic competitiveness of the country increasingly depends on a skilled workforce with a postsecondary education capable of dealing with the demands of the global market. Thus, college attainment is at the center of producing a skilled workforce, and so it is, postsecondary education affordability. Using the National Postsecondary Student Aid Surveyor the year 2003- 2004, which is representative of the entire undergraduate population in the U.S., this study examines the various ways students and families pay for postsecondary education and its subsequent effect on persistence and performance for all groups of students across racial/ethnic and social-economic status lines.We use a spectral clustering algorithm based on Normalized cuts to classify students based on their similarities. More specifically, we construct a social network with the students as the nodes of the graph and edge between pair of the students is weighted based on their similarity in attributes. We then obtain three non-trivial smallestof the laplacian matrix. We use these to perform a k-means clustering in the eigenspace. We were able to establish meaningful clusters by this approach that helps in classifying students based on the relation between their persistence level and conditions of living.},

We found that the relationships among positions in both molecules displayed a complex topology. In addition, the degree distribution of each network adequately fit a power law distribution, with a small number of vertices dominating a large number of associations. The graphs for both proteins shared similar topological features despite differences in protein size, similarity, functionality, and location of the coding regions in the potyviral genome. Our findings suggest that the intramolecular associations of potyviral proteins display scale free architecture, implying that this system may undergo developmental processes similar to those described for other scale free systems.},

One can then discover communities of products that are bought together, which can lead to expressive exploration and discovery of a larger influence zone of product(s). We develop a novel utility measure for communities of products and show, both financially and intuitively, that community detection provides a useful complement to association rules for market basket analysis.

abstract = {Large scale simulation studies, such as routing in communication systems, rely on complex networks. However, the specific network structure of the application domain is often neglected in analysing network behaviour with the consequence of limited ability to conduct a sensitivity analyses. Network evolution models have been developed to account for structural properties of social graphs, such as the Internet, and enable a model-based analysis on different scales. Despite some analytical results with respect to queueing metrics, little work has been done to frame network evolution models in the context of queuing systems. This paper addresses this issue discussing social and random network evolution models and their application to queueing systems. When the stability criterion holds, analytical solutions using Jackson's Theorem and Little's Law exist and provide valuable insights into a number of queueing performance metrics. Specifically, a sensitivity analysis of the mean total waiting time versus the utilisation is carried out which shows a significant difference between the social and random network models. Understanding the impact of the structural features of complex networks is important in the design of simulation studies and operating real world systems. This is especially true when adaptive algorithms are employed and insights of their performance compared to analytical scenarios are required.},

This gap is filled by our proposal of a concept which is composed of a universal description model, temporal network definitions, and a measurement system.

abstract = {Adjacency relations for social network analysis have usually been tackled in their bidimensional form, in the sense that relations are computed over pairs of objects. Nevertheless, this paper considers the bidimensional case as restrictive and it proposes an approach where the dimension of the analysis is not limited to binary relations. With the aid of fuzzy logic and OWA operators, it is showed that the interpretation of m-ary adjacency relations is the same of binary relations and therefore they can consistently be employed in social network analysis and some novel results be derived. Besides justifying the use of m-ary relations, the paper proposes a way to characterize them and, eventually, it will provide the reader with an example section.},

abstract = {The increased online presence of jihadists has raised the possibility of individuals being radicalised via the Internet. To date, the study of violent radicalisation has focused on dedicated jihadist websites and forums. This may not be the ideal starting point for such research, as participants in these venues may be described as "already made-up minds". Crawling a global social networking platform, such as YouTube, on the other hand, has the potential to unearth content and interaction aimed at radicalisation of those with little or no apparent prior interest in violent jihadism. This research explores whether such an approach is indeed fruitful. We collected a large dataset from a group within YouTube thatwe identified as potentially having a radicalising agenda. Weanalysed this data using social network analysis and sentiment analysis tools, examining the topicsdiscussed and what the sentiment polarity (positive or negative) is towards these topics. In particular, we focus on gender differences in this group of users, suggesting most extreme and less tolerant views among female users.},

However, most existing approaches require complete information of the graph in question, which is impractical for some networks, e.g. the World Wide Web (WWW). Algorithms for local community detection have been proposed but their results usually contain many outliers. In this paper, we propose a new measure of local community structure, coupled with a two-phase algorithm that extracts all possible candidates first, and then optimizes the community hierarchy. We compare our results with previous methods on real world networks such as the co-purchase network from Amazon. Experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

The aim of our study is to determine the music preferences of people and to observe how the taste in music changes over time. Over a period of 130 weeks, we extract for each interval user profiles of 1,800 users that represent their music listening behavior. By building and incrementally clustering a graph of similar users, we obtain groups of people with similar music preferences. We label these clusters with genres according to the user profiles of the cluster members. Due to the incremental nature of DENGRAPH we show how clusters evolve over time. Besides the growth and decrease of clusters we observe how new clusters emerge and old clusters die. Furthermore, we show the merge and split of clusters. The results of our experiments indicate that DENGRAPH is particularly useful to efficiently detect groups of similar users and to track them over time.},

However, real-world social networks are sometimes too complex for human to pursue further analysis. In this work, an unsupervised mechanism is proposed for egocentric information abstraction in heterogeneous social networks. To achieve this goal, we propose a vector space representation for heterogeneous social networks to identify linear combination of relations as features and compute statistical dependencies as feature values. Then we design several abstraction criteria to distill representative and important information to construct the abstracted graphs for visualization. The evaluations conducted on a real world movie dataset and an artificial crime dataset demonstrate that the abstractions can indeed retain important information and facilitate more accurate and efficient human analysis.},

abstract = {In this paper we will demonstrate the potential of processing and visualising the dynamics of computer-mediated communities by means of Social Network Analysis. According to the fact that computer-mediated community systems are manifested also as structured data, we use data structures like e-mail, discussion boards, and bibliography sources for an automatic transformation into social network data formats. Currently our developed converter DMD (Data Multiplexer Demultiplexer) supports GraphML, UCINET, and Pajek formats besides our own data formats which are used for real-time analysis of CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) activities. In the case of communication data our converters utilize conversation graphs reflecting aspects of speech act and conversational theory to produce directed graphs in the cases where one-mode person networks are desired. The paper will demonstrate a 3-dimensional visualisation of an author community based on Bibtex bibliography data converted into GraphML. Based on this dataset we visualise publications network with a tool called Weaver, which is developed in our research group. According to Lothar Krempel’s algorithm, Weaver uses the first two dimensions to embed the network structure within a common solution space. The third dimension is used for representing the time axis and thus the dynamics of co-authorship relations.Concluding we aim to discuss potential issues and problems of our approach and the possibilities especially concerning the appropriate visualisation and segmentation of long term communications, such as mailing lists.},

abstract = {The “wisdom of the crowds” is a concept used to describe the utility of harnessing group behaviour, where user opinion evolves over time and the opinion of the masses collectively demonstrates wisdom. Web 2.0 is a new medium where users are not just consumers, but are also contributors.By contributing content to the system, users become part of the network and relationships between users and content can be derived. Example applications are collaborative bookmarking networks such as del.icio.us and file sharing applications such as YouTube and Flickr. These networks rely on user contributed content, described and classified using tags. The wealth of user generated content can be hard to navigate and search due to difficulties in comparing documents with similar tags and the application of traditional information retrieval scoring techniques are limited. Evaluating the time evolving interests of users maybe used to derive quality of content. In this paper, we propose a technique to rank documents based on reputation. The reputation is a combination of the number of bookmarkers, the reputation of the bookmarking user and the time dynamics of the document.Experimental results and analysis are presented on a large collaborative IBM bookmarking network called Dogear.},

This paper illustrates the former. The approach adds some predicates to the CREATE TABLE command to capture common corporate-based user privacy requirements, such as purpose, generalization, and retention, required by social networks desiring to support privacy. Hence, the corporation, when creating the underlying databases, defines what the mandatory privacy policies are with which all users must comply. The extension is supported with underlying catalogues, algorithms, and prototype. The key contribution is a low-cost mechanism to develop new systems—that are privacy-preserved—and to transform legacy database MAC models to their privacy preserving equivalents. Although our examples are from social networks, the results apply to data security and user privacy of other enterprises too.},

Some applications link to licensed information resources which can cost thousands of dollars per year to license. As a result, examining application usage data can help generate information on the relative cost effectiveness of the resources for which clients pay. This study presents an initial analysis of data by grouped resource applications as a means of determining whether deeper analysis is warranted.Data was warehoused and mined using a Microsoft Business intelligence tool (cube), using predetermined dimensions. By warehousing and mining desktop application usage through DTs,previously hidden usage patterns were uncovered. The DT experiments revealed various application usage patterns both within and between the desktops. Usergroups within each environment also demonstrated different access patterns at different times. Based on this analysis, further drilling down is warranted to uncover patterns of particular resource use.Exercises such as these will help predict future user behavior and facilitate the planning of desktop resource provision.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the method we have created for the purpose of identifying misbehavior of users who intends to generate false trends in digital maps. Basically, the idea is to identify patterns of communities of users who strongly contribute with reports that lead a particular geographic area to be considered a hot spot. The association between hot spots, computed from Kernel Density Estimation techniques, and the methods for identifying communities in social networks is the main innovation of the method proposed. A multi-agent system was built in order to simulate several scenarios of malicious activities. This method has shown to be effective for alerting the possibility of malicious activity in a real system.},

The criterion to locate hubs or outliers is network dependent. Previous methods usually require this information as input parameters, e.g., an expected number of communities, with no intuition or assistance. Here we present a visual data mining approach, which first helps the user to make appropriate parameter selections by observing initial data visualizations, and then finds and extracts overlapping community structures from the network. Experimental results verify the scalability and accuracy of our approach on real network data and show its advantages over previous methods.},

Data instances distributed with URIs, those that enable identification and combination of data instances, can be consumed with shared data vocabularies. Easy and intuitive access to the data should be provided for data-centered uses of the Web. This paper introduces a linked data browser providing an intuitive view, especially helping casual users’ understanding of data instances and their relationships. The browser also satisfies the requirement of a generic browser: handling unexpected domains of data across the links. By adapting user’s perspectives captured during browsing, the browser enables users to view any types of linked data instances with different views pertinent to their intentions and types of data.},

abstract = {We envision new communication paradigms, using physical dynamic interconnectedness among people. Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a new communication paradigm to support such network environments, and our focus is a type of DTN that provides intermittent communication for humans carrying mobile devices: the Pocket Switched Network (PSN). Information propagation in PSNs is highly influenced by human connectivity networks, i.e. social networks. In our previous work, we have exploited constructing weighted networks using characteristics of pair connections such as the duration of contact time and frequency of contacts from time series of human connectivity network traces. The approach we took is based on empirical and heuristic and the focus is finding a single aggregated logical network structure. The physical network topology in the real world is time dependent and it is a complex task to describe its dynamics. This paper aims to identify dynamics of meeting groups in human connectivity traces, where meeting groups are expected to be a group interacting among the nodes in physical space. Thus, we define ‘meeting group’ differently from ‘community’. We exploit statistical approach that provides quantitative attributes to uncover meeting groups. We identify the power law behavior of meetings that is important for supporting to understanding dynamics of information flow between meeting groups and building group oriented communication protocol.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of internet has transformed the way relationships between companies and their customers. To find the implicit social network and form customer club (community) for customers is a critical requirement in some businesses. The social role analysis attempts to find explicit similarities between actors in the network. Traditional clustering methods based on attributes between actors lack for logic foundation. In this paper, we apply rough set theory to partition objects into equivalence classes interpreting the hidden community. This paper proposes a framework to find the implicit social network based on rough set theory and frame logic to extract and express the social structure and relationship. The development framework includes three levels, i.e. conceptual level, logical level and validation level. In conceptual level, we explore the properties of social network. The logic and validation is based on frame logic. The interface of different level is a mapping from a source model to a target model using a set of transformation rules. Finally, we apply FLORID tools to evaluate the correctness and the adequacy of the model.},

Hence, each user can discretionarily control the set of privileges over the view representing their profile.

There is a need to understand not only what a framework could help conducting on-line problem-based learning but also learner’s professional networks. The purpose of this study was to explore both feasibility and knowledge-reuse networking of on-line problem-based learning. Based on literature review, a theory framework was identified. An implementation of this framework was conducted to verify the feasibility. Knowledge-reuse network was constructed according to on-line activity log. For the framework of on-line PBL, the results of the evaluation conducted in this study imply that the feasibility exists. For the knowledge-reuse network, the higher group density tends to acts with higher reuse frequency. It was conclude that both in-degree and out-degree of knowledge-reuse networks index are significant predictor of PBL learning achievement of out learners.},

One of the interesting questions was if we could find a minimum base of proverbs as an indicator to decide from which place a person came due to their specific profile of proverbial knowledge. Before trying this challenge, we will analyse, in this article, the probability of achieving such an idea by trying to find out if a homomorphism between the proverbial knowledge and the geographical location of a person could exist.To solve this question, we chose an approach based on the analysis of social networks where the broadcast of oral culture, at least historically, could be interpreted as a trace of direct social contact between some of their users. We found, in the present pilot-project based on small data sets, that there are clusters where the neighbourhood relation inducted by the minimum Hamming Distance could be a reflex of the geographical distribution and of some migration flux of the population.},

But there is a need to define a unified framework for finding and visualizing substructures from graph. In this paper we propose a graph mining framework that captures entities and relations between entities from different data sources. The framework further models this data as a graph and facilitates the dense substructure extraction and frequent substructure discovery in order to find substructures.

abstract = {Many factors affected the supply chain network are almost based on inter-organizational relationships (IORs). Few supply chain scholars used social network analysis (SNA) to map communication between partners and figure out the supply chain network communication pattern, especially automobile industry. With SNA, the study finds out core-periphery structure, and explores four sub-groups (competition, co-design and developing, knowledge-sharing and proprietorship) in a large automobile network. Centrality is associated with perceived organizational function positively. The research suggested that perceptions of organizational performance are associated with the position in the network; central firms are more likely to perceive the organization performs well than those on the periphery.},
