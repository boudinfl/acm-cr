abstract = {In recent years, the amount of information shared (both implicit and explicit) between traditional news media and social media sources like Twitter has grown at a prolific rate. Traditional news media is dependent on social media to help identify emerging developments; social media is dependent on news media to supply information in certain categories. In this paper, we present a principled framework for understanding their symbiotic relationship, with the goal of (1) understanding the type of information flow between news articles and the Twitterverse by classifying it into four states; (2) chaining similar news articles together to form story chains and extracting interaction patterns for each story chain in terms of interaction states of news articles in the story chain, and (3) identifying major interaction patterns by clustering story chains and understanding their differences by identifying main topics of interest within such clusters.},

abstract = {Social media is rapidly becoming one of the mediums of choice for understanding the cultural pulse of a region; e.g., for identifying what the population is concerned with and what kind of help is needed in a crisis. To assess this cultural pulse it is critical to have an accurate assessment of who is saying what in social media. However, social media is also the home of malicious users engaged in disruptive, disingenuous, and potentially illegal activity. A range of users, both human and non-human, carry out such social cyber-attacks. We ask, to what extent does the presence or absence of such users influence our ability to assess the cultural pulse of a region? We conduct a series of experiments to analyze the fragility of social network assessments based on Twitter data by comparing changes in both the structural and content results when suspended users are left in and taken out. Because a Twitter account can be suspended for various reasons including spamming or spreading ideas that can lead to extremism or terrorism, we separately assess the impacts of removing apparent spam bots and apparent extremists. Experimental results demonstrate that Twitter-based network structures and content are unstable, and can be highly impacted by the removal of suspended users. Further, the results exhibit regional and temporal variation that may be related to the political situation or civil unrest. We also provides guidance on the differential impact of different types of potentially suspendable users.},

abstract = { 'Firestorms,' sudden bursts of negative attention in cases of controversy and outrage, are seemingly widespread on Twitter and are an increasing source of fascination and anxiety in the corporate, governmental, and public spheres. Using media mentions, we collect 80 candidate events from January 2011 to September 2014 that we would term 'firestorms.' Using data from the Twitter decahose (or gardenhose), a 10% random sample of all tweets, we describe the size and longevity of these firestorms. We take two firestorm exemplars, #myNYPD and #CancelColbert, as case studies to describe more fully. Then, taking the 20 firestorms with the most tweets, we look at the change in mention networks of participants over the course of the firestorm as one method of testing for possible impacts of firestorms. We find that the mention networks before and after the firestorms are more similar to each other than to those of the firestorms, suggesting that firestorms neither emerge from existing networks, nor do they result in lasting changes to social structure. To verify this, we randomly sample users and generate mention networks for baseline comparison, and find that the firestorms are not associated with a greater than random amount of change in mention networks.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Twitter and Facebook have become a significant testing ground for Artificial Intelligence developers who build programs, known as socialbots, that imitate actual users by automating their social-network activities such as forming social links and posting content. Particularly, Twitter users have shown difficulties in distinguishing these socialbots from the human users in their social graphs. Frequently, legitimate users engage in conversations with socialbots. More impressively, socialbots are effective in acquiring human users as followers and exercising influence within them. While the success of socialbots is certainly a remarkable achievement for AI practitioners, their proliferation in the Twitter-sphere opens many possibilities for cybercrime. The proliferation of socialbots in the Twitter-sphere motivates us to assess the characteristics or strategies that make socialbots most likely to succeed. In this direction, we created 120 socialbot accounts in Twitter, which have a profile, follow other users, and generate tweets either by reposting messages that others have posted or by creating their own synthetic tweets. Then, we employ a 2k factorial design experiment in order to quantify the infiltration effectiveness of different socialbot strategies. Our analysis is the first of a kind, and reveals what strategies make socialbots successful in the Twitter-sphere.},

abstract = {Influence models enable the modelling of the spread of ideas, opinions and behaviours in social networks. Bounded rationality in social network suggests that players make non optimum decisions due to the limitations of access to information. Based on the premise that adopting a state or an idea can be regarded as being 'rational', we propose an influence model based on the heterogeneous bounded rationality of players in a social network. We employ the quantal response equilibrium model to incorporate the bounded rationality in the context of social influence. The bounded rationality of following a seed or adopting the strategy of a seed would be negatively proportional to the distance from that node. This indicates that the closeness centrality would be the appropriate measure to place influencers in a social network. We argue that this model can be used in scenarios where there are multiple types of influencers and varying payoffs of adopting a state. We compare different seed placement mechanisms to compare and contrast the optimum method to minimise the existing social influence in a network when there are multiple and conflicting seeds. We ascertain that placing of opposing seeds according to a measure derived from a combination of the betweenness centrality values from the seeds and the closeness centrality of the network would provide the maximum negative influence.},

abstract = {Often in marketing, political campaigns and social media, two competing products or opinions propagate over a social network. Studying social influence in such competing cascades scenarios enables building effective strategies for maximizing the propagation of one process by targeting the most "influential" nodes in the network. The majority of prior work however, focuses on unsigned networks where individuals adopt the opinion of their neighbors with certain probability. In real life, relationships between individuals can be positive (e.g., friend of relationship) or negative (e.g. connection between "foes"). According to social theory, people tend to have similar opinions to their friends but opposite of their foes. In this work, we study the problem of competing cascades on signed networks, which has been relatively unexplored. Particularly, we study the progressive propagation of two competing cascades in a signed network under the Independent Cascade Model, and provide an approximate analytical solution to compute the probability of infection of a node at any given time. We leverage our analytical solution to the problem of competing cascades in signed networks to develop a heuristic for the influence maximization problem. Unlike prior work, we allow the seed-set to be initialized with populations of both cascades with the end goal of maximizing the spread of one cascade. We validate our approach on several large-scale real-world and synthetic networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our influence maximization heuristic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly when the network is dominated by distrust relationships.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of selecting users in an online social network for targeted advertising so as to maximize the adoption of a given product. In previous work, two families of models have been considered to address this problem: direct targeting and network-based targeting. The former approach targets users with the highest propensity to adopt the product, while the latter approach targets users with the highest influence potential -- that is users whose adoption is most likely to be followed by subsequent adoptions by peers. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines a notion of propensity and a notion of influence into a single utility function. We show that targeting a fixed number of high-utility users results in more adoptions than targeting either highly influential users or users with high propensity.},

abstract = {As the social networking websites arise, the social network has become an important vehicle for sharing information and exerting influences. For the widespread utilization of social influences, a lot of works such as influence maximization and innovation promotion have been studied on various diffusion models. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works has incorporated the interplay between the intensity of interest and influence strength, which has been widely observed in social sciences, into the diffusion model. To fulfill this gap, in this paper, we propose the ID model that is able to capture the dynamic influence strength owing to the interplay. Under this ID model, we address the novel utilization of dynamic influence strength for personalized promotion to grow the intensity of a target individual's interest in an issue. In particular, to have the cost of promotion minimized, we introduce a novel Algorithm ISES to search for the least number of individuals as seeds in the promotion strategy. The ISES algorithm is able to identify the cost-effective solution by adopting the backtracking search and employing pruning strategies. On the real dataset of DBLP, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ISES.},

abstract = {Identifying communities has always been a fundamental task in analysis of complex networks. Many methods have been devised over the last decade for detection of communities. Amongst them, the label propagation algorithm brings great scalability together with high accuracy. However, it has one major flaw; when the community structure in the network is not clear enough, it will assign every node the same label, thus detecting the whole graph as one giant community. We have addressed this issue by setting a capacity for communities, starting from a small value and gradually increasing it over time. Preliminary results show that not only our extension improves the detection capability of the classic label propagation algorithm when communities are not clearly detectable, but also improves the overall quality of the identified clusters in complex networks with a clear community structure.},

abstract = {A key problem for facilitators of online communication and social networks is to identify users whose activity is likely to change in the near future. Such predictions may serve as basis for targeted campaigns aimed at sustaining or increasing overall user engagement in the network. A common approach to this problem is to apply machine learning methods to make predictions at the level of individuals. These approaches consider only information about each individual user and, thus, do not exploit the social connections and structure of the network. In this paper, we approach the problem of activity change prediction at the level of communities rather than individuals. We develop predictive models of activity change over communities obtained using state-of-art community detection methods and compare their predictive power with each other and against the single-user baseline and ego networks. The results show that community-level prediction models achieve higher prediction accuracy than the traditional single-user approach, whereas a local community detection algorithm outperforms a global modularity-based method.},

abstract = {We propose a flow propagation algorithm (FlowPro) that finds the community surrounding a node in a complex network. In each iteration of the main process of FlowPro, the initial node propagates a flow that is shared among its neighbors. Each node is able to store, propagate to its neighbors, and return, part of the flow it receives to the initial node. When the algorithm converges, the flow stored in the nodes that belong to the community of the initial node, is generally higher than the flow stored in the rest of the graph nodes, thus the requested community emerges. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that FlowPro is local, allows to visualize the community and does not require the knowledge of the entire graph as most of the existing methods found in the literature. This makes possible the application of FlowPro in extremely large graphs or in cases where the entire graph is unknown like in most social networks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called CS-ComDet, to efficiently detect the inter-community links based on a newly emerged paradigm in sparse signal recovery, called compressive sensing. We test our method on real-world networks of various kinds whose community structures are already known, and illustrate that the proposed method detects the inter-community links accurately even with low number of measurements (i.e. when the number of measurements is less than half of the number of existing links in the network).},

abstract = {Sentiment classification has become a ubiquitous enabling technology in the Twittersphere, since classifying tweets according to the sentiment they convey towards a given entity (be it a product, a person, a political party, or a policy) has many applications in political science, social science, market research, and many others. In this paper we contend that most previous studies dealing with tweet sentiment classification (TSC) use a suboptimal approach. The reason is that the final goal of most such studies is not estimating the class label (e.g., Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of individual tweets, but estimating the relative frequency (a.k.a. "prevalence") of the different classes in the dataset. The latter task is called quantification, and recent research has convincingly shown that it should be tackled as a task of its own, using learning algorithms and evaluation measures different from those used for classification. In this paper we show, on a multiplicity of TSC datasets, that using a quantification-specific algorithm produces substantially better class frequency estimates than a state-of-the-art classification-oriented algorithm routinely used in TSC. We thus argue that researchers interested in tweet sentiment prevalence should switch to quantification-specific (instead of classification-specific) learning algorithms and evaluation measures.},

abstract = {The rise in the use of social networks in the recent years has resulted in an abundance of information on different aspects of everyday social activities that is available online, with the most prominent and timely source of such information being Twitter. This has resulted in a proliferation of tools and applications that can help end-users and large-scale event organizers to better plan and manage their activities. In this process of analysis of the information originating from social networks, an important aspect is that of the geographic coordinates, i.e., geolocalisation, of the relevant information, which is necessary for several applications (e.g., on trending venues, traffic jams, etc.). Unfortunately, only a very small percentage of the twitter posts are geotagged, which significantly restricts the applicability and utility of such applications. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a framework for geolocating tweets that are not geotagged. Our solution is general, and estimates the location from which a post was generated by exploiting the similarities in the content between this post and a set of geotagged tweets, as well as their time-evolution characteristics. Contrary to previous approaches, our framework aims at providing accurate geolocation estimates at fine grain (i.e., within a city). The experimental evaluation with real data demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.},

This paper analyzes the structural properties of this network, and compares it with a Twitter user network. The topological properties we studied include the degree distributions, reciprocity, clustering coefficient, PageRank centrality, and degree assortativity. We find that Weibo users have a higher diversity index, higher Gini index, but a lower reciprocity and clustering coefficient for most of the nodes. A surprising observation is that the reciprocity of Weibo is only about a quarter of the reciprocity of the Twitter user network. We also show that Weibo adoption rate correlates with economic development positively, and Weibo network can be used to quantify the connections between provinces and regions in China. In particular, point-wise mutual information is shown to be accurate in quantifying the strength of connections.},

One option for scaffolding collaboration in CQA systems is a recommendation of new questions to users who are suitable candidates for providing correct answers (so called question routing). Various methods have been proposed so far to find appropriate answerers, but almost all approaches heavily depend on previous users' activities in a particular CQA system (i.e. QA-data). In our work, we attempt to involve a whole community including users with no or minimal previous activity (e.g. newcomers or lurkers). We proposed a question routing method which analyses users' non-QA data from a CQA system itself as well as from external services and platforms, such as blogs, microblogs or social networking sites, in order to estimate users' interests and expertise early and more precisely. Consequently, we can recommend new questions to a wider part of a community as well as more accurately. Evaluation on a dataset from Stack Exchange platform showed that considering non-QA data leads not only to better recognition of users with low activity as suitable answerers, but also to higher overall precision of the recommendations. It implies that non-QA data can supplement QA data during expertise estimation in question routing and thus also improve a success rate of a questions answering process.},

abstract = {It is well known that many social networks follow the homophily principle, dictating that individuals tend to connect with similar peers. Past studies focused on non-topological properties, such as the age, gender, beliefs or educations. In this paper we focus precisely on the topology itself, exploring the possible existence of pairwise role dependency, that is, purely structural homophily. We show that while pairwise dependency is necessary for some structural roles, it may be misleading for others. We also present SR-Diffuse, a novel method for identifying the structural roles of nodes within a network. It is an iterative algorithm following an optimization model able to learn simultaneously from topological features and structural homophily, combining both aspects. For assessing our method, we applied it in a classification problem in information cascades, comparing its performance against several baseline methods. The experimental results with Flickr and Digg data show that SR-Diffuse can improve the quality of the discovered roles and can better represent the profile of the individuals, leading to a better prediction of social classes within information cascades.},

abstract = {Large cities today are facing major challenges in planning and policy formulation to keep their growth sustainable. In this paper, we aim to gain useful insights about people living in a city by developing novel models to mine user lifestyles represented by the users' activity centers. Two models, namely ACMM and ACHMM, have been developed to learn the activity centers of each user using a large dataset of bus and subway train trips performed by passengers in Singapore. We show that ACHMM and ACMM yield similar accuracies in location prediction task. We also propose methods to automatically predict "home", "work" and "others" labels of locations visited by each user. Through validating with human-labeled home and work locations, we show that the accuracy of location label assignment is surprisingly very good even using an unsupervised method. With the location labels assigned, we further derive interesting insights of urban lifestyles at both individual and population levels.},

abstract = {To help users better understand the potential risks associated with publishing data publicly, as well as the quantity and sensitivity of information that can be obtained by combining data from various online sources, we introduce a novel information exposure detection framework that generates and analyzes the web footprints users leave across the social web. Web footprints are the traces of one's online social activities represented by a set of attributes that are known or can be inferred with a high probability by an adversary who has basic information about a user from his/her public profiles. Our framework employs new probabilistic operators, novel pattern-based attribute extraction from text, and a population-based inference engine to generate web footprints. Using a web footprint, the framework then quantifies a user's level of information exposure relative to others with similar traits, as well as with regard to others in the population. Evaluation over public profiles from multiple sites (Google+, LinkeIn, FourSquare, and Twitter) shows that the proposed framework effectively detects and quantifies information exposure using a small amount of initial knowledge.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the influence of social status on opinion dynamics and consensus building in collaboration networks. To that end, we simulate the diffusion of opinions in empirical collaboration networks by taking into account both the network structure and the individual differences of people reflected through their social status. For our simulations, we adapt a well-known Naming Game model and extend it with the Probabilistic Meeting Rule to account for the social status of individuals participating in a meeting. This mechanism is sufficiently flexible and allows us to model various situations in collaboration networks, such as the emergence or disappearance of social classes. In this work, we concentrate on studying three well-known forms of class society: egalitarian, ranked and stratified. In particular, we are interested in the way these society forms facilitate opinion diffusion. Our experimental findings reveal that (i) opinion dynamics in collaboration networks is indeed affected by the individuals' social status and (ii) this effect is intricate and non-obvious. In particular, although the social status favors consensus building, relying on it too strongly can slow down the opinion diffusion, indicating that there is a specific setting for each collaboration network in which social status optimally benefits the consensus building process.},

abstract = {Since the tremendous success of social networking websites, the related analytical research has been widely studied. Among these studies, social influence has been a significant and popular topic. We rely on the social influence model to predict and learn the influence diffusion process. However, traditional models only categorize nodes into two types of states, active and inactive. In addition, most previous models have only taken positive influences into account. Moreover, if inactive nodes are influenced successfully and turn into active nodes, these nodes cannot change their states forever. In this work, we not only break the above limitations but also propose a novel propagation method in our model. We proposes five states to represent the multiple states of influence. According to the new propagation method, the strength of the social influence may be reduced over time. Eventually, we utilize the measurement of precisions to compare with related models. The proposed multi-state model outperforms other two-state models in precisions of prediction. The experimental results show the superiority of multiple states.},

abstract = {Probabilistic cascade models consider information diffusion as an iterative process in which information transits from users to others in a network. The problem of diffusion modeling then comes down to learning transmission probability distributions, depending on hidden influence relationships between users, in order to discover the main diffusion channels of the network. Various learning models have been proposed in the literature, but we argue that the diffusion mechanisms defined in most of these models are too complex for real social networks, where transmissions of content occur between human users. Classical models usually have some difficulties for extracting the main regularities in such real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a relaxed learning process of the well-known Independent Cascade model that, rather than attempting to explain exact timestamps of users' infections, focus on infection probabilities knowing sets of previously infected users. Experiments show the effectiveness of our proposals, by considering the learned models for real-world prediction tasks.},

abstract = {The goal of a rumor source node in a social network is to spread its rumor to as many nodes as possible, while remaining hidden from the network administrator. On the other hand, the network administrator aims to identify the source node based on knowledge of which nodes have accepted the rumor (which are called infected nodes). We model the rumor spreading and source identification problem as a strategic game, where the rumor source and the network administrator are the two players. As the Jordan center estimator is a minimax source estimator that has been shown to be robust in recent works, we assume that the network administrator utilizes a source estimation strategy that probes every node within a given radius of the Jordan center. Given any estimation strategy, we design a best-response infection strategy for the rumor source. Given any infection strategy, we design a best-response estimation strategy for the network administrator. We derive conditions under which the Nash equilibria of the strategic game exist. Simulations in both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed infection strategy infects more nodes while maintaining the same safety margin between the true source node and the Jordan center source estimator.},

abstract = {Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) integrate location-based facilities with social connectivity for delivering a variety of services, enhancing user experience, emergency/disaster management, and streamlining business processes. A number of recent research efforts have studied relationships between geolocation and social connectivity, social connectivity and preferences, and node attributes and strength of social ties. These efforts have successfully demonstrated prediction of various attributes based on social connectivity, mobility, dynamic checkin information etc., including prediction of user location as well as future checkin locations.In this paper, we study the relationship between shared checkin locations and the structure and nature of social ties. We argue that typical LSBNs are in fact composed of layers of networks of varying structure and function, and that it is possible to deconcolve these networks through effective statistical analysis of shared checkins. In this context, we pose and validate the following hypotheses: (i) a large number of shared checkins imply social connectivity; however, social connectivity does not imply statistically large number of shared checkins; (ii) entities in social ties that share a large number of checkins tend to be strongly clustered. We hypothesize that such strong ties (for example, family ties, friendships etc.) carry higher influence compared to weaker ties (mere acquaintances) in the social network; and (iii) social ties that have statistically fewer shared checkins (weak ties) tend to be less clustered than the underlying (baseline) network. We hypothesize that such ties (for example professional ties, friends of friends, acquaintances etc.,) carry less influence. We present statistical models and validate our hypotheses on real datasets. Our conclusions can significantly enhance flow of information and influence in the network by suitably leveraging the distinct relationships captured in the deconcolved networks.},

Moreover, properly defined centrality measures reveal the distribution of power and, therefore, important individuals in the network. We develop this idea and propose a model that is consistent with management theory, and that captures main traits of large corporations. The carcass of the model is an organisational hierarchy. We extend it by allowing additional types of connections such as collaboration, consultation, and friendship. Having both reporting and non-reporting interpersonal ties, our model supports a multilevel approach to social networks. We then formally define power and stability in organisations. These notions enable us to analyse a range of organisational phenomena such as limited hierarchy height, restructuring through flattening, and impact of non-reporting ties. We support our framework with examples and case studies.},

In this paper, we propose to detect these important and reliable links - significant edges, from a target network by using multiple auxiliary networks and a limited amount of labelled information. In this process, we first abstract the community knowledge learnt across target and auxiliary networks to detect significant patterns. The mined community knowledge captures the key profile of network relationships and thus can be used to determine whether an existing edge indicates a true or false relationship. Experiments on real world network data show that our two staged solution -- a joint matrix factorisation procedure followed by edge significance score ranking, accurately predicts significant edges in target network by jointly exploring the underlying knowledge embedded in both target and auxiliary networks.},

These, often geo-tagged, data can be used to provide valuable information to closely located users, both in real time and in aggregated form. However, despite the fact that users publish geo-tagged information, only a small number implicitly reports their base location in their Online Social Network profile. In this paper we present a simple yet effective methodology for identifying a user's key locations, namely her home and work places. We evaluate our methodology with Twitter datasets collected from the country of Netherlands, city of London and Los Angeles county. Furthermore, we combine Twitter and LinkedIn information to construct a work location dataset and evaluate our methodology. Results show that our proposed methodology not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 30% in terms of accuracy, but also cuts the detection radius at least at half the distance from other methods.},

abstract = {Crowds offer a new form of efficacious collective decision making, yet knowledge about the mechanisms by which they achieve superior outcomes remains nascent. It has been suggested that crowds work best with market-like relationships when individuals make independent decisions and possess dissimilar information. By contrast, sociological discussions of markets argue that risky decisions are mitigated by network relations that embed economic transactions in social ties that promote trustworthiness and reciprocity. To investigate the role of networks within crowds and their performance effects, we examined the complete record of financial lending decisions on Prosper.com, 1/2006-3/2012, the first U.S. crowdfunding platform and a chief gateway to capital for entrepreneurs and general borrowers that continues to disrupt conventional financial lending structures infusing more than $5.1 billion into the market in 2013. Our study reveals how reciprocity, recurring borrower-lender dyads, and persistent co-lending underpin the dynamics of network lending. Further, we show how network ties influence the evolution of the lending behavior. We find that in the early stage of fundraising, network relations provide larger proportions of loans, typically lending four times more per bid than strangers. They also respond to loan requests on average 59.5% sooner than strangers. The size of the first loan and the time to lending also tend to prompt lending by strangers, suggesting that network relations might move the market, a finding that persists even as fewer lenders dominate more of the market for loans on Prosper. Finally, network relations are associated with greater engagement: when the first loan is underwritten by a friend, 50% of the remaining loans come from friends as well.},

abstract = {Online dating sites have become popular platforms for people to look for potential romantic partners. Different from traditional user-item recommendations where the goal is to match items (e.g., books, videos, etc) with a user's interests, a recommendation system for online dating aims to match people who are mutually interested in and likely to communicate with each other. We introduce similarity measures that capture the unique features and characteristics of the online dating network, for example, the interest similarity between two users if they send messages to same users, and attractiveness similarity if they receive messages from same users. A reciprocal score that measures the compatibility between a user and each potential dating candidate is computed and the recommendation list is generated to include users with top scores. The performance of our proposed recommendation system is evaluated on a real-world dataset from a major online dating site in China. The results show that our recommendation algorithms significantly outperform previously proposed approaches, and the collaborative filtering-based algorithms achieve much better performance than content-based algorithms in both precision and recall. Our results also reveal interesting behavioral difference between male and female users when it comes to looking for potential dates. In particular, males tend to be focused on their own interest and oblivious towards their attractiveness to potential dates, while females are more conscientious to their own attractiveness to the other side of the line.},

We perform the analysis on data that we collected daily from 160,000 apps, over a period of six months in 2012. We report often surprising results. For instance, at most 50% of the apps are updated in all categories, which significantly impacts the median price. The average price does not exhibit seasonal monthly trends and a changing price does not show any observable correlation with the download count. In addition, productive developers are not creating many popular apps, but a few developers control apps which dominate the total number of downloads. We discuss the research implications of such analytics on improving developer and user experiences, and detecting emerging threat vectors.},

The study of the resilience of supply networks is an important challenge. In this paper, we exploit the resilience embedded in the network topology by investigating in depth the multiple-path reachability of each demand node to other nodes, and propose a novel network resilience metric. We also develop new supply-network growth mechanisms that reflect the heterogeneous roles of different types of nodes in the supply network. We incorporate them into two fundamental network topologies (i.e. random-graph network and scale-free network), and evaluate their resilience against both random disruptions and targeted attacks using the new resilience metric. The experimental results verify the validity of our resilience metric and the effectiveness of our growth model. This research provides a generic framework and important insights into the construction and resilience analysis of complex supply networks.},

abstract = {Detecting and forecasting civil unrest events (protests, strikes, etc.) is of key interest to social scientists and policy makers because these events can lead to significant societal and cultural changes. We analyze protest dynamics in six countries of Latin America on a daily level, from November 2012 through August 2014, using multiple data sources that capture social, political and economic contexts within which civil unrest occurs. We use logistic regression models with Lasso to select a sparse feature set from our diverse datasets, in order to predict the probability of occurrence of civil unrest events in these countries. The models contain predictors extracted from social media sites (Twitter and blogs) and news sources, in addition to volume of requests to Tor, a widely-used anonymity network. Two political event databases and country-specific exchange rates are also used. Our forecasting models are evaluated using a Gold Standard Report (GSR), which is compiled by an independent group of social scientists and experts on Latin America. The experimental results, measured by F1-scores, are in the range 0.68 to 0.95, and demonstrate the efficacy of using a multi-source approach for predicting civil unrest. Case studies illustrate the insights into unrest events that are obtained with our methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study an important issue whether the network properties on mobile social networks are still similar to these on traditional web-based social networks. To explore such answers is important since the paradigm shift has already happened from PC-based access to mobile access nowadays. In this paper, we focus on Instagram, which is a remarkable mobile-based photo sharing platform, as the reference network. We comprehensively study its network properties in the quantitative sense, and reveal some interesting results. Surprisingly, some properties in Instagram are highly diverse from these characteristics in traditional social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. We thus state that traditional assumptions on the network properties should be re-verified when developers devise social applications, such as the advertisement strategies, for mobile networks. We also conclude that the new research spectrum is highly demanded on network analysis and social technologies for the next-generation mobile-based social platform.},

abstract = {Contemporary modern world has witnessed the widespread emergence of online social media and similar technologies. Peoples' behaviour over different social network platform has become an interesting topic of research. In this study, we investigate whether people express analogous identity over different platforms and analysis of different social platform usage contributes to reveal more of a person. We analyse people's usage pattern in two major online platforms, the most widely used social media platform Twitter and a major online commenting platform Disqus. We extract linguistic features and infer personality traits from both of these platforms. Our study reveals differential relationship between personality traits and Disqus and Twitter usage. We also find that social media has an influence on a person's discussion topic. People share opinion on varieties of topics and entities exclusively in Twitter and Disqus. Moreover Disqus provides stronger assessment of a person's sentiment over a topic or entity. Combination of these two profiles gives an extensive view of a user's interest and sensitivity which justify the inference that people use different social network for different purposes and single social network analysis is not enough to build a comprehensive virtual identity of a person.},

abstract = {Networks of online news articles and blog posts are some of the most commonly used data sets in network science. As a result, they have become a vital piece of network analysis and are used for the evaluation of algorithms that work on large networks, or serve as examples in the analysis of information diffusion and propagation. Similarly, scientific citation networks are part of the bedrock upon which much of modern network analysis is built and have been studied for decades. In this paper, we show that the backbone inherent to networks of online news articles shares significant structural similarities to scientific citation networks once the noise of spurious links is stripped away. We present a data set of news articles that, while it is extremely sparse and lightweight, still contains information relevant to the propagation of information in mass media and is remarkably similar to scientific citation networks, thus opening the door to the use of established methodologies from scientometrics and bibliometrics in the analysis of online news propagation.},

In this paper, we present a study on both detecting cyberbullies in online social networks and identifying the pairwise interactions between users through which the influence of bullies seems to spread. In particular, we investigate the role of user demographics and social network features in predicting how users will respond to a cyberbullying comment. We characterize the influencer/influenced relationship by which a user who has no history of abuse observes a peer engaging in bullying and follows suit. To our knowledge, this is the first effort modeling peer pressure and social dynamics with analytical models. We validate our models on two distinct social network datasets, totalling over 16,000 posts. Our results offer insight into the dynamics of bullying and confirm social theories on the power of peer groups in the cyberworld. A full version of this paper is available on arXiv.org.},

abstract = {The phenomenal success of certain crowdsourced online platforms, such as Wikipedia, is accredited to their ability to tap the crowd's potential to collaboratively build knowledge. While it is well known that the crowd's collective wisdom surpasses the cumulative individual expertise, little is understood on the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced environment. A proper understanding of the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced environment would enable one in the better designing of such environments to solicit knowledge from the crowd. Our experiment on crowdsourced systems based on annotations shows that an important reason for the rapid knowledge building in such environments is due to variance in expertise. We use, as our test bed, a customized Crowdsourced Annotation System (CAS) which provides a group of users the facility to annotate a given document while trying to understand it. Our results show the presence of different genres of proficiency amongst the users of an annotation system. We observe that the crowdsourced knowledge ecosystem comprises of mainly four categories of contributors, namely: Probers, Solvers, Articulators and Explorers. We infer from our experiment that the knowledge garnering mainly happens due to the synergetic interaction across these categories.},

abstract = {We study the relationship between the level of chatter on a social medium (like Twitter) and the level of the observed actions related to the chatter. For example, in a disaster, how does relief-donation chatter on Twitter correlate with the dollar amount received? One hypothesis is that a fraction of those who act will also tweet about it, which implies linear scaling, action ∝ chatter. On the other hand, if there is a contagion effect (those who tweet about donation incite others to donate) and these incited donors tend to be "quiet" and not broadcast their actions, then we expect superlinear scaling,action ∝ chatterγwhere γ &gt; 1. We show, using a simple model, that the degree sequence of the social media "follower" network plays a key role in determining the scaling exponent γ. For random graphs and power-law graphs, the scaling exponent is at or near 2 (quadratic amplification). We empirically validate the model's predictions using location-paired donation and social media data from U.S. states after Hurricane Sandy. Understanding the scaling behavior that relates social-media chatter to real physical actions is an important step for estimating the extent of a response and for determining social-media strategies to affect the response.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the network completion problem, where it is assumed that only a small sample of a network (e.g., a complete or partially observed subgraph of a social graph) is observed and we would like to infer the unobserved part of the network. In this paper, we assume that besides the observed subgraph, side information about the nodes such as the pairwise similarity between them is also provided. In contrast to the original network completion problem where the standard methods such as matrix completion is inapplicable due the non-uniform sampling of observed links, we show that by effectively exploiting the side information, it is possible to accurately predict the unobserved links. In contrast to existing matrix completion methods with side information such as shared subsapce learning and matrix completion with transduction, the proposed algorithm decouples the completion from transduction to effectively exploit the similarity information. This crucial difference greatly boosts the performance when appropriate similarity information is used. The recovery error of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed based on the richness of the similarity information and the size of the observed submatrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the network completion with similarity of nodes with provable guarantees. Experiments on synthetic and real networks from Facebook and Google+ show that the proposed two-stage method is able to accurately reconstruct the network and outperforms other methods.},

abstract = {Real-world network data is often very noisy and contains erroneous or missing edges. These superfluous and missing edges can be identified statistically by assessing the number of common neighbors of the two incident nodes. To evaluate whether this number of common neighbors, the so called co-occurrence, is statistically significant, a comparison with the expected co-occurrence in a suitable random graph model is required. For networks with a skewed degree distribution, including most real-world networks, it is known that the fixed degree sequence model, which maintains the degrees of nodes, is favourable over using simplified graph models that are based on an independence assumption. However, the use of a fixed degree sequence model requires sampling from the space of all graphs with the given degree sequence and measuring the co-occurrence of each pair of nodes in each of the samples, since there is no known closed formula for this statistic. While there exist log-linear approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, the computational complexity still depends on the length of the Markov chain and the number of samples, which is significant in large-scale networks. In this article, we show based on ground truth data that there are various phase transition-like tipping points that enable us to choose a comparatively low number of samples and to reduce the length of the Markov chains without reducing the quality of the significance test. As a result, the computational effort can be reduced by an order of magnitudes.},

abstract = {Lurkers are silent members of a social network (SN) who gain benefit from others' information without significantly giving back to the community. The study of lurking behaviors in SNs is nonetheless important, since these users acquire knowledge from the community, and as such they are social capital holders. Within this view, a major goal is to delurk such users, i.e., to encourage them to more actively be involved in the SN. Despite delurking strategies have been conceptualized in social science and human-computer interaction research, no computational approach has been so far defined to turn lurkers into active participants in the SN. In this work we fill this gap by presenting a delurking-oriented targeted influence maximization problem under the linear threshold (LT) model. We define a novel objective function, in terms of the lurking scores associated with the nodes in the final active set, and we show it is monotone and submodular. We provide an approximate solution by developing a greedy algorithm, named DEvOTION, which computes a k- node set that maximizes the value of the delurking-capital-based objective function, for a given minimum lurking score threshold. Results on SN datasets of different sizes have demonstrated the significance of our delurking approach via LT-based targeted influence maximization.},

abstract = {Roles and positions are structural components in complex social systems which group actors based on how similarly they are connected to the rest of the actors. Role and position detection methods have been successfully used to evaluate and understand the dynamics of social networks and the behavior of their members. However, actor similarities used to detect positions have been based on pairwise comparisons so far: e.g., structural equivalence states that Alice and Bob are in the same position if they are both connected or not to the same other actors in the network, one by one. In this work we present a new framework to find positions and roles using comparisons between actors and sets of actors instead of just using pairwise comparisons. In this way we enable the usage of many more measures of similarity inside position and role detection methods, e.g., based on distances, community structure, triangles and cliques. As a result, we can identify new types of easily interpretable positions. Additionally, the proposed idea can be adapted to more complex models like hypergraphs or multiplex/multi-relational networks. We have evaluated our work on both synthetic and real data, using several existing and new similarity measures and providing both qualitative and quantitative evidence of the new possibilities enabled by our approach.},

abstract = {Physical events in the real world are known to trigger reactions and then discussions in online social media. Mining these reactions through online social sensors offers a fast and low cost way to understand what is happening in the physical world. In some cases, however, further study of the affected population's emotional state can improve this understanding. In our study we analyzed how car commuters react on Twitter while stuck in heavy traffic. We discovered that the online social footprint does not necessarily follow a strict linear correlation with the volume of a traffic jam. Through our analysis we offer a potential explanation: people's mood could be an additional factor, apart from traffic severity itself, that leads in fluctuations of the observed reaction in social media. This finding can be important for social sensing applications where external factors, like sentiment, also contribute on how humans react.We propose a novel traffic-congestion estimation model that utilizes the volume of messages and complaints in online social media, based on when they happen. We show through experimental evaluation that the proposed model can estimate, with higher accuracy, traffic jam severity and compare the results with several baselines. The model achieves at least 38% improvement of absolute error and more than 45% improvement of relative error, when compared with a baseline that assumes linear correlation between traffic and social volume. To support our findings we combined data from the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) and Twitter, for a total of 6 months, and focused on a major traffic-heavy freeway in Los Angeles, California.},

abstract = {We present and test a scalable approach for assigning valence to links in unsigned graphs with the ultimate goal of enabling triadic balanced assessment in communication networks. We do this by applying domain-adjusted sentiment analysis to the content of communication data and translating aggregated sentiment scores for information exchanged between network members into link signs. This approach facilitates fast, informed and systematic balance testing (we generate link signs for 166,670 triads in our data); allowing for empirical hypothesis testing and theory building based on current or archival communication data. The proposed technique eliminates the need for manually labeling text data, and overcomes limitations with inferring valence from self-reported or user-generated (meta-) data in situations where historical context and ground truth valence data might be unavailable or limited. We test this approach on corporate email data to complement the large amount of prior work based on social media data and the limited knowledge on sentiment in professional settings. Our results suggest that sentiment is overall slightly positive and emotionality is low, which reflects conventions of language use in a corporate environment. We observe that people draw from (the top of) a smaller pool of positive terms more frequently than from a larger set of negative terms. The ratio of balanced triads (on average about 88%) to unbalanced triads (12%) remains relatively stable despite changes in corporate performance. The labor-intense adjustment of a given lexical resource to some dataset and domain pays off as it generates more empirical evidence with lower variance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop Targeted Dot Product Representation (TarDPR), a DPR-based feature selection and combination framework for friend recommendation in online social networks (OSNs). Our approach modifies conventional DPR techniques and makes itself applicable to OSNs by focusing on computing a consistent representation while minimizing unnecessary suggestions made outside these interested regions. A notable property of TarDPR is its ability to effectively incorporate different types of social features and produce new meaningful features that help competitive approaches to significantly improve their recommendation quality. We derive an iterative algorithm for TarDPR that is supported by mathematical analysis, and is efficient on large social traces. To certify the usability of our approach, we conduct empirical experiments on real social traces including Facebook and Foursquare social networks. The competitive experimental results show that TarDPR achieves up to 15% improvement in comparison with other competitive methods. These results consequently confirm the efficacy of our suggested framework.},

abstract = {Advertising activity on SNS has grown rapidly and is now a billion dollar business. In the SNS advertising model, the SNS serves as the advertising agent, and takes the advantage of network diffusion to attract advertisers and charges for the cascading impressions. The optimal ad allocation task is to choose the ad allocation plan that maximizes the revenue. Each user has different diffusion ability, limited daily impressions and the advertisers have various bidding prices and budget concerns. A feasible plan that obeys the constraints is difficult to find. The solution of this problem lies in the space of N |Ads|\texttimes{} |user|, which makes direct optimization unattractive. In this paper, we study SNS advertising business models, formulate the SNS ad allocation problem and show their connections with hyperbolic embedding. We develop a new embedding algorithm Hyper Cube Map that allows for dimension reduction. Our proposed method reduces the dimensionality of the original problem significantly, runs two to four orders of magnitude faster, and reaches 95% of the optimum.},

abstract = {How do people interact with their Facebook wall? At a high level, this question captures the essence of our work. While most prior efforts focus on Twitter, the much fewer Facebook studies focus on the friendship graph or are limited by the amount of users or the duration of the study. In this work, we model Facebook user behavior: we analyze the wall activities of users focusing on identifying common patterns and surprising phenomena. We conduct an extensive study of roughly 7K users over three years during four month intervals each year. We propose PowerWall, a lesser known heavy-tailed distribution to fit our data. Our key results can be summarized in the following points. First, we find that many wall activities, including number of posts, number of likes, number of posts of type photo, etc., can be described by the PowerWall distribution. What is more surprising is that most of these distributions have similar slope, with a value close to 1! Second, we show how our patterns and metrics can help us spot surprising behaviors and anomalies. For example, we find a user posting every two days, exactly the same count of posts; another user posting at midnight, with no other activity before or after. Our work provides a solid step towards a systematic and quantitative wall-centric profiling of Facebook user activity.},

abstract = {Online social networks are a popular and important channel for people to share, find and disseminate information on a massive scale. Some of the information exposed through these networks is meant to be private. However, sensitive organizational information can be accidentally leaked by employees and become exposed to adversaries or competitors. The threat is escalated due to socialbots used by adversaries to penetrate the informal social network of an organization's employees in order to harvest sensitive information. This study evaluates the ability of an attacker to harvest leaked information using socialbots versus the effort required to wire the profiles into the organizational network. The evaluation is performed using real information diffusion data of two social networks and extensive simulations of socialbot wiring strategies. Our results demonstrate that organizations whose social network topologies are characterized by low clustering coefficient are more vulnerable to eavesdropping. We also show that the most effective socialbot wiring strategy for harvesting information is different from the most effective strategies for infiltrating the organization.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks exploit a lightweight process to identify their users so as to facilitate their fast adoption. However, such convenience comes at the price of making legitimate users subject to different threats created by fake accounts. Therefore, there is a crucial need to empower users with tools helping them in assigning a level of trust to whomever they interact with. To cope with this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel model, DIVa, that leverages on mining techniques to find correlations among user profile attributes. These correlations are discovered not from user population as a whole, but from individual communities, where the correlations are more pronounced. DIVa exploits a decentralized learning approach and ensures privacy preservation as each node in the OSN independently processes its local data and is required to know only its direct neighbors. Extensive experiments using real-world OSN datasets show that DIVa is able to extract fine-grained community-aware correlations among profile attributes with average improvements up to 50% than the global approach.},

This problem has been extensively investigated in single layer networks, that is, considering one network at a time. However, in multilayer networks, in which a holistic view of multiple networks is taken, the problem has not been specifically studied, and results for single layer networks are reused with no adaptation. In this work, we take an exhaustive and systematic approach to understand the effect of missing data in multilayer networks. Differently from the single layer networks, depending on layer interdependencies, the common network properties can increase or decrease with respect to the properties of the complete network. Another important aspect we observed through our experiments on real datasets is that multilayer network properties like layer correlation and relevance can be used to understand the impact of missing data compared to measuring traditional network measures.},

abstract = {This research utilizes social network analysis to determine the success of three different disruption strategies on a child exploitation network extracted from the public internet. Using a custom-written web-crawler called LECEN, data from a set of hyperlinked child-exploitation websites was collected from the Internet. From these data, two types of networks were coded: the nodes of the first network consisted of only website domains, while the nodes of the second were generated using the registrant data, where the nodes represented the legal owners of those same domains. Three attack scenarios were carried out on these two networks: two types of hub attacks (one focused on in-degree and one focused on out-degree) and a bridge attack. Using these disruption strategies, it was found that bridge attacks were more suitable for disrupting the domain networks, while both hub-attacks could be favored when disrupting the network of registrants. These findings have implications for law enforcement, as it provides real-world applications to disruption where registrants may be targeted directly.},

abstract = {Small Group evolution has been of central importance in social sciences and also in the industry for understanding dynamics of team formation. While most of research works studying groups deal at a macro level with evolution of arbitrary size communities, in this paper we restrict ourselves to studying evolution of small group (size ≤ 20) which is governed by contrasting sociological phenomenon. Given a previous history of group collaboration between a set of actors, we address the problem of predicting likely future group collaborations. Unfortunately, predicting groups requires choosing from (n r) possibilities (where r is group size and n is total number of actors), which becomes computationally intractable as group size increases. However, our statistical analysis of a real world dataset has shown that two processes: an external actor joining an existing group (incremental accretion (IA)) or collaborating with a subset of actors of an exiting group (subgroup accretion (SA)), are largely responsible for future group formation. This helps to drastically reduce the (n r) possibilities. We therefore, model the attachment of a group for different actors outside this group. In this paper, we have built three topology based prediction models to study these phenomena. The performance of these models is evaluated using extensive experiments over DBLP dataset. Our prediction results shows that the proposed models are significantly useful for future group predictions both for IA and SA.},

abstract = {Interactions in dynamic networks often transcend the dyadic barrier and emerge as subgraphs. The evolution of these subgraphs cannot be completely predicted using a pairwise link prediction analysis. We propose a novel solution to the problem---"Prediction of Recurrent Subgraphs (PReSub)" which treats subgraphs as individual entities in their own right. PReSub predicts re-occurring subgraphs using the network's vector space embedding and a set of "early warning subgraphs" which act as global and local descriptors of the subgraph's behavior. PReSub can be used as an out-of-the-box pipeline method with user-provided subgraphs or even to discover interesting subgraphs in an unsupervised manner. It can handle missing network information and is parallelizable. We show that PReSub outperforms traditional pairwise link prediction for a variety of evolving network datasets. The goal of this framework is to improve our understanding of subgraphs and provide an alternative representation in order to characterize their behavior.},

The user diversity, dynamic behaviors, and hidden social influences make the problem more challenging. In this work, we propose a deep learning model named Social Restricted Boltzmann Machine (SRBM) for human behavior modeling and prediction in health social networks. In the proposed SRBM model, we naturally incorporate self-motivation, implicit and explicit social influences, and environmental events together into three layers which are historical, visible, and hidden layers. The interactions among these behavior determinants are naturally simulated through parameters connecting these layers together. The contrastive divergence and back-propagation algorithms are employed for training the model. A comprehensive experiment on real and synthetic data has shown the great effectiveness of our deep learning model compared with conventional methods.},

It is therefore natural to model many kinds of social networks by directed graphs, with a node corresponding to each participant, and a weighted directed edge to each relationship. Spectral embeddings for directed graphs are known, but they have significant weaknesses. We design a new directed-graph embedding, show that its mathematical properties are appropriate, and demonstrate its application to some synthetic and real-world networks. As well as avoiding the weaknesses of known techniques, the new embedding also represents a property we call flow betweenness of each node, allowing for directed edge prediction.},

Motivated by the need for low-latency distance queries in large-scale "dynamic" graphs, we consider the problem of answering exact shortest distance queries on disk-resident scale-free dynamic graphs. Our query processing uses the canonical labeling method, which is a special 2-hop distance labeling for fast distance queries. In this paper, we propose two I/O efficient algorithms to update the canonical labeling. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed methods are the first practical disk-based methods to "incrementally update" the canonical labeling on dynamic graphs. We also show how to answer distance queries on the latest network based on outdated labels and new edges. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our methods. Our update methods are an order of magnitude faster than reconstructing the canonical labeling. When the number of new edges is small, say less than 1% of the previous number of edges, our query algorithm based on outdated labels provides exact shortest distance and the query time is comparable to other query algorithms using latest labels.},

We contribute the first systematic conceptual and experimental comparison of edge sparsification methods on a diverse set of network properties. It is shown that they can be understood as methods for rating edges by importance and then filtering globally by these scores. In addition, we propose a new sparsification method (Local Degree) which preserves edges leading to local hub nodes. All methods are evaluated on a set of 100 Facebook social networks with respect to network properties including diameter, connected components, community structure, and multiple node centrality measures. Experiments with our implementations of the sparsification methods (using the open-source network analysis tool suite NetworKit) show that many network properties can be preserved down to about 20% of the original set of edges. Furthermore, the experimental results allow us to differentiate the behavior of different methods and show which method is suitable with respect to which property. Our Local Degree method is fast enough for large-scale networks and performs well across a wider range of properties than previously proposed methods.},

abstract = {Real-world networks often consist of multiple layers, be they infrastructure such as airline networks or social such as collaboration networks. A common aspect to these networks is that there are multiple sub-networks that evolve in parallel on the same node set -- these are referred to as multiplex networks. For example, in the case of airline networks, the cities (nodes) have been well-established for several decades if not centuries, but over time new airlines (sub-networks) emerge and each airline creates its own flight linkages between cities. Similarly multiple modalities of communications evolve in parallel between individuals (nodes) such as E-mail, SMS, and Online Social Networks, e.g., Facebook and Twitter. While in some multiplex networks, each layer evolves independently from other layers over time, in other multiple networks, the evolution of a layer is coupled with that of other layers -- a process referred to as co-evolution.In this paper, we propose a novel generative model, BINBALL, for a class of multiplex networks whose structure may co-evolve (that is, depend on as well as influence) the structure of the individual networks. We validate our model using a multiplex data set for the European Air Transportation Network (EATN). We also investigate questions regarding the algorithmic complexity of finding short paths through multiplex networks as well as coverage of nodes using a minimum number of layers. We show that while certain problems in this space can be solved in polynomial time, others are NP hard. Among the latter, some problems are approximable, whereas others are not. Finally, we demonstrate that BINBALL is a good generative model since it is able to generate random networks whose degree as well as path length distributions closely match those of the EATN.},

abstract = {Most traditional social networks rely on explicitly given relations between users, their friends and followers. In this paper, we go beyond well structured data repositories and create a person-centric network from unstructured text -- the Wikipedia Social Network. To identify persons in Wikipedia, we make use of interwiki links, Wikipedia categories and person related information available in Wikidata. From the co-occurrences of persons on a Wikipedia page we construct a large-scale person-centric network and provide a weighting scheme for the relationship of two persons based on the distances of their mentions within the text. We extract key characteristics of the network such as centrality, clustering coefficient and component sizes for which we find values that are typical for social networks. Using state-of-the-art algorithms for community detection in massive networks, we identify interesting communities and evaluate them against Wikipedia categories. The Wikipedia social network developed this way provides an important source for future social analysis tasks.},

abstract = {Collaboration is an integral element of the scientific process that often leads to findings with significant impact. While extensive efforts have been devoted to quantifying and predicting research impact, the question of how collaborative behavior influences scientific impact remains unaddressed. In this work, we study the interplay between scientists' collaboration signatures and their scientific impact. As the basis of our study, we employ an ArnetMiner dataset with more than 1.7 million authors and 2 million papers spanning over 60 years. We formally define a scientist's collaboration signature as the distribution of collaboration strengths with each collaborator in his or her academic ego network, which is quantified by four measures: sociability, dependence, diversity, and self-collaboration. We then demonstrate that the collaboration signature allows us to effectively distinguish between researchers with dissimilar levels of scientific impact. We also discover that, even from the early stages of one's researcher career, a scientist's collaboration signature can help to reveal his or her future scientific impact. Finally, we find that as a representative group of outstanding computer scientists, Turing Award winners collectively produce distinctive collaboration signatures throughout the entirety of their careers. Our conclusions on the relationship between collaboration signatures and scientific impact give rise to important implications for researchers who wish to expand their scientific impact and more effectively stand on the shoulders of "collaborators."},

abstract = {Is there a bias in paper selection processes for conferences? This work addresses one aspect of this question, and empirically examines if there is a bias in favor of the collaborators of the technical program committee members. Specifically, we check whether a paper written by a past collaborator of a program committee member is more likely to be accepted to the conference. If so, one might say that the program committee members were biased; if not, then they are fair. In order to answer the bias question, we studied 12 ACM/IEEE conferences over several years. For each annual meeting of a conference we constructed its social network, whose vertices are the program committee members and the authors of the papers accepted to the meeting. Two researchers are collaborators (neighbors in the network) if they have co-authored a paper before the meeting. In turn, for each meeting network, we calculated the coverage of the program committee in the network, which is the ratio between the number of authors that are collaborators of the program committee, and the total number of the authors-vertices of the meeting. We compared the coverage of the real meeting's social networks, to the coverage in artificially generated meetings (random and others). We view a program committee as coverage biased if its coverage is significantly higher than that of corresponding artificially generated meetings of the conference. Our findings show that, although there are some coverage biased program committees, in most meetings, the coverage in the real meetings is the same as, and sometimes less than, the artificially generated ones, indicating that on average there is probably no bias in favor of papers written by collaborators of the program committee members for these high quality conferences.},

abstract = {The unprecedented use of social media through smartphones and other web-enabled mobile devices has enabled the rapid adoption of platforms like Twitter. Event detection has found many applications on the web, including breaking news identification and summarization. The recent increase in the usage of Twitter during crises has attracted researchers to focus on detecting events in tweets. However, current solutions have focused on static Twitter data. The necessity to detect events in a streaming environment during fast paced events such as a crisis presents new opportunities and challenges. In this paper, we investigate event detection in the context of real-time Twitter streams as observed in real-world crises. We highlight the key challenges in this problem: the informal nature of text, and the high-volume and high-velocity characteristics of Twitter streams. We present a novel approach to address these challenges using single-pass clustering and the compression distance to efficiently detect events in Twitter streams. Through experiments on large Twitter datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to detect events in near real-time and can scale to large and noisy Twitter streams.},

abstract = {Microblogs such as Twitter are characterized by the richness and recency of information shared by their users during major events. However, it is very challenging to automatically mine for information or for users sharing certain information due to the huge variety of unstructured stream of data shared in such microblogs. This work proposes a ranking and classification model for identifying users sharing useful information during a specified event. The model is based on a novel set of features that can be computed in real time. These features are designed such that they take into account both the on and off-topic activities of a user. Once users are characterized by a feature vector, supervised machine learning tool is trained to classify users as either prominent or not. Our model has been tested on data shared during a flooding disaster event and performed very well. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed model for both the classification and ranking of prominent users in such events, and also the importance of the adjustment of the on-topic features by the off-topic ones when describing users' activities.},

abstract = {Social media provides a powerful platform for influencers to broadcast content to a large audience of followers. In order to reach the greatest number of users, an important first step is to identify times when a large portion of a target population is active on social media, which requires modeling the behavior of those individuals. We propose three methods for behavior modeling: a simple seasonality approach based on time-of-day and day-of-week, an autoregressive approach based on aggregate fluctuations from seasonality, and an aggregation-of-individuals approach based on modeling the behavior of individual users. We test these methods on data collected from a set of users on Twitter in 2011 and 2012. We find that the performance of the methods at predicting times of high activity depends strongly on the tradeoff between true and false positives, with no method dominating. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities involved in modeling complex social systems, and demonstrate how influencers interested in forecasting potential user engagement can use complexity modeling to make better decisions.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how digital traces of people's movements and activities in the physical world (e.g., at college campuses and commutes) may be used to detect local, short-lived events in various urban spaces. Past work that use occupancy-related features can only identify high-intensity events (those that cause large-scale disruption in visit patterns). In this paper, we first show how longitudinal traces of the coordinated and group-based movement episodes obtained from individual-level movement data can be used to create a socio-physical network (with edges representing tie strengths among individuals based on their physical world movement &amp; collocation behavior). We then investigate how two additional families of socio-physical features: (i) group-level interactions observed over shorter timescales and (ii) socio-physical network tie-strengths derived over longer timescales, can be used by state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods to detect a much wider set of both high &amp; low intensity events. We utilize two distinct datasets--one capturing coarse-grained SMU campus-wide indoor location data from hundreds of students, and the other capturing commuting behavior by millions of users on Singapore's public transport network--to demonstrate the promise of our approaches: the addition of group and socio-physical tie-strength based features increases recall (the percentage of events detected) more than 2-folds (to 0.77 on the SMU campus and to 0.73 at sample MRT stations), compared to pure occupancy-based approaches.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the suitability of three different null-models to motif analysis that all get as an input a desired degree sequence. A graph theoretic null-model is defined as a set of graphs together with a probability function. Here we discuss the configuration model, as the simplest model; a variant of the configuration model where multi-edges are deleted; and the set of all graphs with a given degree sequence (FDSM), that most scientists would recommend to use but that has the disadvantage of a high time-complexity to sample from it. Furthermore, we develop equations for the expected number of motifs in the FDSM, based on the degree sequence and the assumption of simple independence. We present the motif count for several real-world graphs and compare them with the sampled average number of these motif counts in the different null-models. We check with a Kolmogorov-Smirnow two-sample test whether the samples originated from the same distribution. It can then be shown that the motif counts in the configuration model do not coincide with those of the FDSM. The equations are a good enough approximation of the motif count in generated graphs based on a prescribed degree sequence.},

abstract = {Twitter is a pervasive technology, with hundreds of millions of users serving as sensors that provide eyewitness accounts of events on the ground. In case of popular events, these sensors start to broadcast news by tweeting to their followers, and to the world. Within minutes these tweets can attract attention and also serve as a primary information source for traditional media. Given a huge set of tweets, the key questions are: (1) How can we detect informative events in general? (2) How can we distinguish relevant events from others? In this paper we tackle these challenges with a statistical model for detecting events by spotting significant frequency deviations of the words' frequency over time. Besides single word events, our model also accounts for events composed of multiple co-occurring words, thus, providing much richer information. Our statistical process is complemented with an optimization algorithm to extract only non-redundant events, overall, providing the user with a succinct summary of the current events. We used our model to analyze 24 million geotagged tweets that have been sent in the US from April 9 to April 22, 2013 -- the time period of the Boston marathon bombing -- and we show that our approach can create multi-word events that efficiently summarize real-world events.},

abstract = {Social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) serves as a popular platform for online communication and information dissemination, where users can effectively share information such as their recent activities and plans. This kind of information is extremely valuable for building recommendation systems. For example, a user might wish to receive alerts whenever a concert takes place near his current location or when a party will be held in his neighborhood. However, such events may not be widespread across social networks, they have not received sufficient attention. Moreover, traditional event discovery and event extraction techniques trained from formal genres cannot be effectively adapted to this domain. In this paper, we present the first formal definition of social events, discuss the annotation challenges and release a benchmark for the research community. Further more, we propose two novel solutions for extracting elements from social events: (1) an unsupervised content segmentation framework to extract event phrases (2) utilize external knowledge bases to detect fine-grained event locations and unveil their background information. Experimental results convincingly demonstrate that our approach can accurately extract social events from social media.},

abstract = {We show that weak ties offer a useful theoretical lens for understanding the sharing and usage of community-contributed resources amongst educators in a large urban school district. Community-contributed resources include a rich variety of teaching and learning resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides, animations and simulations. In this research, we consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two community members view or access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property as well; we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8%. Insights from our model can be used to improve a collaborative filtering approach for resource recommendation by predicting future similarity between users in the network.},

Detecting communities with NMF can keep non-negative network physical definition and effectively capture communities-based structure in the low dimensional data space. However some NMF methods in community detection did not concern with more network inner structures or existing ground-truth community information.In this paper, we propose a novel pairwisely constrained nonnegative symmetric matrix factorization (PCSNMF) method, which not only consider symmetric community structures of undirected network, but also takes into consideration the pairwise constraints generated from some ground-truth group information to enhance the community detection. We compare our approaches with other NMF-based methods in three social networks, and experimental results for community detection show that our approaches are all feasible and achieve better community detection results.},

In particular we show that user engagement can be to a great extent predicted from such features. Moreover, from the analysis it clearly emerges that the choice of community definition and granularity deeply affect the predictive performance.},

In this study, we want to leverage networks dynamics and community structure to predict which are the future interactions more likely to appear.

Community detection is the task of discovering dense groups of vertices in a graph. Its one specific form is seed set expansion, which finds the best local community for a given set of seed vertices. Greedy, agglomerative algorithms, which are commonly used in seed set expansion, have been previously designed only for a static, unchanging graph. However, in many applications, new data is constantly produced, and vertices and edges are inserted and removed from a graph. We present an algorithm for dynamic seed set expansion, which incrementally updates the community as the underlying graph changes. We show that our dynamic algorithm outputs high quality communities that are similar to those found when using a standard static algorithm. The dynamic approach also improves performance compared to recomputation, achieving speedups of up to 600x.},

As a main outcome of this paper, it was found how the network reconstruction using statistical models has an increased robustness, as well as sensitivity, allowing to discover hidden correlations among the users.},

abstract = {Improving the egocentric network-based user's profile building process by taking into account the dynamic characteristics of social networks can be relevant in many applications. To achieve this aim, we propose to apply a time-aware method into an existing egocentric-based user profiling process, based on previous contributions of our team. The aim of this strategy is to weight user's interests according to their relevance and freshness. The time awareness weight of an interest is computed by combining the relevance of individuals in the user's egocentric network (computed by taking into account the freshness of their ties) with the information relevance (computed by taking into account its freshness). The experiments on scientific publications networks (DBLP/Mendeley) allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposition compared to the existing time-agnostic egocentric network-based user profiling process.},

abstract = {People in different regions or times may have different views and therefore may talk about different sub-topics in a social media. Versatility of a topic in this research refers to the degree to which a topic discussed in a social media covers different points of view or sub-topics. We introduce this notion of versatility for individual topics embedded in Twitter data originated from different regions over time. Uniqueness of a region with respect to a topic is first computed based on how its term distribution differs from those in other regions. Uniqueness values associated with all the regions for a topic are then used to compute its versatility. Since versatility of a topic captures its characteristics across different regions, identifying versatile topics can help understanding regional interests and thus providing region-dependent services. In addition, it becomes possible to identify regions with minority sub-topics, which can be buried easily. By analyzing topic versatility over time, furthermore, we can analyze the behavior of a topic in terms of when it is diverged or converged across the regions.},

We introduce a generalization of the BTER model of Seshadhri et al. by adding flexibility to community structure, and use this model to perform multi-scale graph anomaly detection. Specifically, probability models describing coarse subgraphs are built by aggregating node probabilities, and these related hierarchical models simultaneously detect deviations from expectation. This technique provides insight into the graphs' structure and helps contextualized detected event. For evaluation, two new hierarchical detectors are tested against a baseline Gaussian method on a synthetic graph sequence with seeded anomalies. We demonstrate that in a labeled setting with community structure, our graph statistics-based approach outperforms both a distribution-based detector and the baseline, accurately detecting anomalies at the node, subgraph, and graph levels.},

To this end, we face two new challenges that the classical authority analysis based methods do not encounter: how to discover and rank spots on the basis of 1) popularity (obscurity level) and 2) scenery quality. For the first challenge, we estimate the obscurity level of a spot in accordance with the visiting asymmetry between photographers who are familiar with a target city and those who are not. For the second challenge, the behavior of both viewers who browsed the images and photographers are analyzed per each spot. We also develop an application system to help users to explore sightseeing spots with different geographical granularities. Experimental evaluations and analysis on a real dataset well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

However, a large body of existing works on differentially private release of graphs have not answered the question about the upper bounds of privacy budgets. In this paper, for the first time, such a bound is provided. We prove that with a privacy budget of O(log n), there exists an algorithm capable of releasing a noisy output graph with edge edit distance of O(1) against the true graph. At the same time, the complexity of our algorithm Top-m Filter is linear in the number of edges m. This lifts the limits of the state-of-the-art, which incur a complexity of O(n2) where n is the number of nodes and runnable only on graphs having n of tens of thousands.},

Does a group express the same sentiment both in private and public? How can we compare the sentiments of different groups composed of multiple attributes? In this paper, we take an interdisciplinary approach towards mining the patterns of textual sentiments and metadata. First, we look into several existing hypotheses in social science on the interplay between user characteristics and sentiments, as well as the related evidence in the field of social network data analysis. Second, we present a dataset with unique features (Facebook users' chats and posts in multiple languages) and a procedure to process the data. Third, we test our hypotheses on this dataset and interpret the results. Fourth, under the subgroup-discovery paradigm, we present an approach with two algorithms that generalizes single-attribute testing. This approach provides more detailed insight into the relationships among attributes, and reveals interesting attribute-value combinations with distinct sentiments. Furthermore, it offers novel hypotheses for examination in future studies.},

In this paper, we pursue this approach under the assumption that we do not have access to this kind of data neither, thus allowing to cope with most social networks, where users can rate items and have friendship relationships. We exploit the user ratings polarity, i.e the fact that a rating can be positive (like) or negative (dislike), to infer negative ties.

Yet, the timing aspect, namely, finding not only which nodes should be seeded but also when to seed them, has not been sufficiently addressed. In this work, we revisit the problem of network seeding and demonstrate by simulations how an approach takes takes into account the timing aspect, can improve the rates of spread by over 23% compared to existing seeding methods. Such an approach has a wide range of applications, especially in cases where the network topology is easily accessible.},

Our results lend insight into both structural and informational properties of different types of identifiers that can be used and combined to construct cascades. In particular, significant differences are found in the structural properties of information cascades when hashtags as used as cascade identifiers, compared with other content features. We also explain apparent local information losses in cascades in terms of information obsolescence and cascade divergence; e.g., when a cascade branches into multiple, divergent cascades with combined capacity equal to the original.},

abstract = {Social media has become a part of our daily life and we use it for many reasons. One of its uses is to get our questions answered. Given a multitude of social media sites, however, one immediate challenge is to pick the most relevant site for a question. This is a challenging problem because (1) questions are usually short, and (2) social media sites evolve. In this work, we propose to utilize topic specialization to find the most relevant social media site for a given question. In particular, semantic knowledge is considered for topic specialization as it can not only make a question more specific, but also dynamically represent the content of social sites, which relates a given question to a social media site. Thus, we propose to rank social media sites based on combined search engine query results. Our algorithm yields compelling results for providing a meaningful and consistent site recommendation. This work helps further understand the innate characteristics of major social media platforms for the design of social Q&amp;A systems.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) are being intensively used by professional users (e.g., companies, politician, athletes, celebrities, etc) in order to interact with a huge amount of regular OSN users with different purposes (marketing campaigns, customer feedback, public reputation, etc). Hence, due to the large catalog of existing OSNs, professional users usually count with OSN accounts in different systems. In this context an interesting question is whether professional users publish the same information across their OSN accounts, or actually they use different OSNs in a different manner. We define as cross-posting activity the action of publishing the same information in two or more OSNs. In this paper we aim at characterizing the cross-posting activity of professional OSN users across three major OSNs, Facebook, Twitter and Google+. To achieve this goal we perform a large-scale measurement-based analysis across more than 2M posts collected from 616 professional users with active accounts in the three referred OSNs.},

abstract = {Fraud is a social process that occurs over time. We introduce a new approach, called AFRAID, which utilizes active inference to better detect fraud in time-varying social networks. That is, classify nodes as fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent. In active inference on social networks, a set of unlabeled nodes is given to an oracle (in our case one or more fraud inspectors) to label. These labels are used to seed the inference process on previously trained classifier(s). The challenge in active inference is to select a small set of unlabeled nodes that would lead to the highest classification performance. Since fraud is highly adaptive and dynamic, selecting such nodes is even more challenging than in other settings. We apply our approach to a real-life fraud data set obtained from the Belgian Social Security Institution to detect social security fraud. In this setting, fraud is defined as the intentional failing of companies to pay tax contributions to the government. Thus, the social network is composed of companies and the links between companies indicate shared resources. Our approach, AFRAID, outperforms the approaches that do not utilize active inference by up to 15% in terms of precision.},

abstract = {Internet and online-based social systems are rising as the dominant mode of communication in society. However, the public or semi-private environment under which most online communications operate under do not make them suitable channels for speaking with others about personal or emotional problems. This has led to the emergence of online platforms for emotional support offering free, anonymous, and confidential conversations with live listeners. Yet very little is known about the way these platforms are utilized, and if their features and design foster strong user engagement. This paper explores the utilization and the interaction features of hundreds of thousands of users on 7 Cups of Tea, a leading online platform offering online emotional support. It dissects the user's activity levels, the patterns by which they engage in conversation with each other, and uses machine learning methods to find factors promoting engagement. The study may be the first to measure activities and interactions in a large-scale online social system that fosters peer-to-peer emotional support.},

abstract = {In this work we study information leakage through discussions in online social networks. In particular, we focus on articles published by news pages, in which a person's name is censored, and we examine whether the person is identifiable (decensored) by analyzing comments and social network graphs of commenters. As a case study for our proposed methodology, in this paper we considered 48 articles (Israeli, military related) with censored content, followed by a threaded discussion. We qualitatively study the set of comments and identify comments (in this case referred as "leakers") and the commenter and the censored person. We denote these commenters as "leakers". We found that such comments are present for some 75% of the articles we considered. Finally, leveraging the social network graphs of the leakers, and specifically the overlap among the graphs of the leakers, we are able to identify the censored person. We show the viability of our methodology through some illustrative use cases.},

abstract = {Community-based question answering (CQA) platforms are crowd-sourced services for sharing user expertise on various topics, from mechanical repairs to parenting. While they naturally build-in an online social network infrastructure, they carry a very different purpose from Facebook-like social networks, where users "hang-out" with their friends and tend to share more personal information. It is unclear, thus, how the privacy concerns and their correlation with user behavior in an online social network translate into a CQA platform. This study analyzes one year of recorded traces from a mature CQA platform to understand the association between users' privacy concerns as manifested by their account settings and their activity in the platform. The results show that privacy preference is correlated with behavior in the community in terms of engagement, retention, accomplishments and deviance from the norm. We find privacy-concerned users have higher qualitative and quantitative contributions, show higher retention, report more abuses, have higher perception on answer quality and have larger social circles. However, at the same time, these users also exhibit more deviant behavior than the users with public profiles.},

While showing promising results, the existing urban fabric detection solutions are built without a clear understanding of the detection process chain. In this paper, we distinguish and analyze the different steps common to all urban profiling techniques. By evaluating the impact of each step of the process, we are able to propose a new solution that outperforms the state of the art techniques. Our approach uses the weekly periodicity of human activities, as well as a median-based filtering technique, resulting in a better clustering in terms of both coverage and entropy, as shown by results obtained on two large scale mobile traffic datasets covering the urban areas of Milan and Turin, in Italy.},

This paper investigates whether relations captured by online social networks can be used as a proxy for the relations in offline social networks, such as networks of human face-to-face (F2F) proximity and coauthorship networks. Particularly, the paper focuses on interactions of computer scientists in online settings (homepages, social networks profiles and connections) and offline settings (scientific collaboration, face-to-face communications during the conferences). We focus on quantitative studies and investigate the structural similarities and correlations of the induced networks; in addition, we analyze implications between networks. Finally, we provide a qualitative user analysis to find characteristics of good and bad proxies.},

abstract = {Various projections or views of a heterogeneous information network can be modeled using the graph OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing) framework for effective decision making. Detecting anomalous projections of the network can help the analysts identify regions of interest from the graph specific to the projection attribute. While most previous studies on outlier detection in graphs deal with outlier nodes, edges or subgraphs, we are the first to propose detection of graph cuboid outliers. Further we perform this detection in a query sensitive way. Given a general subgraph query on a heterogeneous network, we study the problem of finding outlier cuboids from the graph OLAP lattice. A Graph Cuboid Outlier (GCOutlier) is a cuboid with exceptionally high density of matches for the query. The GCOutlier detection task is clearly challenging because: (1) finding matches for the query (subgraph isomorphism) is NP-hard; (2) number of matches for the query can be very high; and (3) number of cuboids can be large. We provide an approximate solution to the problem by computing only a fraction of the total matches originating from a select set of candidate nodes and including a select set of edges, chosen smartly. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic datasets to showcase the execution time versus accuracy trade-off. Experiments on real datasets like Four Area and Delicious containing thousands of nodes reveal interesting GCOutliers.},

abstract = {The spread of "rumours" in Online Social Networks (OSNs) has grown at an alarming rate. Consequently, there is an increasing need to improve understanding of the social and technological processes behind this trend. The first step in detecting rumours is to identify and extract memes, a unit of information that can be spread from person to person in OSNs. This paper proposes four similarity scores and two novel strategies to combine those similarity scores for detecting the spread of memes in OSNs, with the end goal of helping researchers as well as members of various OSNs to study the phenomenon. The two proposed strategies include: (1) automatically computing the similarity score weighting factors for four elements of a submission and (2) allowing users to engage in the clustering process and filter out outlier submissions, modify submission class labels, or assign different similarity score weight factors for various elements of a submission using a visualization prototype. To validate our approach, we collect submissions on Reddit about five controversial topics and demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform the baseline.},

abstract = {On-line support forums are a common method for businesses to provide product support for customers. In addition to trouble-shooting and how-to guides, on-line forums also serve the important purpose of allowing customers to interact and discuss the business's products. These interaction are an important factor in influencing customer opinions, and subsequently the adoption and use of products and services. The identification of influential users on these forums would therefore enable businesses to more effectively disseminate information and communicate with customers.In this paper we develop a method for identifying influential users in support forums using topical expertise and social network analysis. One of the key challenges when analyzing influence in this context is that the users are generally less socially active than users on other social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. In order to address this issue we have taken a broader view of a social network and considered all of the users that a particular user has interacted with instead of just the subset of users for which there is an explicit relationship. The user's expertise in a particular category is then used to determine the weight or influence of each individual interaction. Finally, the influence of the top influential users is then categorized as positive or negative based on sentiment analysis of their posts.We have demonstrated our approach using data from the Cisco Support Community, an on-line question and answer forum for computer networking products and services. Preliminary results show that the method was able to identify influential users in a discussion forum for network security products.},

abstract = {In an ever-increasing variety of contexts, people are working collaboratively to solve problems and accomplish tasks. Yet the characteristics of teams that work effectively are not fully understood. We focus on the problem of identifying particularly effective teams in a large, complex, social network. More specifically, given some task, and taking into account measures of both the effectiveness of an individual and the strength of the pairwise ties between individuals, can we identify the subgroup of people who are most likely to accomplish said task? Our experimental work using the DBLP suggests that within any given subgroup, not all ties are of equal relevance. In fact, we show that focusing on the ties between one individual and the other group members will suffice. However, whereas the problem of finding the "best" subgroup is equivalent to MAX-CLIQUE and is thus hard to approximate, the problem of finding the best star is computationally tractable. We present experimental evidence justifying interest in the star, as opposed to the clique, and discuss algorithmic and complexity concerns.},

The visualization ensures that the same node always has the same position in each time slice so that it is easy to follow its development. It also allows filtering data and influencing node appearance based on properties. Additionally we offer a two dimensional comparison view for two time slices which highlights changes in graph structure and (if available) in measures of nodes. The presented visualization technique is implemented using web technology and is available in a web-based analytics workbench. We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques by an analysis of a data set from a learning community.},

abstract = {On Twitter, social capitalists use dedicated hashtags and mutual subscriptions to each other in order to gain followers and to be retweeted. Their methods are successful enough to make them appear as influent users. Indeed, applications dedicated to the influence measurement such as Klout and Kred give high scores to most of these users. Meanwhile, their high number of retweets and followers are not due to the relevance of the content they tweet, but to their social capitalism techniques. In order to be able to detect these users, we train a classifier using a dataset of social capitalists and regular users. We then implement this classifier in a web application that we call DDP. DDP allows users to test whether a Twitter account is a social capitalist or not and to visualize the data we use to make the prediction. DDP allows administrator to crawl data from a lot of users automatically. Furthermore, administrators can manually label Twitter accounts as social capitalists or regular users to add them into the dataset. Finally, administrators can train new classifiers in order to take into account the new Twitter accounts added to the dataset, and thus making evolve the classifier with these new recently collected data. The web application is thus a way to collect data, make evolve the knowledge about social capitalists and to keep detecting them efficiently.},

Towards this goal there is a constant development in areas such as opinion mining.

This makes it difficult to understand what users are personally interested in and more importantly what they are feeling towards these interests and how their interests transition through time. By studying both users' interests and emotions, simultaneously, one can further investigate the motivation behind these interests. Such findings can be useful to build better interest extraction models and algorithms that leverage personalized and recommendation services (e.g., ads. targeting, e-commerce and dating sites). In this paper, we propose the demonstration of a web visualization tool - EmoViz - which facilitates the further exploration of users' interests and their emotions at a global scale. Such tool, through the use of various visual components, aims to alleviate the problem of understanding what users of the world are interested in and the motivations behind their interests and feelings.},

In this work we present MUNA: a MUltiplex Network Analysis library that we have developed in both R and Python on top of igraph network analysis package. In its current version, MUNA provides primitives to build, edit and modify multiplex networks. It also provides a bunch of functions computing basic metrics on multiplex networks. However, the most interesting functionality provided by MUNA is probably the wide variety of available community detection algorithms. Actually, the library implements different approaches for community detection including: partition aggregation approaches, layer aggregation approaches and direct multiplex approaches such as the GenLouvain and MuxLicod algorithms. It also offers an extended list of multiplex community evaluation indexes.},

abstract = {The ability to accurately predict recipients of an email, while it is being composed, is of great practical importance for two reasons. First, prediction of recipients allows for effective "auto-complete" of this field, thereby improving user experience and reducing the overhead of manual typing of the recipient. Second, this capability allows the system to alert the user when she has typed unlikely recipients. Such alerts can help avoid human error that might result in forgetting relevant recipients, or, even worse, disclosure of personal or classified information.In this demonstration, a system that effectively predicts email recipients, given an email history, will be exhibited. The system takes into consideration a variety of email related features to achieve high accuracy. Extensive experimentation on diverse email corpora has shown that our system adapts well to a variety of domains (such as business, personal and political email). Conference participants will be able to view real emails sent, and to observe how well our system predicted the recipients. In addition, they will be able to "impersonate" users whose email history is already available to the system, to compose a new email, and to view the recipient predictions.},

abstract = {This paper presents collaboration trends for five Clinical and Translational Science Awardee (CTSA) institution to demonstrate the need for new evaluation metrics. Translational science, a methodology that bridges gaps between fundamental and applied science, has gained attention from both the medical research community and government funding agencies. To facilitate interdisciplinary research it is important to understand what aspects of the process act as a bottleneck and limit its effectiveness. Cultural norms within the scientific community make communication between disciplines difficult [1]. CTSAs are meant to help ease burdens and foster an environment where clinicians and basic scientists work together [2]. In 2013, NCATS director, Dr. Chris Austin, said the CTSAs operated "without particular encouragement or direction from the NIH, and this in a disjointed and uncoordinated fashion" [3]. Our intention is to highlight areas of concern and to demonstrate the need and potential for bibliometric translational indicators to help alleviate some of the difficulties with CTSA evaluation by determining the importance of basic scientists in research networks, discussing patterns of co-authorship by institution, and presenting two translational indicators, which can help institutions and funding agencies compare CTSA collaborative patterns.},

abstract = {Practitioners and researchers studying Natural Resource Governance (NRG) increasingly pay attention to Social Network Analysis (SNA). Recent research shows that social networks can be an important determinant when conflicting interests deteriorate natural resource dilemmas. Although SNA research nowadays provides various theoretical concepts, statistical programs and sophisticated modeling opportunities, there is surprisingly little literature on how to (not) generate an own set of SNA data. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to provide insights in the extraction of valued, reciprocal SNA ties by means of a semi-structured questionnaire. The data were gained among actors in the petroleum sector in Ghana. The paper will further discuss major challenges during the data gathering process and resulting implications for future research.},

We investigate the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of victimized computers and system trespassers. We've deployed research Honeypots on the computer networks of two academic institutions, collected information on successful brute force attacks (BFA) and system trespassing events (sessions), and used Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques, to depict and understand the correlation between spatial attributes (IP addresses) and hacking networks' topology. We mapped and explored hacking patterns and found that geography might set the behavior of the attackers as well as the topology of hacking networks. The contribution of this study stems from the fact that there are no prior studies of geographical influences on the topology of hacking networks and from the unique usage of SNA to investigate hacking activities. Looking ahead, our study can assist policymakers in forming effective policies in the field of cybercrime.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a method to analyze and synthesize a set of N networks that refer to a common scenario and that are comparable among each other. Examples of this type of data are: a set of collaboration networks, each defined for a different scientific field; or a set of ego networks, where egos belong to a same category; a set of governance networks, etc. For these kind of sets of networks it can be of interest to find a small number of representative networks that can serve as a condensed view of the data set. In a statistical perspective this goal amount to find a small number of networks that are able to typify the network structures starting from the observed ones. In addition, these networks should have a clear and interpretable profile in terms of their most relevant features and their specificity in contrast to the others. Given the set of N networks, we propose to find these representative networks by using the archetypal analysis, yielding what we call Archetypal Networks. The Archetypal Networks can serve to understand the data structure, as benchmarks for the other networks, and are useful also to compare networks among each other. We exemplify the proposed procedure by analyzing a set of 36 governance networks of public structures devoted to provide youth services and referring to 36 different territorial districts in Campania region in Italy. Our results highlight the presence of different network structures that can be interpreted in terms of the governance forms established in literature.},

With the prevalence of social media, people sharing experiences and opinions on personal health symptoms and concerns on social media are increasing. Mining those publicly available health related data potentially provides valuable healthcare insights. In this paper, we propose a real-time allergy surveillance system that first classifies tweets to identify those that mention actual allergy incidents using bag-of-words model and NaiveBayesMultinomial classifier and applies in-depth text and spatiotemporal analysis. Our experimental results show that the proposed system can detect predominant allergy types with high precision and that allergy-related tweet volume is highly correlated to the weather data (daily maximum temperature). We believe that this is the first study that examines a large-scale social media stream for in-depth analysis of allergy activities.},

abstract = {TV drama is a kind of big data, containing enormous knowledge of modern human society. As the character-centered stories unfold, diverse knowledge, such as economics, politics and the culture, is displayed. However, unless we have efficient dynamic multi-modal data processing and picture processing methods, we cannot analyze drama data effectively. Here, we adopt the recently proposed deep concept hierarchies (DCH) and convolutional-recursive neural network (C-RNN) models to analyze the social network between the drama characters. DCH uses multi hierarchies structure to translate the vision-language concepts of drama characters into diversified abstract concepts, and utilizes Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to improve the retrieval efficiency of organizing conceptual spaces. Adopting approximately 4400-minute data of TV drama - Friends, we process face recognition on the characters by using convolutional-recursive deep learning model. Then we establish the social network between the characters by deep concept hierarchies model and analyze their affinity and the change of social network while the stories unfold.},

One dataset contains the spatial networks of three Chinese-Indonesian houses in Surabaya, Indonesia, which are three merchants' houses built in different time periods in the past 100 years. The other dataset contains the spatial networks of six farmers' houses in the village of JinHsing, Taiwan, which were also built in different time periods in the past 100 years. The houses in Surabaya have been adapted for commerce-based urban life. The houses in JinHsing are part of the fabric of an agriculture settlement. Two groups of houses rooted in Chinese culture are differentiated by their natural environments, life-styles and social conditions. While the appearance, materials, construction and even floor-plans of these houses have changed dramatically over past century, certain patterns in spatial organizations persist. Using in-group and cross-group comparisons, the paper illustrates how the development of spatial organization of these houses reflects the cultural, social and economic statuses of the residents and the community.},

abstract = {This paper suggests a voting algorithm for predicting people's choices. Usually, once a new algorithm is offered, one needs to prove the soundness of the algorithm, i.e., showing that the algorithm does the thing it is set up to do. But in the case of election prediction algorithms it's not clear how to prove their soundness. This paper offers a way to deal with this problem by analysing the social networks of plays, following Shakespeare dictum: "all the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players", As you like it, act I scene VII.The advantage of this approach is clear. The story of Julius Caesar is part of our collective memory. We learn the leading characters views and opinions throughout the play. For example, we know that Brutus was against Caesar, while Antony supported Caesar, and opposed Brutus. By generating the social graph from a play, the problems of soundness is solved, which makes the process more scientific.The voting algorithm needs anchors for each party. The anchors are the characters/nodes whose opinions are clear and known. In the case of the play Julius Caesar, the anchors are Brutus and Cassius for the conspirators and Antony and Octavius for the supporters of Caesar. After the anchors were identified the voting algorithm uses simple random walks, to divide the network of characters into two parties. Now it is possible to examine the output of the voting algorithm and see that indeed the algorithm works correctly.},

abstract = {This article suggests a modeling framework to investigate the optimal strategy followed by a monopolistic firm to manipulate the process of opinion formation in a social network. We consider a network which consists of the monopolist and a set of consumers who communicate to form their beliefs about the underlying product quality. When consumers' initial beliefs are uniform, we analytically and numerically show that the firm's optimal influence strategy always involves targeting the most influential consumer. We characterize the optimal amount of resources that should be allocated by the firm to this kind of manipulative activity. For the case of non-uniform initial beliefs, we rely on numerical methods to show that the monopolist might have an incentive to target the least influential consumer if the latter's initial opinion is low enough. The equilibrium valuation of the good and the firm's profitability are minimized when consumers' limiting influences on the consensus belief are equal, implying that the monopolist benefits from the presence of consumers with divergent strategic locations in the network.},

abstract = {Global and national events in recent years have shown that online social media can be a force for good (e.g., Arab Spring) and harm (e.g., the London riots). In both of these examples, social media played a key role in group formation and organization, and in the coordination of the group's subsequent collective actions (i.e., the move from rhetoric to action). Surprisingly, despite its clear importance, little is understood about the factors that lead to this kind of group development and the transition to collective action. This paper focuses on an approach to the analysis of data from social media to detect weak signals, i.e., indicators that initially appear at the fringes, but are, in fact, early indicators of such large-scale real-world phenomena. Our approach is in contrast to existing research which focuses on analysing major themes, i.e., the strong signals, prevalent in a social network at a particular point in time. Analysis of weak signals can provide interesting possibilities for forecasting, with online user-generated content being used to identify and anticipate possible offline future events. We demonstrate our approach through analysis of tweets collected during the London riots in 2011 and use of our weak signals to predict tipping points in that context.},

abstract = {This paper develops a discrete-time, non-linear and time-variant model of opinion formation in a social network with global interactions to investigate the relationship between the final consensus belief and the set of agents' initial opinions. The model uses a novel and considerably intuitive updating rule, according to which the weight placed by an agent on another one's opinion in each period decreases continuously with the distance between their beliefs in the previous period. In this context, the first part of our analysis provides computational evidence that agents' beliefs converge and reach a consensus over time. For the two-agent case, it is then shown that the consensus belief is the simple arithmetic mean of initial opinions. When there are three agents in the network, the combined use of computational and analytical methods reveals a relatively more complex polynomial relationship between long-run and initial beliefs. In particular, our results for the three agent-case imply that the deviation of the limiting belief from the corresponding average of initial beliefs can be expressed as a third-degree polynomial function incorporating the pairwise differences of agents' starting beliefs.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSN) allow their users to organize their friends into groups, also known as social circles. These social circles can be used to better manage who has access to users' posted content and also to control the content posted from other users that they view. Unfortunately, these social circles are generated manually and this can be a laborious process for users with more than a few friends. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically generating social circles that takes into account both the profile information of the friends to be grouped and the social network connectivity between them, while it allows multiple membership of friends in social circles. The approach is based on an adaptation of the widely used Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and, despite the fact that it does not explicitly model social network connectivity, as other state of the art methods do, it manages to achieve results that are competitive and even better than those obtained from such methods, at a considerably lower computational cost.},

abstract = {In epistemic communities, people are said to be selected on their contribution in knowledge to the project (articles, codes, etc.). However, the socialization process is an important factor for inclusion, sustainability as a contributor, and promotion. Finally, what matters for being promoted? Being a good contributor? Being a good animator? Knowing the boss? We explore this question by looking at the election process for administrators in the English Wikipedia. We used the candidates' revisions and/or social attributes to construct a predictive model of promotion success, based on the candidates' past behavior and a random forest algorithm. Our model explains 78% of the results, which is better than the former models. It also helps to refine the explanation of the election process.},

abstract = {Social networks consist of a set of participants and the pairwise relationships between them. There are several different types of networks, such as directed networks, networks with typed edges, dynamic networks and signed networks, as well as any composition of different types of networks. We develop a novel way to analyze such networks by considering the qualitatively different social roles that each individual can play in a network. For example, in a directed network, the participants have two social roles -- an incoming edge role and an outgoing edge role which are associated with the popularity and activity of each individual.Each role or status and the corresponding connections define a subgraph. We model the subgraph as a layer, and show how to weight the edges connecting the layers to produce a consistent spectral embedding. This embedding can be used to compute social network properties of graphs of different types, to predict edges, edge types, and edge direction, as well as to track the change of role over time. We illustrate the approaches using synthetic and real-world datasets.},

abstract = {In analysing the structural organization of a social network, identifying important nodes has been a fundamental problem. The concept of network centrality deals with the assessment of the relative importance of a particular node within the network. Most of the traditional network centrality definitions have a high computational cost and require full knowledge of network topological structure. On the one hand, in many applications we are only interested in detecting the top-k central nodes of the network with the largest values considering a specific centrality metric. On the other hand, it is not feasible to efficiently identify central nodes in a large real-world social network via calculation of centrality values for all nodes. As a result, recent years have witnessed increased attention toward the challenging problem of detecting top k central nodes in social networks with high accuracy and without full knowledge of network topology. To this end, we in this paper present a compressive sensing approach, called CS-TopCent, to efficiently identify such central nodes as a sparsity specification of social networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method would converge to an accurate solution for a wide range of social networks.},

abstract = {Online social network platforms provide built-in functionalities that allow users to share information through their social connections. The study of information diffusion focusses on analysing how the spread of information enables us to understand the ways that users behave and interact online. Information diffusion manifests itself on social networks in the form of cascades of information, which are structural representations of diffusion events. The characteristics of information diffusion differ between online social networks partly depending on the capabilities of each. Tumblr is an online social network platform; it allows users to reblog more than once, to add a comment with a reblog, and to delete reblogs which presents certain challenges in the study of diffusion on this network. In this paper, we will identify and address those challenges, and we will examine the effects of these functionalities on users' behaviour and consequently on the structural characteristics of cascades on Tumblr.},

This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks, where new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of time. An alternative and more realistic approach, recently extensively explored, are temporal networks, i.e. networks that reflect the occurrence of events in time [1] and change in its nodes and edges.},

One of the relevant research domains intensively explored recently is analysis of social communities existing in social media as well as prediction of their future evolution taking into account collected historical evolution chains. These evolution chains proposed in the paper contain group states in the previous time frames and its historical transitions that were identified using Group Evolution Discovery (GED) method. Based on the observed evolution chains of various length, structural network features are extracted, validated and selected as well as used to learn classification models. The experimental studies were performed on three real datasets with different profile: DBLP, Facebook and Polish blogosphere. The process of group prediction was analysed with respect to different classifiers as well as various descriptive feature sets extracted from evolution chains of different length. The results revealed that, in general, the longer evolution chains the better predictive abilities of the classification models. However, chains of length 3 to 7 enabled the GED-based method to almost reach its maximum possible prediction quality.},

To address this gap in the literature, the language of hackers was analyzed to identify potential threats against critical infrastructures using automated analysis tools. First, discussion posts were collected from a selected hacker forum using a customized web-crawler. Posts were analyzed using a parts of speech tagger, which helped determine a list of keywords used to query the data. Next, a sentiment analysis tool scored these keywords, which were then analyzed to determine the effectiveness of this method.},

abstract = {Decision makers use information from a range of terrestrial and online sources to help underpin the processes through which they develop policies and react to events as they unfold. One such source of online information is social media. Twitter, as a form of social media, is a popular micro-blogging Web application serving hundreds of millions of users. User-generated content can be exploited as a rich source of information for identifying 'real-world' disruptive events. In this paper, we present an in-depth comparison of three types of features that could be useful for identifying disruptive events: temporal, spatial and textual. We make several interesting observations: first, disruptive events are identifiable regardless of the "influence of the user" discussing them, and over a variety of topics. Second, temporal features are the best event identifiers and hence should not be disregarded or ignored. Third, a combination of optimum textual features with temporal and spatial features achieves best performance in the event detection task. We believe that these findings provide new insights for gathering information around real-world events as well as a useful resource for improving situational awareness and decision support.},

Analyzing text at the surface level would treat related concepts (i.e. actors, actions, targets, and victims) as different objects, potentially missing common narrative patterns. Shallow parsers reveal semantic roles of words leading to subject-verb-object triplets. We developed a novel algorithm to extract information from triplets by clustering them into generalized concepts by utilizing syntactic criteria based on common contexts and semantic corpus-based statistical criteria based on "contextual synonyms". We show that generalized concepts representation of text (1) overcomes surface level differences (which arise when different keywords are used for related concepts) without drift, (2) leads to a higher-level semantic network representation of related stories, and (3) when used as features, they yield a significant 36% boost in performance for the story detection task.},

abstract = {Financial fines imposed by regulatory bodies to penalize illegal activities and violations against regulations (cases of non-compliance) have recently become more common, and the sizes of fines have increased. This development coincides with the ongoing increase of complexity of regulatory rules. Huge fines have been imposed on banks for financial fraud and regulations have been made more stringent after 9/11 to curb funding of terrorist groups. Market players would also like to have available a database of fine events for a range of applications, such as to benchmark their competitors performance, or to use it as an early warning system for detecting shifts in regulators' enforcement behavior. To this end, we introduce the task of extracting fines from regulatory enforcement actions and we present a method to extract such fine event instances from timeline-like descriptions of regulatory investigation activities authored by legal professionals for a commercial product. We evaluate how well a rule-based method can extract information about fine events and we compare its performance to a machine-learning baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one addressing this task.},

abstract = {Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose a threat to any service provider on the internet. While traditional DoS flooding attacks require the attacker to control at least as much resources as the service provider in order to be effective, so-called low-rate DoS attacks can exploit weaknesses in careless design to effectively deny a service using minimal amounts of network traffic.This paper investigates one such weakness found within version 2.2 of the popular Apache HTTP Server software. The weakness concerns how the server handles the persistent connection feature in HTTP 1.1. An attack simulator exploiting this weakness has been developed and shown to be effective. The attack was then studied with spectral analysis for the purpose of examining how well the attack could be detected.Similar to other papers on spectral analysis of low-rate DoS attacks, the results show that disproportionate amounts of energy in the lower frequencies can be detected when the attack is present. However, by randomizing the attack pattern, an attacker can efficiently reduce this disproportion to a degree where it might be impossible to correctly identify an attack in a real world scenario.},

abstract = {Massive online social networks with hundreds of millions of active users are increasingly being used by Cyber criminals to spread malicious software (malware) to exploit vulnerabilities on the machines of users for personal gain. Twitter is particularly susceptible to such activity as, with its 140 character limit, it is common for people to include URLs in their tweets to link to more detailed information, evidence, news reports and so on. URLs are often shortened so the endpoint is not obvious before a person clicks the link. Cyber criminals can exploit this to propagate malicious URLs on Twitter, for which the endpoint is a malicious server that performs unwanted actions on the person's machine. This is known as a drive-by-download. In this paper we develop a machine classification system to distinguish between malicious and benign URLs within seconds of the URL being clicked (i.e. 'real-time'). We train the classifier using machine activity logs created while interacting with URLs extracted from Twitter data collected during a large global event -- the Superbowl -- and test it using data from another large sporting event -- the Cricket World Cup. The results show that machine activity logs produce precision performances of up to 0.975 on training data from the first event and 0.747 on a test data from a second event. Furthermore, we examine the properties of the learned model to explain the relationship between machine activity and malicious software behaviour, and build a learning curve for the classifier to illustrate that very small samples of training data can be used with only a small detriment to performance.},

Using two different malware collections, we explore various circumstances for each - including cases where the training data differs significantly from test; where the malware being evaluated employs packing to thwart analytical techniques; and conditions with sparse training data. We find that this approach consistently out-performs the current state-of-the art software for malware task identification as well as standard machine learning approaches - often achieving an unbiased F1 score of over 0.9. In the near future, we look to deploy our approach for use by analysts in an operational cyber-security environment.},

In this work, we investigate the early detection of spamming accounts hosted by ESPs. Our study is based on a large real-life data set, consisting of mail logs involving tens of millions of email accounts hosted by a large, well-known, ESP.An analysis of our data set reveals that spammers tend to be clustered in the same communities within the graph induced by inter-account email communication. The reason for this phenomenon is, most likely, that spammers often use the same techniques for harvesting email addresses. As a result, they inadvertently spam each other or spam the same legitimate accounts. We leverage this accidental community structure for devising a highly accurate spammer detector that outperforms previous algorithms by a wide margin.},

abstract = {Certain crimes are difficult to be committed by individuals but carefully organised by group of associates and affiliates loosely connected to each other with a single or small group of individuals coordinating the overall actions. A common starting point in understanding the structural organisation of criminal groups is to identify the criminals and their associates. Situations arise in many criminal datasets where there is no direct connection among the criminals. In this paper, we investigate ties and community structure in crime data in order to understand the operations of both traditional and cyber criminals, as well as to predict the existence of organised criminal networks. Our contributions are twofold: we propose a bipartite network model for inferring hidden ties between actors who initiated an illegal interaction and objects affected by the interaction, we then validate the method in two case studies on pharmaceutical crime and underground forum data using standard network algorithms for structural and community analysis. The vertex level metrics and community analysis results obtained indicate the significance of our work in understanding the operations and structure of organised criminal networks which were not immediately obvious in the data. Identifying these groups and mapping their relationship to one another is essential in making more effective disruption strategies in the future.},

abstract = {The evolution of digital communication includes both applications and devices running them. In this context, specific applications are needed to enhance a safeguard communication ensuring protection and trust services to the users. The growing need to address privacy concerns when social network data is released for mining purposes has recently led to considerable interest in various network security-based applications. In this paper, we develop an efficiency and adaptive network security-based application to ensure the privacy and data integrity across channel communications. This approach is designed on a model of clustering configuration of the involved members. The cluster members interact with the cluster leader for data exchange and sends to the base station. This scheme provides a strong mutual authentication framework that suits for real heterogeneous wireless applications. In addition, we contribute with a mathematical analysis to the delay and optimization analysis in a clustering topology node-based, also we compared the scheme with existing ones using security standards services. Finally, performance of this scheme is evaluated in term of computation and communication overhead; results show the present framework is efficiency and can be safeguard for Network Security-based applications.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the practices employed by various terrorist groups that operated in European countries between the years of 1968 and 2009. We focus on the deployment of the terrorist operations as presented in the RAND Database of Worldwide Terrorism Activities. In this context we elaborate on the tactics of the terrorist groups with the highest frequency of actions that operated in the European countries showing the highest rate of terrorist activity. Their targets, the weapons used and the consequences suffered as a result of their actions (both fatalities and injuries intended for the original targets, as well as any kind of collateral damage caused to third parties) are analyzed, in order to evaluate their ideological and -- perhaps - ethical standing. In particular, we look at the groups' targets as well as the tactics they used to achieve them, in a bid to explore whether there is a correlation between targeting of specific people or groups of people or other types of targets with certain international events - and if so, how these events influenced the actions of the terrorists. Within this line of thought, we also provide an outline of the political and ideological framework of the groups on focus in an effort to place them within the general historical and political context during their operational years. This is of great importance, as it enables us to run a comparison between terrorist groups that operated in different countries (albeit with similar aims) both from an ideological and operational viewpoint.},

abstract = {The influential members of a criminal organization are usually targeted by criminal investigators for removal or surveillance. Identifying and capturing these influential members will most likely to disrupt the organization. We propose in this paper a forensic analysis system called CLDRI that can identify the most influential members of a criminal organization. First, a network representing a criminal organization is built from Mobile Communication Data that belongs to the organization. In such a network, a vertex represents an individual criminal and an edge represents the communication attempts between two criminals. CLDRI employs formulas that quantify the degree of importance of each vertex in the network relative to all other vertices. We present these formulas through series of improvement refinements. All the formulas incorporate novel-weighting schemes for the edges of networks. We evaluated the quality of CLDRI by comparing it experimentally with two systems. Results showed improvement.},

abstract = {As the data generated on the internet exponentially increases, developing guided data collection methods become more and more essential to the research process. This paper proposes an approach to building a self-guiding web-crawler to collect data specifically from extremist websites. The guidance component of the web-crawler is achieved through the use of sentiment-based classification rules which allow the crawler to make decisions on the content of the webpage it downloads. First, content from 2,500 webpages was collected for each of the four different sentiment-based classes: pro-extremist websites, anti-extremist websites, neutral news sites discussing extremism and finally sites with no discussion of extremism. Then parts of speech tagging was used to find the most frequent keywords in these pages. Utilizing sentiment software in conjunction with classification software a decision tree that could effectively discern which class a particular page would fall into was generated. The resulting tree showed an 80% success rate on differentiating between the four classes and a 92% success rate at classifying specifically extremist pages. This decision tree was then applied to a randomly selected sample of pages for each class. The results from the secondary test showed similar results to the primary test and hold promise for future studies using this framework.},

abstract = {Evaluation of network visualization tools in software engineering is a tricky task. There are a number of factors, contradictions, and preferences of investigative analysts that are to be kept in consideration while designing the experiment. Complexity in data, computational overhead to reach the targeted information and scarcity of a standard platform may slow down the investigation process. In this research paper, we have made the evaluation of some of the new features of our proposed framework, PEVNET, by conducting an experiment. There were twenty four participants who had evaluated the system. The experiment was performed in two phases. In the first phase, a usability evaluation and qualitative feedback was carried out to check whether the PEVNET framework provided adequate results to the users. The qualitative feedback was performed by considering two aspects: the ease of use and the functionality. We have conducted an evaluation of the newly inducted features into PEVNET. These include the 'Pie-chart feature', 'Trend analysis Feature', 'Graphical trend analysis feature', and 'Encircle feature'. In the second phase, the comparison of the PEVNET had been performed against some other state-of-the-art tools. These tasks were to be performed in the groups of participants. We found that the participants of the PEVNET group performed the tasks faster, in respect to the respective features, as compared to the other techniques used in the experiment. Further, we have found that the network visualization of the PEVNET framework, based on the experimental results, had gotten satisfactory feedback from the majority of the participants. The case study of Chicago Narcotics datasets was used. We believe that by evaluating the PEVNET in this research paper, we will be able to check the effectiveness of our proposed features.},

These patient records contain valuable medical information including patient information, diagnosis, treatment methods, and eventual patient outcomes. It is important to analyze patterns within these records in order to more efficiently treat individuals. In this paper, we present a method for automatically discovering underlying themes and patterns within patient data. Our methodology includes the creation of the main themes or patterns in the data and linking the themes back to the corpus from which they were generated. In our research, we partitioned graphs from terms gathered from electronic health records. Modularity was used as the quality function, which strives to measure how well a given partition of a network compartmentalizes its communities. We have compared our method with probabilistic topic modeling algorithms, specifically LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Finally, recall and precision measures were used to evaluate the validity of our final results.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of adding a large unlabeled sample from the target domain to boost the performance of a domain adaptation algorithm when only a small set of labeled examples are available from the target domain. In particular, we consider the problem setting motivated by the task of splice site prediction. For this task, annotating a genome using machine learning requires a lot of labeled data, whereas for non-model organisms, there is only some labeled data and lots of unlabeled data. With domain adaptation one can leverage the large amount of data from a related model organism, along with the labeled and unlabeled data from the organism of interest to train a classifier for the latter. Our goal is to analyze the three ways of incorporating the unlabeled data -- with soft labels only (i.e., Expectation-Maximization), with hard labels only (i.e., self-training), or with both soft and hard labels -- for the splice site prediction in particular, and more broadly for a general iterative domain adaptation setting. We provide empirical results on splice site prediction indicating that using soft labels only can lead to better classifier compared to the other two ways.},

This study addresses the potential utilization of OSN as a support tool for the decision-making process. To better understand the relationship between decision making and support and OSN, this research will focus on Healthcare-orientated Online Social Networks (HOSN).

abstract = {Stroke is the second single highest cause of death in Europe. The low reliability of animal models in replicating the human disease is one of the most serious problems in the field of medical and pharmaceutical research about stroke. The standard models for the study of ischemic stroke are often poorly predictive as they simulate only partially the human disease. This work aims at investigating animal models with diseases typically associated with the onset of stroke in human patients.We have designed and realised a knowledge base for collecting, elaborating, and extracting analytical results of genomic, proteomic, biochemical, morphological investigations from animal models of cerebral stroke. Data analysis techniques are tailored to make the data available for processing and correlation, in order to increase the predictive value of the preclinical data, to perform biosimulation studies, and to support both academic and industrial research in the area of cerebral stroke therapy. A first statistical analysis of the retrieved information leads to the validation of our animal models and suggests a predictive and translational value for parameters related to a specific model. In particular, concerning gene expression data, we have applied a data analysis pipeline that initially takes into account an initial set of 64,000 genes and brings down the focus on a few tens of them.},

We propose here a method for predicting protein complexes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, using information on mutually exclusive PPIs. If two interactions are mutually exclusive, they are not allowed to exist simultaneously in the same predicted complex. We introduce a new regularization term which checks whether predicted complexes are connected by mutually exclusive PPIs. This regularization term is added into the scoring function of our earlier protein complex prediction tool, PPSampler2. We show that PPSampler2 with mutually exclusive PPIs outperforms the original one. Furthermore, the performance is superior to well-known representative conventional protein complex prediction methods. Thus, it is is effective to use mutual exclusiveness of PPIs in protein complex prediction.},

In this study we tried to find epitopes for superficial glycoprotein of Zaire ebolavirus (that have high antigenicity for MHC I, II and B cells) with use of in-silico methods and immunoinformatics approach. By use of CTLPred, SYFPEITHI and Propred web applications for MHC class I and SYFPEITHI and Propred1web applications for MHC class II we had been able to find epitopes (peptides) that have highest score. Also ElliPro, IgPred and Discotope web tools had been performed to predict B cells epitopes. The sequence "SRFTPQFLL" and "IFFLYDRLAS" were selected to be epitopes for MHCs molecules. The region 255 to 310 was selected for B cell epitope. It was expected these peptides could be stimulated immune response and used for designing multi-peptide vaccine against ZEV but these results should be reliable with experimental analysis.},

abstract = {Anonymity, speed and big data are all ingredients at the basis of an intense online medical information prosumerism supported by search-engines, websites, forums and social networks. Fostering reliable medical ecosystems requires an exploitation of such data, controlling quality and delineating user behaviors. This strongly emerges with chronic patients: they are expected to devote a long use of the Internet on the same health topics; nonetheless a limited amount of research has investigated their online resources and behavior. We uncover the role of online social networks for a growing community of chronic patients: Crohn's disease patients. Our contribution is twofold: (a) we characterize the data exchanged by Crohn's patients, (b) while analyzing how they deal with given topics of medical interest. In particular, of great medical relevance is the result that Infliximab is the treatment that mostly influences the Crohn's patient community sentiments. We are confident our analysis of the health heritage exchanged online can help improve Crohn's patients' experience, exceeding the traditional practices that typically concentrate on individuals rather than on communities.},

abstract = {In the last few years we are witnessing to an increasing interest in the application of social network analysis and methods to health care information and management systems. The utilization of information technologies that could significantly improve efficiency and effectiveness of health care strategies are very important because of the implications they could have in everyday life of individuals. In this paper, we predict the onset of future diseases on the base of the current health status of patients. The problem of predicting the relations between diseases is a really difficult and, at the same time, an important task. For this purpose, this paper first constructs a weighted disease network and then, it proposes a novel link prediction method with supervised strategy to identify the connections between diseases, building the evolving structure of the disease network with respect to patients' ages. Experiments on a real network demonstrate that the proposed approach can reveal disease correlations accurately and perform well at capturing future disease risks.},

abstract = {This paper concerns multi-agent models predicting Twitter trends. We use a step-wise approach to develop a novel agent-based model with the following properties: (1) it uses individual behavior parameters for a set of Twitter users and (2) it uses a retweet graph to model the underlying social network structure of these Twitter users to predict trends. The model parameters can be optimized using empirical data. To investigate to what extend this agent-based model can predict Twitter trends, we validate the model performance on two case studies using real Twitter data: tweets on banks and tweets on universities. We furthermore compare a version of the model that only uses the retweet graph (PM1) with the model that also simulates individual behavior (PM2) for small to larger prediction time intervals. For both case studies the results show that PM1 performs better for small prediction time intervals (up to one day in the future), while PM2 performs better for larger time intervals (from a day to a week). We think this opens up the possibility to use similar models for helping organizations to extend their monitoring capabilities of social media with predictive modeling and to become more pro-active and less reactive.},

By analyzing big datasets from FIMI website of up to one million transactions we were able to detect not only the most frequent sequential itemsets but any sequential itemset occurred at least twice in the transactions' database. For this purpose we have used a novel data structure the LERP Reduced Suffix Array and the innovative ARPaD algorithm which allows the detection of all repeated patterns in a string. The methodology uses a pre-statistical analysis of the transactions that allows constructing in a very efficient way smaller LERP-RSA data structures for each transaction. The integration and classification of all LERP-RSAs let ARPaD algorithm to be executed in parallel and to detect every sequential itemset that occurs at least twice in a very efficient way.},

This paper focuses on the relationship between students' academic performance and their participation in the course forum. It also studies the semantics of both students and TAs' posts in the course forum in order to understand their behavior in the forum. We found those who achieve higher scores tend to be more active in forum. But they also write a higher percentage of posts that are unrelated to the course than those who get lower scores. TAs are not very active in the forum and they have limited impacts. This paper talks about the problems of current course forum participation and presents some suggestions for MOOC forum.},

abstract = {Studying social networks and the ties connecting people in those networks has attracted many researchers. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Flickr require efficient and accurate methods to recommend friends to their users in the network. Several algorithms have been developed to recommend friends or predict likelihood of future links. Link Prediction algorithms utilize local features of the network in the neighborhood of the two nodes in question, or use global features like path structure of the whole network. New algorithms tend to combine both in order to achieve the best results such as FriendTNS that takes into account the degrees of the nodes, and the direct links between them. This paper extends FriendTNS such that it takes the strength of the tie between two users into account. The strength of the tie is represented by the interaction that takes place between two users. In order to evaluate the correctness of the proposed model, it has been applied on a real dataset of 2.974k users on the Twitter social network. The proposed model considers different features of users to represent their connective and social relationships. Experiments shows that the proposed model outperforms traditional algorithms when applied individually.},

abstract = {Link prediction is a well-known problem in field of social network analysis which intends to guess the likelihood of the occurrences of connections between nodes. By using the structure of the network up to a given time appearance of links in future can be predict. In the most of previous studies, for performing the link prediction task just according to the exploration of the state of the network at a specific moment by applying the proximity metrics like topological based metrics to non-connected nodes has been used in order to predict new links. In those studies the behavior of links along the time or directed networks didn't considered which can be point as a limitation in link prediction studies. In this study we tried to overcome the above mentioned limitation by analyzing the development of topological measures in a citation network on a specific pried of time. For achieving this aim, chosen similarity matric deployed to all non-connected pairs of nodes in different frames of time in the network. Then, time frames are built for each pair to record their values which provided by the metric. Experiments on unsupervised prediction on a directed citation network show that the proposed method finds satisfactory results and is promising.},

The analysis of their intricate structure is relevant to many areas of science and commerce, and data sets may reach sizes that require distributed storage and processing. We describe and compare programming models for distributed computing with a focus on graph algorithms for large-scale complex network analysis. Four frameworks -- GraphLab, Apache Giraph, Giraph++ and Apache Flink -- are used to implement algorithms for the representative problems Connected Components, Community Detection, PageRank and Clustering Coefficients. The implementations are executed on a computer cluster to evaluate the frameworks' suitability in practice and to compare their performance to that of the single-machine, shared-memory parallel network analysis package NetworKit. Out of the distributed frameworks, GraphLab and Apache Giraph generally show the best performance. In our experiments a cluster of eight computers running Apache Giraph enables the analysis of a network with about 2 billion edges, which is too large for a single machine of the same type. However, for networks that fit into memory of one machine, the performance of the shared-memory parallel implementation is far better than the distributed ones. The study provides experimental evidence for selecting the appropriate framework depending on the task and data volume.},

abstract = {Web-based platforms, such as social networks, review web-sites, and e-commerce web-sites, commonly use recommendation systems to serve their users. The common practice is to have each platform captures and maintains data related to its own users. Later the data is analyzed to produce user specific recommendations. We argue that recommendations could be enriched by considering data consolidated from multiple sources instead of limiting the analysis to data captured from a single source. Integrating data from multiple sources is analogous to watching the behavior and preferences of each user on multiple platforms instead of a limited one platform based vision. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which utilizes user specific data collected from multiple platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to make recommendations by consulting multiple social networks to produce a rich modeling of user behavior. For this purpose, we collected and anonymized a specific dataset that contains information from BlogCatalog, Twitter and Flickr web-sites. We implemented several different types of recommendation methodologies to observe their performances while using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources. The conducted experiments showed that using multiple features from multiple social networks produces a wider perspective of user behavior and preferences leading to improved recommendation outcome.},

We describe an experiment to tune and evaluate the algorithm using a corpus of 35 million Twitter messages and 6,112 New York Times articles on a variety of topics. Finally, we describe an online user study (N=200) to evaluate user perceptions of content recommended by our algorithm. Results show significant differences in user perception of newsworthiness and uniqueness of content from our algorithm.},

abstract = {For a long time now, researchers have worked on defining different metrics able to characterize the importance of nodes in networks. Among them, centrality measures have proved to be pertinent as they relate the position of a node in the structure to its ability to diffuse an information efficiently. The case of dynamic networks, in which nodes and links appear and disappear over time, led the community to propose extensions of those classical measures. Yet, they do not investigate the fact that the network structure evolves and that node importance may evolve accordingly. In the present paper, we propose temporal extensions of notions of centrality, which take into account the paths existing at any given time, in order to study the time evolution of nodes' importance in dynamic networks. We apply this to two datasets and show that the importance of nodes does indeed vary greatly with time. We also show that in some cases it might be meaningless to try to identify nodes that are consistently important over time, thus strengthening the interest of temporal extensions of centrality measures.},

abstract = {The increased usage of Twitter as a medium for reporting news and sharing information between people has caught the attention of researchers from different disciplines. One of the research directions is the analysis of online information from the perspective of its credibility. This paper aims to assess and analyze the credibility of tweets in Arabic language. In order to achieve the stated goal, first we employ the idea of crowdsourcing where users can explicitly express their opinions about credibility of a set of tweets. This information coupled with the data about tweets' features enable us to investigate which features may indicate the credibility level of a tweet, e.g. tweet with attached image and was authored by a person who posts a lot of tweets will be, with high probability, a credible tweet. We distinguish three main groups of features: authority and topical expertise (of the source), data quality (of the content), and popularity (of the content and the source). We argue that content data quality factor based on content linguistic features in addition to source authority is more important than content popularity in identifying credible messages. In addition to this, we identified three experts who also rated the credibility of tweets and based on that we investigate the level of agreement between experts and the crowd, and we identify which expert represents the crowd in the best way. This can allow us to select the most representative expert when it is needed. This study is a pilot of a large study that aims at predicting credibility of Arabic Twitter messages using machine learning approaches.},

abstract = {Churn prediction is a customer relationship process that predicts for customers who are at the brink of transferring all the business to competitor. It is predicted by modeling customer behaviors in order to extract patterns. An acquaintance of a customer is more costly than retainment of an existing customer. Churn predictions shed light on members about to leave the service and support promotion activities. These attempts are utilized to avoid subscription cancellation of existing customers. Nowadays, telecommunication companies take churn prediction very serious. They strive for monitoring customers in the business by using various applications in systematic approach. Our study is based on leading internet service providing company, Turksat Satellite Communications and Cable TV Operations Company's customer behavior analysis. It is the leading internet service provider of Turkey operating in telecommunications sector. We have created a two-phase solution utilizing data mining techniques. These are time series clustering and classification techniques.},

abstract = {Retweet has become one of the most prominent feature on social networks and an important mean for secondary content promotion. Most existing investigations of retweet behaviors on social networks are conducted based on empirical studies or information diffusion models (such as stochastic process or cascading model). To the best of our knowledge, such a retweet process has not been investigated as a chaotic process. In this paper, we have first examined that retweet time series by 0-1 test where the results provide identification of chaotic behaviors. Furthermore, taking into account of the proven chaotic characteristic, chaos LS-SVM prediction method is applied to form predictions using only a small fraction of the retweet time series. Our evaluation on Sina Weibo dataset and comparisons with a bayesian model and strawman modal show that this nonlinear prediction method can translate to good step ahead forecasts and perform high accuracy in retweet prediction.},

abstract = {A rapid increase in the number of questions posted on community question answering (CQA) forums is creating a need for automated methods of question quality moderation to improve the effectiveness of such forums in terms of response time and quality. Such automated approaches should aim to classify questions as good or bad for a particular forum as soon as they are posted based on the guidelines and quality standards defined/listed by the forum. Thus, if a question meets the standard of the forum then it is classified as good else we classify it as bad. In this paper, we propose a method to address this problem of question classification by retrieving similar questions previously asked in the same forum, and then using the text from these previously asked similar questions to predict the quality of the current question. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the set of StackOverflow data, a massive CQA forum for programmers, comprising of about 8M questions. With the use of these additional text retrieved from similar questions, we are able to improve the question quality prediction accuracy by about 2.8% and improve the recall of negatively scored questions by about 4.2%. This improvement of 4.2% in recall would be helpful in automatically flagging questions as bad (unsuitable) for the forum and will speed up the moderation process thus saving time and human effort.},

Previous studies analyzed users' social search behavior using (broadcasted) status messages on social networking platforms to communicate information needs (Status Message Question Asking, SMQA) and revealed a limited willingness of information seekers to use SMQA when comparing it to traditional search engines. We describe the results of a survey with 112 participants and show that directly approaching well chosen friends is considered more attractive and is associated with higher expectations in terms of response quality than SMQA. Our findings suggest that users anticipate quality improvements gained from forwarding queries especially for certain content types of information needs and that response time is an important factor.},

abstract = {In the past years a lot of effort has been spent analyzing online social network data to understand how the world reality is reflected in the "virtual" world. Twitter is by far the network most used in these studies, given its policy of public data availability. However, a big discussion is still on on whether the data available is enough to make user characterization or event outcomes prediction, and what are the pitfalls people do not usually account for. In this direction, we propose a new methodology for drawing representative samples from Twitter data, which is divided into four phases: (i) user filtering, (ii) user demographic characterization, (iii) user sampling, and (iv) event prediction. The methodology is tested into a common scenario in Twitter event outcome prediction: elections. The methodology was tested with municipality elections from six different Brazilian cities, and compared to official election results. Results show it is worth further investigating the topic, but that a very hight number of messages is required to match real data distributions.},

This paper presents an analytical tool that was created to analyze the deeper relationships in the email data. Those include relationships based on an interaction of multiple users in a team. The analytical methods proposed and described in this paper are based on two factors. The first factor is the context, which is a group of multiple users in combination with terms used in the communication. The second factor is the time interval in which the communication was conducted. Based on these factors, we analyze the conversations that take place and get results that are in several different forms presented to the users. The paper presents methods for weighting conversations, users and relationships, as well as methods for finding communities associated with the specified context. Additionally, the concept of the explorative user interface is introduced.},

abstract = {The question that whether Twitter data can be leveraged to forecast outcome of the elections has always been of great anticipation in the research community. Existing research focuses on leveraging content analysis for positivity or negativity analysis of the sentiments of opinions expressed. This is while, analysis of link structure features of social networks underlying the conversation involving politicians has been less looked. The intuition behind such study comes from the fact that density of conversations about parties along with their respective members, whether explicit or implicit, should reflect on their popularity. On the other hand, dynamism of interactions, can capture the inherent shift in popularity of accounts of politicians. Within this manuscript we present evidence of how a well-known link prediction algorithm, can reveal an authoritative structural link formation within which the popularity of the political accounts along with their neighbourhoods, shows strong correlation with the standing of electoral outcomes. As an evidence, the public time-lines of two electoral events from 2014 elections of Sweden on Twitter have been studied. By distinguishing between member and official party accounts, we report that even using a focus-crawled public dataset, structural link popularities bear strong statistical similarities with vote outcomes. In addition we report strong ranked dependence between standings of selected politicians and general election outcome, as well as for official party accounts and European election outcome.},

Understanding it could lead to appealing applications such as city planning and epidemiology. In this paper, we focus on predicting whether two individuals are friends based on their mobility information. Intuitively, friends tend to visit similar places, thus the number of their co-occurrences should be a strong indicator of their friendship. Besides, the visiting time interval between two users also has an effect on friendship prediction. By exploiting machine learning techniques, we construct two friendship prediction models based on mobility information. The first model focuses on predicting friendship of two individuals with only one of their co-occurred places' information. The second model proposes a solution for predicting friendship of two individuals based on all their co-occurred places. Experimental results show that both of our models outperform the state-of-the-art solutions.},

It's a local method, where each node interacts with its neighbourhood to change its own label. Unfortunately, this method has two major drawbacks. The first is a bad propagation which can lead to obtain huge communities without sense (monster communities problem). The second is the instability of the method. Each trial of a label propagation algorithm gives rarely the same result. In this paper, we propose to do a study on the label propagation by putting artificial dams on edges of some networks in order to limit the propagation and to observe if this can lead to better results. We then apply an existing method based on a co-occurrence frequency matrix in order to stabilise the algorithm.},

Among the material resources used in the development of this research are: SNA metrics (network and species level) and the programs used for its calculation; Statistical Analysis approach (Exploratory Data Analysis and Multivariate Data Analysis) as a support tool; and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to formalize the methodology. From this research, we found that a systematic method to guide the steps one research can facilitate the researchers' works and the interaction with experts from several fields of knowledge.

abstract = {Multiplex networks, a special type of multilayer networks, are increasingly applied in many domains ranging from social media analytics to biology. A common task in these applications concerns the detection of community structures. Many existing algorithms for community detection in multiplexes attempt to detect communities which are shared by all layers. In this article we propose a community detection algorithm, LART (Locally Adaptive Random Transitions), for the detection of communities that are shared by either some or all the layers in the multiplex. The algorithm is based on a random walk on the multiplex, and the transition probabilities defining the random walk are allowed to depend on the local topological similarity between layers at any given node so as to facilitate the exploration of communities across layers. Based on this random walk, a node dissimilarity measure is derived and nodes are clustered based on this distance in a hierarchical fashion. We present experimental results using networks simulated under various scenarios to showcase the performance of LART in comparison to related community detection algorithms.},

abstract = {It is a common problem that cost of extracting data for network analysis could be very high. Also sometimes in the Internet is it hard to find graph with desired features such as node degree or clustering level. Because of that graph generators can than be very helpful. In the past bunch of models of such generators was developed: random graphs, small worlds and scale free networks. All of these generators were developed to quickly and efficiently create networks with desired parameters. However all of this models produce single layer graphs. Domain of multiplexes or multilayer graphs has not already been so deeply analysed, also because it is hard to collect multilayer data among real datasets or there is hard to define what kind of information layers exactly should represent. Proposed MuNeG --- Multilayer Network Generator can produce, based on set of input parameters, multiplex networks - networks where each node has its counterpart in each layer. The carried out experiments proved that MuNeG graphs have different network and social parameters depends on input values. This feature gives user a very handful tool to generate multiplex networks on purpose of social network or complex network analysis. Generator features, input parameters and their influence on so called graph theory measures such as: node degree, average shortest path, diameter or clustering are described in the following article.},

A population represents a group of interconnected individuals sharing information. In this paper, the population we generate is detailed by socio-cultural features, specifically the way that people tend to link together. To this end, the use of a social network is a little bit restrictive: people are linked by only one relationship. Multidimensional Social Networks (MSN) model 3D social networks where each dimension represent a kind of relationship [1]. The MSN architecture allows us to better represent the diversity of humans relations but also define distinctive rules for the simulation of the message diffusion. The inner idea is that information disseminates differently according to the links through which the information propagates. So, we present in this paper the modeling of our MSN based on social science and a simulation using propagation rules for each dimension.},

abstract = {Performance of cluster ensemble approaches is now known to be tightly related to both quality and diversity of input base clusterings. Cluster ensemble selection (CES) refers to the process of filtering the raw set of base clusterings in order to select a subset of high quality and diverse clusterings. Most of existing CES approaches apply one index for measuring the quality and another for evaluating the diversity of clusterings. Moreover the number of clusterings to select is usually given as an input to the CES function. In this work we propose a new CES approach that allow taking into account an ensemble of quality and diversity indexes. In addition, the proposed approach computes automatically the number of clusterings to return. The basic idea is to define a multiplex network over the provided set of base clusterings. Each slice in the multiplex network is obtained by defining a proximity-graph over the set of base clusterings using a given clustering dissimilarity index. A community detection algorithm is applied to the obtained multiplex network. We then rank clusterings in each community applying an ensemble-ranking approach using different (internal) clustering quality indexes. From each community we select the base clustering ranked at the top. First experiments on benchmark datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed CES approach.},

abstract = {We address the problem of finding local patterns and local rules in an attributed graph. A (global) closed pattern is the most specific attribute pattern shared by the vertices of the (possibly simplified) subgraph induced by some attribute pattern. A local closed pattern is the maximal attribute pattern associated to a particular dense region of this subgraph. As such local regions, we are in particular interested in k-communities of pattern subgraphs. In this case we show that there is a closure operator such that, given a pattern q subgraph and a k-community in this subgraph, returns the local closed pattern shared by all the members of the community. We then consider how to generate triples (c, e, l) where c is a (global) closed pattern whose subgraph contains e as a k-community, and l is the corresponding local closed pattern. This leads to implication rules expressing what new attributes are specific of the k-community e in the pattern c subgraph.},

abstract = {Identification of important actors in social networks is a hard task but with various interesting applications such as in information recommendation or for viral marketing. Existing centrality measures evaluate the importance of an actor in considering only the structural positions regardless of prior information on these actors such as their popularity, accessibility or behavior. A few measures have been proposed for weighted networks, notably the three common measures of centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness. However, these extended versions have solely focused on the weights of ties and not on the attributes of nodes. This article proposes generalizations that combine these both aspects. We present a set of measures, based on conventional centrality indicators, suited to weighted attributed graphs where the nodes are characterized by attributes. We illustrate the benefits of this approach on real attributed graphs. Experiments have validated the contribution of the links weights and attributes, especially for the detection of information broadcasters in social networks.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding recent work which has demonstrated the potential of using Twitter messages for content-specific data mining and analysis, the depth of such analysis is inherently limited by the scarcity of data imposed by the 140 character tweet limit. In this paper we describe a novel approach for targeted knowledge exploration which uses tweet content analysis as a preliminary step. This step is used to bootstrap more sophisticated data collection from directly related but much richer content sources. In particular we demonstrate that valuable information can be collected by following URLs included in tweets. We automatically extract content from the corresponding web pages and treating each web page as a document linked to the original tweet show how a temporal topic model based on a hierarchical Dirichlet process can be used to track the evolution of a complex topic structure of a Twitter community. Using autism-related tweets we demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing a much more meaningful picture of information exchange than user-chosen hashtags.},

abstract = {Sentiment Analysis is a technique to identify people's opinion, attitude, sentiment, and emotion towards any specific target such as individuals, events, topics, product, organizations, services etc. Sarcasm is a special kind of sentiment that comprise of words which mean the opposite of what you really want to say (especially in order to insult or wit someone, to show irritation, or to be funny). People often expressed it verbally through the use of heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes. These tonal and gestural clues are obviously not available for expressing sarcasm in text, making its detection reliant upon other factors. In this paper, two approaches to detect sarcasm in the text of Twitter data were proposed. The first is a parsing-based lexicon generation algorithm (PBLGA) and the second was to detect sarcasm based on the occurrence of the interjection word. The combination of two approaches is also shown and compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach to detect sarcasm. First approach attains a 0.89, 0.81 and 0.84 precision, recall and f -- score respectively. Second approach attains 0.85, 0.96 and 0.90 precision, recall and f -- score respectively in tweets with sarcastic hashtag.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity in using social media to collect data, there is an increasing need to discover ways in which to productively use this data. Our objective is to form an interest profile from tweets and use this to recommend loosely related Reddit threads which the reader is most likely to be interested in. The problem is approached as a genre classification problem. Given a tweet, we want to deduce what genre(s) it might fall under if those words in the tweet were used in official texts. From there, we keep track of how many tweets fall under which genre, and generate a list of Reddit threads which similarly fall under those genre and are proportional to the interests of the user. Due to the complexity of genre classification, we chose to use an ensemble approach for classification. We use three classifiers in our ensemble: 1) a classic Naive Bayesian classifier, 2) a Naive Bayesian classifier trained only on the parts-of-speech of sentences, and 3) a Naive Bayesian classifier which will only make a decision if the probability P(x) ≥ 0.9. We measured the success of our classifiers by comparing the accuracy, precision, and recall of each model. Classifiers 1 and 2 had high accuracy than classifier 3 but classifier 3 had a much higher precision and recall rate. After creating the classifier, we were then able to form an interest profile on well-known people, one who has a small number of tweets versus one with a much larger number, and compile a list of recommended articles. The genres tagged to each person seemed to match their public personas and most of the articles chosen fit these genres. Our results are a valuable beginning for what constitutes a much larger project.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the influence maximization problem in social networks. The aim is to find a subset of k -- nodes called seeds, which maximizes the influence spread. We propose a new approach based on the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) which extracts an acyclic spanning graph from the social network. The extraction method used to build the acyclic spanning graph is based on the existing centrality measures to determine the firsts nodes. We implement two extraction algorithms: SCG-algorithm for a connected graph and SDG- algorithm for a digraph. Both proposed algorithms are effective and their complexity is O(nm). So we use the same centrality measures to determine the seeds in the extracted graph. To show the pertinence of our approach, the results showed that the seeds given by the acyclic spanning graph give better results than the seeds given by the initial graph. This seeds will be determined by using the same heuristic like degree heuristic, degree discount heuristic, degree diffusion heuristic. The performances of this approach are very perceptible through the simulation carried out by the R software and the igraph package.},

Multiple linear regression is applied to analyze the influence of player's characteristics on his performance. Moreover, clustering technique is used, in particular K-means, to extract players' clusters and to identify their common characteristics. The regression models showed that the number of access to the game, completed quests and advantages used contribute significantly to the scores and the gaming duration, while the clustering revealed three forms of players' participation: beginner, intermediate and advanced; who interact with the game according to their experiences.},

abstract = {The issue of whether behavioral similarity between friends is due to peer influence, friendship selection, or both has been raised and discussed abundantly in the literature. These two opposite theoretical perspectives have their own advocates respectively to justify the casual relationship between individual action and social network structure while some studies leave this question open and apply quantitative methods on empirical data to examine either selection or influence causes similarity among group members. This study imposes two issues at least have been gotten less attention in the literature and should not be omitted. One is behavior side: only dealing with monotonic dimension of conceptualizing adolescent behavior. The other issue is network structure side: features of friendship network structure are treated as independent variables in the model to examine the relationship between individual behavior and social network. A longitudinal data was employed to observe the changes of adolescents' friendship and their behavior in a number of networks. A total of 41 classroom networks had been collected in the first grade of secondary school (2,690 students), measuring multidimensional behaviors and friendship nominations at three time points in one school year to obtain longitudinal information about behavior and network dynamics. The respondents nominated up to 3 best friends in class and answered other questions about their experiences in family and school. To model and analyze the data, a multidimensional scaling model with dynamics of friendship network is employed to obtain adolescent network similarity/dissimilarity and observe multidimensional behaviors for the joint analysis of selection-influence effects on behavioral similarity between peers.},

We assume that the broadcasts of messages in the social network is governed by a self-exciting point process, namely a Hawkes process, which takes into consideration the real broadcasting times of messages and the interaction between users and topics. We formally define trendiness and derive trend indices for each topic being disseminated in the social network. These indices take into consideration the time between the detection and the message broadcasts, the distance between the real broadcast intensity and the maximum expected broadcast intensity, and the social network topology. The proposed trend detection algorithm is simple and uses stochastic control techniques in order to calculate the trend indices. It is also fast and aggregates all the information of the broadcasts into a simple one-dimensional process, thus reducing its complexity and the quantity of data necessary to the detection.},

abstract = {Using the web for communication, purchases, searching information and/or socializing generates data, about ourselves, our connections and our activities, which is collected easily. In online social networks, users volunteer perhaps what is considered more personal information to their selected circles. But each person has personal preferences about what it considers public and what it considers private. The problem is that the information that is public may be used to disclose information that the users expect to remain confidential.This paper offers a path to provide tips and warnings to each user of an online social network so they can exercise control on the information they consider private not only by not disclosing such information, but by acting on their public information-items that could be informative for those information-items that are private. This is a significant challenge, because most web-applications use personalization to build a context and provide better services. We aim to raise awareness on privacy and to empower users, giving them the possibility to regulate the benefits of personalization with the privacy risks. In this paper we also show that information-items (like relationships) can be chosen as confidential, and that we can provide meaningful warnings on metrics of association and public attributes that are strong predictors of confidential information-items.},

We propose a function called compactness, designed to assess the quality of a solution to this problem. Our algorithm is based on a graph traversal algorithm, the LexDFS. The time complexity of our method is in O(n \texttimes{} log(n)). Experiments show that our algorithm creates highly compact clusters.},

abstract = {Text categorization is an important task with plenty of applications, ranging from sentiment analysis to automated news classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based approach for text categorization. Contrary to the traditional Bag-of-Words model for document representation, we consider a model in which each document is represented by a graph that encodes relationships between the different terms. The importance of a term to a document is indicated using graph-theoretic node centrality criteria. The proposed weighting scheme is able to meaningfully capture the relationships between the terms that co-occur in a document, creating feature vectors that can improve the categorization task. We perform experiments in well-known document collections, applying popular classification algorithms. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed graph-based weighting mechanism is able to outperform existing frequency-based term weighting criteria, under appropriate parameter setting.},

abstract = {As technological and operational security measures for the protection of information systems are being widely adopted, it is much easier for a malicious user to launch an attack on an information system's weakest link, the humans operating it. Despite the damage that these attacks can cause, they are rarely taken into account in vulnerability assessment models. These models usually focus on representing the internal states of an information system, whereas social engineering attacks often start by gathering information and building relationships with the potential victims, which tends to occur outside an information system's gates. Hence, a model assessing social engineering threats should be able to account for the different channels which could be used to approach victims (professional mail, personnel mail, on-line social networks, etc). Although security professionals might not monitor some of the channels leveraged in an attack, a comprehensive vulnerability assessment model would allow the assessment of the likelihood and cost of a successful breach and tailor a security awareness programs to avoid it. We describe in this paper a multi-layered graph-based model for social engineering vulnerability assessment. We then present case studies in which vulnerabilities in an automated social engineering attack and an automated reverse social engineering attack in addition to vulnerabilities from interactions in different social networking sites, blogs and forums are assessed using this model.},

abstract = {Online advertisements are a major source of profit and customer attraction for web-based businesses. In a successful advertisement campaign, both users and businesses can benefit, as users are expected to respond positively to special offers and recommendations of their liking and businesses are able to reach the most promising potential customers. The extraction of user preferences from content provided in social media and especially in review sites can be a valuable tool both for users and businesses.In this paper, we propose a model for the analysis of content from product review sites, which considers in tandem the aspects discussed by users and the opinions associated with each aspect. The model provides two different visualizations: one for businesses that uncovers their weak and strong points against their competitors and one for end-users who receive suggestions about products of potential interest. The former is an aggregation of aspect-based opinions provided by all users and the latter is a collaborative filtering approach, which calculates user similarity over a projection of the original bipartite graph (user-item rating graph) over a content-based clustering of users and items. The model takes advantage of the feedback users give to businesses in review sites, and employ opinion mining techniques to identify the opinions of users for specific aspects of a business. Such aspects and their polarity can be used to create user and business profiles, which can subsequently be fed in a clustering and recommendation process.We envision this model as a powerful tool for planning and executing a successful marketing campaign via online media. Finally, we demonstrate how our prototype can be used in different scenarios to assist users or business owners, using the Yelp challenge dataset.},

abstract = {Disruptive event identification is a concept that is crucial to ensuring public safety regarding large-scale events. Recent work on detecting events from social media shows that although these platforms are used for social purposes, they have been emerging as important source of information. Twitter, as a form of social media, is a popular micro-blogging web application serving hundreds of millions of users. User-generated content can be exploited as a rich source of information for identifying 'real-world' disruptive events -- events that threaten social safety and security, or could cause disruption to social order. In this paper, we present an in-depth comparison of two types of feature that could be useful for identifying disruptive events: temporal and textual features. On the basis of these features, we investigate the dynamics of event/topic identification over time. We make several interesting observations: first, disruptive events are identifiable regardless of the "influence of the user" discussing them, and over a variety of topics. Second, temporal features play a central role in event detection and hence should not be disregarded or ignored. Third, textual features can be used to improve the overall performance of the event detection. We believe that these findings provide new insights for gathering information around real-world events, in particular for detecting disruptive events.},

Attributes can indicate as interests in specific topics, like science-fiction books or romantic movies, or more in general their explicit affiliation to a group inside the network. In this paper, we analyze community structures as defined by how people are associated to third concepts like attributes. To understand the community patterns we analyze three large and one small social network datasets. Our analysis shows that, irrespective of the number of nodes for any particular interest in the network, at least 50% of the nodes are part of the same connected component in the graph induced by each interest. Another interesting result of our analysis is that the majority of sub-communities (50% or above) for any interest are separated by small hops (two to three) from each other.},

abstract = {Communities in real life are usually dynamic and community structures evolve over time. Detecting community evolution provides insight into the underlying behavior of the network. A growing body of study is devoted in studying the dynamics of communities in evolving social networks. Most of them provide an event-based framework to characterize and track the community evolution. A part of these studies take a step further and provide a predictive model of the events by exploiting community features. However, the proposed models require the community extraction and computing the community features relevant to the time point to be predicted. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for predicting events by estimating feature values related to the communities in a given network. An event-based framework is used to characterize community behavior patterns. Then, a time series ARIMA model is used to predict how particular community features will change in the following time period. Distinct time windows are examined in constituting and analyzing time series. Our proposed approach efficiently tracks similar communities and identifies events over time. Furthermore, community feature values are forecasted with an acceptable error rate. Event prediction using forecasted feature values substantially match up with actual events.},

Such datasets have been recently made available, and more and more researchers address the new questions raised by this data. A link stream is a sequence of triplets (t, u, v) indicating that an interaction occurred between u and v at time t, and as such is a natural representation of these data. We generalize the classical notion of cliques in graphs to such link streams: for a given Δ, a Δ-clique is a set of nodes and a time interval such that all pairs of nodes in this set interact at least every Δ during this time interval. We proceed to compute the maximal Δ-cliques on a real-world dataset of contact among students, and show how it can bring new interpretation to patterns of contact.},

abstract = {The temporal component of social networks is often neglected in their analysis, and statistical measures are typically performed on a "static" representation of the network. As a result, measures of importance (like betweenness centrality) cannot reveal any temporal role of the entities involved. Our goal is to start filling this limitation by proposing a form of temporal betweenness measure, and by using it to analyse a knowledge mobilization network. We show that this measure, which takes time explicitly into account, allows us to detect centrality roles that were completely hidden in the classical statistical analysis. In particular, we uncover nodes whose static centrality was considered negligible, but whose temporal role is instead important to accelerate mobilization flow in the network. We also observe the reverse behaviour by detecting nodes with high static centrality, whose role as temporal bridges is instead very low. By revealing important temporal roles, this study is a first step towards a better understanding of the impact of time in social networks, and opens the road to further investigation.},

abstract = {We study the influence diffusion problem in online social networks. Formally, given a network represented by a directed graph G = (V,E), we consider a process of influence diffusion in G that proceeds as follows: Initially only the vertices of a given S ⊆ V are influenced; subsequently, at each round, the set of influenced vertices is augmented by all the vertices in the network that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced incoming neighbors. The question is to find a small subset of vertices that can influence the whole network (target set). This is a widely studied problem that abstracts many phenomena in the social, economic, biological, and physical sciences. It is known to be hard to approximate within a factor of 2log1--ϵn, for any ϵ &gt; 0, and n = |V |.Despite the above negative result, some efficient heuristics have been recently proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a scalable, fast, and simple algorithm (MTS) for the influence diffusion problem. Experiments conducted over real-world social networks show that the proposed algorithm produces solutions that substantially outperform those obtained by previously published algorithms.Experiments also show that the performances of the analyzed algorithms (measured by the normalized target set size) correlates positively with the strength of communities of a network (measured by the network modularity). Such correlation is even stronger using the results provided by the MTS algorithm, showing that the proposed MTS algorithm better exploits situations in which the community structure of the networks allows some influence between different communities.},

abstract = {We propose a novel problem called influence maximization for unknown graphs, and propose a heuristic algorithm for the problem. Influence maximization is the problem of detecting a set of influential nodes in a social network, which represents social relationships among individuals. Influence maximization has been actively studied, and several algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The existing algorithms use the entire topological structure of a social network. In practice, however, complete knowledge of the topological structure of a social network is typically difficult to obtain. We therefore tackle an influence maximization problem for unknown graphs. As a solution for this problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm, which we call IMUG (Influence Maximization for Unknown Graphs). Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves 60--90% of the influence spread of the algorithms using the entire social network topology, even when only 1--10% of the social network topology is known. These results indicate that we can achieve a reasonable influence spread even when knowledge of the social network topology is severely limited.},

Although the diffusion of a rumor is of course a multi-dimensional process driven by sociological, economical and psychological elements, in this first step, we emphasize one main dimension of this complex phenomenon only. This dimension is the neighborhood of individuals likely to spread the information. With a confrontation of two antagonistic properties of the neighborhood that are profusion and scarcity of spreaders, we highlight specific characteristics of rumors. This study could lead to the psychological mechanism involved in the decision for a person to become or not a spreader himself/herself. In summary, we study if scarcity could be the silver bullet explaining how a rumor spreads.},

We introduce a dynamical model to describe the posting behavior of users taking into account these externalities. Our model is based on stochastic approximations and sufficient conditions are provided to ensure its convergence to a unique rest point. We provide a close form of this rest point.

abstract = {Chat-log data that contains information about sender and receiver of the statements sent around in the chat can be readily turned into a directed temporal multi-network representation. In the resulting network, the activity of a chat member can, for example, be operationalized as his degree (number of distinct interaction partners) or his strength (total number of interactions). However, the data itself contains more information that is not readily representable in the network, e.g., the total number of words used by a member or the reaction time to what the members said. As degree and strength, these values can be seen as a way to operationalize the idea of activity of a chat-log member. This paper deals with the question of how the overall activity of a member can be assessed, given multiple and probably opposing criteria by using a fuzzy operator. We then present a new way of visualizing the results and show how to apply it to the network representation of chat-log data. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be used to deal with other conflicting situations, like the different rankings produced by different centrality indices.},

Our goal in this paper is to determine the efficiency with which campaigns can succeed in an online social network, efficiency represents the ease with which a campaign can triumph over other competing campaigns in a network. We model the information diffusion using Multi-Campaign Independent Cascade Model, and by applying node coercion and link cutting as campaign limiting strategies we ascertain how efficiently a campaign can succeed. The efficiency measure tackles the problem of determining the survivability of campaigns, which is used to ensure success or failure of a campaign using campaign limiting strategies.},

abstract = {Twitter is a popular micro-blogging service where users search for timely and social information. Users post short text messages called Tweets, which are limited in length. These Tweets are different from traditional documents in its shortness and sparseness. As a result, short text tends to be ambiguous without enough contextual information. To address these issues, we propose an efficient method to enrich the tweet's representation for the Arabic language using web search engine as a large and open corpus and the Rough Set Theory which is a mathematical tool to deal with vagueness and uncertainty. To assess the performance of the proposed system, a series of experiments has been conducted. The effectiveness of our system has been evaluated and compared in terms of the F1-measure using the Na\"{\i}ve Bayesian (NB) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in our Arabic Tweets Categorization System. The obtained results show that enriching the tweet's representation increases significantly the F1-measure of the Arabic tweets categorization system.},

abstract = {Organizations measure their social audience based on the number of users, fans, and followers on social media. Every social media platform has its user identity and a single user is present across varied platforms. Due to the disconnected user profiles, identifying duplicate users across media is non-trivial. There is a need to create a complete view of a user for various applications such as targeting and user profile construction. This view is not easily available due to the individual identities. In this work, we explore the feature space across social media that can be leveraged for intelligent user identity aggregation. Further, we present a two-phased unified identity creation process using our feature analysis, unsupervised candidate selection, and supervised user matching algorithms on four different social networks.},

The participants of the study had to track members of a software development community over five periods of time in three different dynamic graph drawings. The results suggest that dynamic graph drawings making use of fixed positions are more efficient in the visual search but are limited in the recognition of single elements. On the other hand, dynamic graph drawings with the minimal changes or a constant structure improve the recognition of single elements but lose efficiency in the visual search.},

An interesting consequence of this explosive usage of social networks is that it is possible to glean the current mood and emotion of a user from his or her social network postings. A question that arises in this context is: Can we use any differentiating features exhibited by people on their online social activities to build appropriate classifiers that can identify the positivity or negativity of users with high accuracy and low false positive and negative rates?},

However, false information and rumors on social media are undermining its utility as a valuable real-time information source. Existing works for information credibility analysis are based on offline batch analysis, often incurring a long lag since the event first occurs. In this paper, we develop a generative probabilistic model for real-time event credibility prediction in Twitter. We propose an online prediction algorithm based on streaming tweets, without storing or reprocessing the past tweets. We evaluate both the offline batch prediction and online streaming prediction performance of the proposed model on the Twitter dataset. The empirical results show that its batch prediction performance outperforms other algorithms based on aggregation analysis, and the online prediction performance quickly approaches that of the batch prediction with only a few hundred tweets.},

By partitioning the whole time horizon, in which interactions are observed, we develop a non stationary extension of the SBM, allowing us to simultaneously cluster the nodes of a network and the fixed time intervals in which interactions take place. The number of clusters as well as memberships to clusters are finally obtained through the maximization of the complete-data integrated likelihood relying on a greedy search approach. Experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed methodology.},

The promising viral marketing paradigm on social network is different from the current research in two main aspects. First, instead of maximizing the message spread over the entire social network, we focus on the target market since the business vendors almost specify the target users before designing its marketing strategy. Second, the status of a user is no longer a binary indicator representing either active or inactive. In the new model the user status turns to be an integer value reflecting the amount of influences delivered to that user. In this paper, we prove the NP-hard nature of this challenging problem.},

abstract = {Opinion mining and sentiment analysis refer to the identification and the aggregation of attitudes or opinions expressed by internet users towards a specific topic. However, due to the limitation in terms of characters (i.e. 140 characters per tweet) and the use of informal language, the state-of-the-art approaches of sentiment analysis present lower performances in Twitter than that when they are applied on longer texts. Moreover, presence of sarcasm makes the task even more challenging. Sarcasm is when a person conveys implicit information, usually the opposite of what is said, within the message he transmits. In this paper we propose a method that makes use of a minimal set of features, yet, efficiently classifies tweets regardless of their topic. We also study the importance of detecting sarcastic tweets automatically, and demonstrate how the accuracy of sentiment analysis can be enhanced knowing which tweets are sarcastic and which are not.},

We propose the algorithm EMOC first finding k-connected groups from the perspective of each node and second merging them to detect overlapping communities.

Many previous works have discussed reconstructing such networks using the network topology to devise an approach that finds a substitute node for a deleted node and generates appropriate links to avoid a fragmentation of the network. A common used property in finding substitute node is centrality, but calculating some kinds of centrality may spend too much time on re-scanning the graph. Thus, we propose a local approach, CLOMADE, standing for Choosing LOcal MAximum DEgree. We only need to scan the whole graph once for calculating degree. We choose a node with local maximum degree to be the substitute node and generate new links from the substitute node to other nodes. The experiments show that CLOMADE outperforms previous works in execution time.},

In this paper, we reformulate the objective in terms of the Kullback-Leibler distance between the distribution of the random walk transitions and that of a model walk. The choice of model can be used to constrain the type of partition that the method extracts. This generalisation makes the method suitable for extracting other types of meso-structure from the network, enabling the analyst to explicitly control the type of extracted structure.},

abstract = {When a piece of information (microblog, photograph, video, link, etc.) starts to spread in a social network, an important question arises: will it spread to "viral" proportions -- where "viral" is defined as an order-of-magnitude increase. However, several previous studies have established that cascade size and frequency are related through a power-law - which leads to a severe imbalance in this classification problem. In this paper, we devise a suite of measurements based on "structural diversity" -- the variety of social contexts (communities) in which individuals partaking in a given cascade engage. We demonstrate these measures are able to distinguish viral from non-viral cascades, despite the severe imbalance of the data for this problem. Further, we leverage these measurements as features in a classification approach, successfully predicting microblogs that grow from 50 to 500 reposts with precision of 0.69 and recall of 0.52 for the viral class - despite this class comprising under 2% of samples. This significantly outperforms our baseline approach as well as the current state-of-the-art. Our work also demonstrates how we can tradeoff between precision and recall.},

abstract = {Ever since the introduction of the first epidemic model, scientists have tried extrapolating the damage caused by a contagious disease, given its spreading pattern in the premature stage. However, understanding epidemiology remains an elusive mystery to researchers specifically because of the unavailability of large amount of data. We utilise the study of diffusion of memes in a social networking website to solve this problem. In this paper, we analyse the impact of specific meso-scale properties of a network on a meme traversing over it. We have employed SCCP (Scale free, Communities, Core Periphery structure) networks for analysis purpose. We propose a new meme propagation model for real world social networks and observe the cause of virality of a meme. We have tested and validated our model with the real world information spreading pattern.},
