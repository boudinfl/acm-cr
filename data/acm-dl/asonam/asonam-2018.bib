isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Understanding overlapping community structures is crucial for network analysis and prediction. AGM (Affiliation Graph Model) is one of the favorite models for explaining the densely overlapped community structures. In this paper, we thoroughly re-investigate the assumptions made by the AGM model on real datasets. We find that the AGM model is not sufficient to explain several empirical behaviors observed in popular real-world networks. To our surprise, all our experimental results can be explained by a parameter-free hypothesis, leading to more straightforward modeling than AGM which has many parameters. Based on these findings, we propose a parameter-free Jaccard-based Affiliation Graph (JAG) model which models the probability of edge as a network specific constant times the Jaccard similarity between community sets associated with the individuals. Our modeling is significantly simpler than AGM, and it eliminates the need of associating a parameter, the probability value, with each community. Furthermore, JAG model naturally explains why (and in fact when) overlapping communities are densely connected. Based on these observations, we propose a new community-driven friendship formation process, which mathematically recovers the JAG model. JAG is the first model that points towards a direct causal relationship between tight connections in the given community with the number of overlapping communities inside it. Thus, the most effective way to bring a community together is to form more sub-communities within it. The community detection algorithm based on our modeling demonstrates a significantly simple algorithm with state-of-the-art accuracy on six real-world network datasets compared to the existing link analysis based methods.},

abstract = {In this work, we focus on the problem of local community detection with edge uncertainty. We use an estimator to cope with the intrinsic uncertainty of the problem. Then we illustrate with an example that periphery nodes tend to be grouped into their neighbor communities in uncertain networks, and we propose a new measure K to address this problem. Due to the very limited publicly available uncertain network datasets, we also put forward a way to generate uncertain networks. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using existing ground truth as well as based on common metrics to show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Metagenomics is an important field in biology where an environmental sample is sequenced to study the genomic content of species present in it. The data obtained from sequencing is a mixture of DNA fragments obtained from several species present in the sample. So an important step in this data analysis is to group together the DNA fragments originating from same specie or genera. In this paper we present an approach named ProxiClust, where we exhibit how Community Detection methods can be used to handle this task. The large size of the dataset poses challenge in using the traditional data mining technique given their computation and memory complexity. We aim to achieve scalability through a deterministic approach by converting the data from cloud points in to a graph and leverage community detection on it for identifying groups. Firstly the relevant pair-wise relationships between DNA fragments are extracted by building proximity graphs on the data so storing complete distance matrix in memory can be avoided. The groups on graph are identified by leveraging community detection methods. We perform exploratory study to examine properties of several approaches for this framework and exhibit specific instances of this approach that perform comparably with state of the art binning methods.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Microblogging social media (mainly represented by Twitter) focuses on fast open real-time communication using short messages between users and their followers. These platforms generate large amounts of content and community finding techniques are an attractive alternative for organising it. However there is no clear agreement in the literature for a definition of user community for the microblogging use case, leading to unreliable ground-truth data and evaluation. In this work, we differentiate between functional and structural definitions of communities for microblogging. A functional community groups its users by a common independent social function, e.g. fans of the same football team, while in a structural community the members exclusively depend on their connectivity in a network, e.g. modularity. We build and characterise eight types of functional communities to be used as user-labelled ground-truth and five types of live user interactions networks from Twitter. We then evaluate thirteen popular structural community definitions using five different Twitter datasets, exploring their goodness and robustness for detecting the functional ground-truth under different perturbation strategies. Our results show that definitions based on internal connectivity, e.g. Triangle Participation Ratio, Fraction Over Median Degree or Conductance work best for the Twitter use case and are very robust. On the other hand, classic scores such as Modularity are limited and do not fit very well due to the sparsity and noise of microblogging.},

abstract = {The Jordan center of a graph is defined as a vertex whose maximum distance to other nodes in the graph is minimal, and it finds applications in facility location and source detection problems. We study properties of the Jordan center in the case of random growing trees. In particular, we consider a regular tree graph on which an infection starts from a root node and then spreads along the edges of the graph according to various random spread models. For the Independent Cascade (IC) model and the discrete Susceptible Infected (SI) model, both of which are discrete time models, we show that as the infected subgraph grows with time, the Jordan center persists on a single vertex after a finite number of timesteps.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Some of the well known streaming algorithms to estimate number of triangles in a graph stream work as follows: Sample a single triangle with high enough probability and repeat this basic step to obtain a global triangle count. For example, the algorithm due to Buriol et al. (PODS 2006) uniformly at random picks a single vertex v and a single edge e and checks whether the two cross edges that connect v to e appear in the stream. Similarly, the neighborhood sampling algorithm (PVLDB 2013) attempts to sample a triangle by randomly choosing a single vertex v, a single neighbor u of v and waits for a third edge that completes the triangle. In both the algorithms, the basic sampling step is repeated multiple times to obtain an estimate for the global triangle count in the input graph stream.In this work, we propose a multi-sampling variant of these algorithms: In case of Buriol et al's algorithm, instead of randomly choosing a single vertex and edge, randomly sample multiple vertices and multiple edges and collect cross edges that connect sampled vertices to the sampled edges. In case of neighborhood sampling algorithm, randomly pick multiple edges and pick multiple neighbors of them. We provide a theoretical analysis of these algorithms and prove that these new algorithms improve upon the known space and accuracy bounds. We experimentally show that these algorithms out-perform well known triangle counting streaming algorithms.},

abstract = {Modern-day social networks evolve over time, that is, new contacts appear and old contacts may disappear. They can be modeled as temporal graphs where interactions between vertices (people) are represented by time-stamped edges. One of the most fundamental problems in social network analysis is community detection and within community detection, one of the most basic primitives to model a community is a clique. Addressing the problem of finding communities in temporal networks, Viard et al. [TCS 2016] introduced Δ-cliques as a natural temporal version of cliques. Himmel et al. [SNAM 2017] showed how to adapt the well-known Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for listing static cliques to listing Δ-cliques. We continue this work and improve and extend this algorithm to list temporal k-plexes, a temporal version of k-plexes, which are one of many popular clique relaxations.We define a Δ-k-plex as a set of vertices with a lifetime, where during the lifetime each vertex has an edge to all but at most k-1 vertices at least once every Δ+1 consecutive time steps. We develop an algorithm for listing all maximal Δ-k-plexes and perform experiments on real-world networks that demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach. In particular, for the special case of listing Δ-1-plexes (Δ-cliques), we observe that our algorithm is significantly faster than the previous algorithm by Himmel et al.},

isbn = {9781538660515},

abstract = {Networks or graphs provide a natural and generic way for modeling rich structured data. Recent research on graph analysis has been focused on representation learning, of which the goal is to encode the network structures into distributed embedding vectors, so as to enable various downstream applications through off-the-shelf machine learning. However, existing methods mostly focus on node-level embedding, which is insufficient for subgraph analysis. Moreover, their leverage of network structures through path sampling or neighborhood preserving is implicit and coarse. Network motifs allow graph analysis in a finer granularity, but existing methods based on motif matching are limited to enumerated simple motifs and do not leverage node labels and supervision. In this paper, we develop NEST, a novel hierarchical network embedding method combining motif filtering and convolutional neural networks. Motif-based filtering enables NEST to capture exact small structures within networks, and convolution over the filtered embedding allows it to fully explore complex substructures and their combinations. NEST can be trivially applied to any domain and provide insight into particular network functional blocks. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction, drug toxicity prediction and social network community identification have demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Cyberbullying is a serious threat to both the short and long-term well-being of social media users. Addressing this problem in online environments demands the ability to automatically detect cyberbullying and to identify the roles that participants assume in social interactions. As cyberbullying occurs within online communities, it is also vital to understand the group dynamics that support bullying behavior. To this end, we propose a socio-linguistic model which jointly detects cyberbullying content in messages, discovers latent text categories, identifies participant roles and exploits social interactions. While our method makes use of content that is labeled as bullying, it does not require category, role or relationship labels. Furthermore, as bullying labels are often subjective, noisy and inconsistent, an important contribution of our paper is effective methods for leveraging inconsistent labels. Rather than discard inconsistent labels, we evaluate different methods for learning from them, demonstrating that incorporating uncertainty allows for better generalization. Our proposed socio-linguistic model achieves an 18% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.},

A trust model is proposed that utilizes the metadata of researchers and their papers, extracted from academic social networks, in order to produce two trust values, one for a researcher and another for a scientific paper. The utilized metadata for the researchers includes (total publication, total work citation, followers, h-index). Propagation of trust score using top co-authors is also considered for authors. The metadata of papers are: calculated author score, paper citation, and references citation. Each of those individual factors is assigned a specific weight based on user preference and AHP ranking method is applied. Individual metadata are aggregated to a collective one by considering aggregation weights for each feature and applying AHP ranking method. Experimental show that the proposed model provide a high accuracy value when compared using ground truth data from Google Scholar and global H-index.},

abstract = {Religious hate speech in the Arabic Twittersphere is a notable problem that requires developing automated tools to detect messages that use inflammatory sectarian language to promote hatred and violence against people on the basis of religious affiliation. Distinguishing hate speech from other profane and vulgar language is quite a challenging task that requires deep linguistic analysis. The richness of the Arabic morphology and the limited available resources for the Arabic language make this task even more challenging. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of identifying speech promoting religious hatred in the Arabic Twitter. In this work, we describe how we created the first publicly available Arabic dataset annotated for the task of religious hate speech detection and the first Arabic lexicon consisting of terms commonly found in religious discussions along with scores representing their polarity and strength. We then developed various classification models using lexicon-based, n-gram-based, and deep-learning-based approaches. A detailed comparison of the performance of different models on a completely new unseen dataset is then presented. We find that a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and pre-trained word embeddings can adequately detect religious hate speech with 0.84 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).},

abstract = {Interventions to reduce violence among homeless youth are difficult to implement due to the complex nature of violence. However, a peer-based intervention approach would likely be a worthy approach as it has been shown that individuals who interact with more violent individuals are more likely to be violent, suggesting a contagious nature of violence. We propose Uncertain Voter Model to represent the complex process of diffusion of violence over a social network, that captures uncertainties in links and time over which the diffusion of violence takes place. Assuming this model, we define Violence Minimization problem where the task is to select a predefined number of individuals for intervention so that the expected number of violent individuals in the network is minimized over a given time-frame. We extend the problem to a probabilistic setting, where the success probability of converting an individual into non-violent is a function of the number of "units" of intervention performed on them. We provide algorithms for finding the optimal intervention strategies for both scenarios. We demonstrate that our algorithms perform significantly better than interventions based on popular centrality measures in terms of reducing violence.},

abstract = {The task of points-of-interest (POI) recommendations has become an essential feature in location-based social networks (LBSNs) with the significant growth of shared data on LBSNs. However it remains a challenging problem, because the decision process of a user choosing to visit a POI depends on numerous factors. The high level of sparsity of the data in LBSNs makes the POI recommendation problem even more challenging, especially for large geographical areas and worldwide datasets. Moreover, in this context the mobility behavior of the users is very heterogeneous, ranging from urban to worldwide mobility.In this paper, we explore the impact of spatial clustering on the recommendation quality. The proposed approach combines spatial clustering with users' influences. It is based on a Poisson factorization model built on an implicit social network, inferred from the geographical mobility patterns. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of our approach on the YFCC dataset (a very large-scale real-world dataset). The experiments show that our approach achieves a significantly superior recommendation quality compared to other state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.},

abstract = {Community detection on social media has attracted considerable attention for many years. However, existing methods do not reveal the relations between communities. Communities can form alliances or engage in antagonisms due to various factors, e.g., shared or conflicting goals and values. Uncovering such relations can provide better insights to understand communities and the structure of social media. According to social science findings, the attitudes that members from different communities express towards each other are largely shaped by their community membership. Hence, we hypothesize that inter-community attitudes expressed among users in social media have the potential to reflect their inter-community relations. Therefore, we first validate this hypothesis in the context of social media. Then, inspired by the hypothesis, we develop a framework to detect communities and their relations by jointly modeling users' attitudes and social interactions. We present experimental results using three real-world social media datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.},

abstract = {The identification of critical nodes in a graph is a fundamental task in network analysis. Centrality measures are commonly used for this purpose. These methods rely on two assumptions that restrict their applicability. First, they only depend on the topology of the network and do not consider the activity over the network. Second, they assume the entire network is available. However, in many applications, it is the underlying activity of the network such as interactions and communications that makes a node critical, and it is hard to collect the entire network topology, when the network is vast and autonomous.We propose a new measure, Active Betweenness Cardinality, where the importance of the nodes are based not on the static structure, but the active utilization of the network. We show how this metric can be computed efficiently by only local information for a given node and how we can locate the critical nodes by using only a few nodes. We also show how this metric can be used to monitor a network and identify node failures. We evaluate our metric and algorithms on real-world networks and show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The public expects a prompt response from emergency services to address requests for help posted on social media. However, the information overload of social media experienced by these organizations, coupled with their limited human resources, challenges them to timely identify and prioritize critical requests. This is particularly acute in crisis situations where any delay may have a severe impact on the effectiveness of the response. While social media has been extensively studied during crises, there is limited work on formally characterizing serviceable help requests and automatically prioritizing them for a timely response.In this paper, we present a formal model of serviceability called Social-EOC (Social Emergency Operations Center), which describes the elements of a serviceable message posted in social media that can be expressed as a request. We also describe a system for the discovery and ranking of highly serviceable requests, based on the proposed serviceability model. We validate the model for emergency services, by performing an evaluation based on real-world data from six crises, with ground truth provided by emergency management practitioners. Our experiments demonstrate that features based on the serviceability model improve the performance of discovering and ranking (nDCG up to 25%) service requests over different baselines. In the light of these experiments, the application of the serviceability model could reduce the cognitive load on emergency operation center personnel, in filtering and ranking public requests at scale.},

abstract = {Most of traditional recommender systems perform well only when sufficient user-item interactions, such as purchase records or ratings, have been obtained in advance, while suffering from poor performance in the scenario of sparse interactions. Addressing this problem, we propose a neural network based recommendation framework which is fed with user/item's original tags as well as the expanded tags from social context. Through embedding the latent correlations between tags into distributed feature representations, our model uncovers the implicit relationships between users and items sufficiently, exhibiting superior performance no matter whether sufficient user-item interactions are available or not. Furthermore, our framework can be further tailored for link prediction in networks, since recommending an item to a user can be recognized as predicting a link between them. The extensive experiments on two real recommendation tasks, i.e., Weibo followship recommendation and Douban movie recommendation, justify our framework's superiority to the state-of-the-art methods.},

It uses a combination of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework and Page-Hinkley (PH) test to personalize the general song map for each mood according to user implicit reward. We conduct a series of tests using LiveJournal two-million (LJ2M) dataset to show the effect of mood in music recommendation and how the proposed solution can improve the performance of music recommendation over time compared to other conventional solutions in terms of hit rate and F1 score.},

abstract = {Mobile Applications (or Apps) are becoming more and more popular in recent years, which has attracted increasing attention on mobile App recommendations. The majority of existing App recommendation algorithms focus on mining App functionality or user usage data for discovering user preferences; while actions taken by a user when he/she decides to download an App or not are ignored. In realistic scenarios, a user will first view the description of the App and then decide if he/she wants to download it or not. The actions such as viewing or downloading provide rich information about users' preferences and tastes for Apps, which have great potentials to advance App recommendations. However, the work on exploring action data for App recommendations is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper we study the novel problem of exploiting user actions for App recommendations. We propose a new framework ActionRank, which simultaneously captures various signals from user actions for App recommendations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social media sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm to collect observations from online social media users about the physical environment. A fundamental problem in social media sensing applications lies in estimating the evolving truth of the measured variables and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori. This problem is referred to as dynamic truth discovery. Two major limitations exist in current truth discovery solutions: i) existing solutions cannot effectively address the missing truth problem where the measured variables do not have any reported measurements from the data sources; ii) the latent correlations among the measured variables were not fully captured and utilized in current solutions. In this paper, we proposed a Reliable Missing Truth Finder (RMTF) to address the above limitations in social media sensing applications. In particular, we develop a novel data-driven technique to identify the lagged and latent correlations among measured variables, and incorporate such correlation information into a holistic spatiotemporal inference model to infer the missing truth. We evaluated the RMTF using the real-world Twitter data feeds. The results show that the RMTF scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions by correctly inferring the missing truth of the measured variables.},

abstract = {Text-based media possess a wealth of insights that can be mined to understand perceptions and actions. Researchers and public officials can use these data to inform development policy and humanitarian action. An important step in analyzing text-based databases, such as social media, is the creation of taxonomies which are used to filter information relevant to topics of interest. We worked with thousands of online volunteers to translate 2,137 keywords or phrases in English to formal or vernacular expressions in 29 different languages with the aim of understanding human responses to natural disasters, as well as developing sets of corpus on non popular languages (non English and non EU languages) which still has limited studies. In processing the data set, we faced a challenge in selecting a set of quality translations for each language. This paper aims to estimate the quality of the crowdsourced translations by non-professional translators. This paper presents an extensive empirical study using 91 features from 29 languages corpora to describe (a) translators, (b) source expressions, and (c) translated expressions. Our results show that our approach exploring two regression models and two supervised learning methods produces better results than a baseline approach with a commonly used metric, namely peer-review scores.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, online social networks have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers. However, before one can gain insight into the behavior or structure of a network, one must first collect appropriate data. Data collection poses several challenges, such as API or bandwidth limits, which require the data collector to carefully consider which queries to make. Many network crawling methods have been proposed; however, their performance depends on network structure. In particular, our previous work in [1] has shown that existing algorithms tend to either (1) Do well at exploring dense areas of a network, but have difficulty in transitioning to new areas of the network, or (2) Easily move between network regions, but fail to fully explore each region. In this work, we introduce DE-Crawler, a novel network crawler that attempts to capture the best of both worlds. DE-Crawler consists of two main stages: Densification, in which the crawler aims to find as many nodes as possible in the current dense region (or community), and Expansion, in which the crawler tries to escape from its current region and move to another dense region. We show that DE-Crawler performs well across networks with different structural properties, outperforming baseline algorithms by up to 28%.},

abstract = {This work presents an in-depth forensic analysis of a large-scale spam attack launched by one of the largest Twitter botnets reported in academic literature. The Bursty botnet contains over 500,000; many of which have not been suspended. The bots have generated over 2.8 million spam tweets, with 2.2 million mentions directly targeting over 1.3 million distinct Twitter users. We reveal that the botnet used a network of URL shortening services and redirections to obfuscate the real landing pages. We show that users clicked on these URLs shortly after they were published and in large numbers. We even discovered the botmaster who was behind the whole operation, including creation of the Bursty botnet and registration of the several landing pages, which happen to be phishing websites. Furthermore, we found that this botmaster is still active selling Twitter bot related services. Our work reconstructs the complete course of the spam attacks, from planning to execution. This work provides in depth analysis and insight into the operation of cybercriminals on Twitter, and the cyberspace infrastructure and black-markets that they rely on. Finally, we address how the state-of-the-art bot classifiers are unable differentiate the Bursty bots from normal users, highlighting the need and importance of individual botnet analysis.},

More surprisingly, we show that bots are more structured in their posting behaviors compared to humans by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).More precisely, we demonstrate using Class Activation Maps that bots contain less entropy than humans. Thus, we conclude that bots are more amenable to generic models than humans. We evaluate the hypothesis on more than 32 million posts from 12 thousand Twitter users with 97% accuracy.},

Many tobacco users discuss their opinions, habits and preferences on social media. This work conceptualizes a framework for targeted health interventions to inform tobacco users about the consequences of tobacco use. We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting pro-tobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets. Algorithmic matching, leveraging the power of peer influence, allows for the systematic delivery of personalized interventions based on real anti-tobacco tweets from former smokers. Experimental evaluation suggested that our system would perform well if deployed.},

Our analysis is compared with the state of the art of this kind and reveals that the chat functionally was able to improve Klout and follow ratio on about 24% and 123% respectively. Also, the advanced communications skills contribute to more message interactions between socialbots and other accounts.

Such information includes text (e.g., tweets) or images posted by eyewitnesses of a disaster. Most of the existing research explores the use of text in identifying situational awareness information useful for disaster response teams. The use of social media images to assess disaster damage is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on convolutional neural networks and class activation maps, to locate damage in a disaster image and to quantify the degree of the damage. Our proposed approach enables the use of social network images for post-disaster damage assessment, and provides an inexpensive and feasible alternative to the more expensive GIS approach.},

Identifying such tweets would not only provide a holistic view of the affected areas but would also help in taking necessary relief actions. Existing works on this topic fail to effectively capture the semantic variation in the tweets, possibly due to poor content quality, thereby providing scopes for further improvement in the mechanisms involved. Our proposed technique relies on a novel split-query based mechanism along with a pseudo-relevance feedback approach to identify the relevant tweets. The pseudo-relevance feedback approach expands on an initial set of seed tweets obtained using a semi-automatic query generation mechanism that couples topic based clustering with human annotation. Empirical validation of our proposed method on a manually annotated ground truth data reveals a considerable improvement in precision, recall and mean average precision over several baseline methods.},

What we see is just the tip of the iceberg, the by-product of a series of information battles where people fight for various social reasons, including bias and commercial interests. This building process has so far remained hidden, whereas it is an essential component of the overall information, showing how much a topic is stable or is instead controversial. In this paper we briefly introduce Negapedia, a project that for the first time aims to show to the general public this so far missing "negative" side of Wikipedia. The goal of the system, besides its research interest, is to increase the level of awareness of the public, showing the world of controversies beneath each argument, and also providing panoramic and historical views of the information battles that shape the information present in Wikipedia.},

For both indicators of team and individual diversity we propose a model-based normalization in which we compare observed values to expected values in a random graph model that preserves expected degrees of users and articles. Using data on all articles in the English-language edition of Wikipedia, we show that diverse teams tend to write high-quality articles, but articles written by teams containing jack of all trades contributors tend to be of lower quality. These findings are robust to several alternative explanations for article quality. We also show that the proposed model-based normalization of network indicators outperforms an ad-hoc normalization via cosine similarity.},

To apply advanced machine learning algorithms to network data, low-dimensional and continuous representations are desired. To achieve this goal, many network embedding methods have been proposed recently. The majority of existing methods facilitate the local information i.e. local connections between nodes, to learn the representations, while neglecting global information (or node status), which has been proven to boost numerous network mining tasks such as link prediction and social recommendation. In this paper, we study the problem of preserving local and global information for network embedding. In particular, we introduce an approach to capture global information and propose a network embedding framework LOG, which can coherently model LOcal and Global information. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

isbn = {9781538660515},

abstract = {We propose a new model for the study of resilience of coevolving multiplex scale-free networks. Our network model, called preferential interdependent networks, is a novel continuum over scale-free networks parameterized by their correlation ρ, 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1. Our failure and recovery model ties the propensity of a node, both to fail and to assist in recovery, to its importance. We show, analytically, that our network model can achieve any γ, 2 ≤ γ ≤ 3 for the exponent of the power law of the degree distribution; this is superior to existing multiplex models and allows us better fidelity in representing real-world networks. Our failure and recovery model is also a departure from the much studied cascading error model based on the giant component; it allows for surviving important nodes to send assistance to the damaged nodes to enable their recovery. This better reflects the reality of recovery in man-made networks such as social networks and infrastructure networks.Our main finding, based on simulations, is that resilient preferential interdependent networks are those in which the layers are neither completely correlated (ρ = 1) nor completely uncorrelated (ρ = 0) but instead semi-correlated (ρ ≈ 0.1 -- 0.3). This finding is consistent with the real-world experience where complex man-made networks typically bounce back quickly from stress. In an attempt to explain our intriguing empirical discovery we present an argument for why semi-correlated multiplex networks can be the most resilient. Our argument can be seen as an explanation of plausibility or as an incomplete mathematical proof subject to certain technical conjectures that we make explicit.},

isbn = {9781538660515},

abstract = {The most-followed Twitter users and their pairwise relationships form a sub-graph of all Twitter users that we call the Twitter elite network. The connectivity patterns and influence (in terms of reply and retweet activity) among these elite users illustrate how the "important" users connect and interact with one another on Twitter. Such an elite-focused view also provides valuable information about the structure of the Twitter network as a whole.This paper presents the first detailed characterization of the top-10K Twitter elite network. We describe a new technique to efficiently and accurately capture the Twitter elite network along with social attributes of individual elite accounts. We show that a sufficiently large elite network is typically composed of 15--20 resilient and socially cohesive communities representing "socially meaningful" components of the elite network. We then characterize the community-level structure of the elite network in terms of bias in directed pairwise connectivity and relative reachability. We demonstrate that both the retweet and reply activity between elite users are effectively contained within individual elite communities. Finally, we illustrate that a majority of the elite friends of regular Twitter users tend to belong to a single elite community. This finding offers a promising criterion to group regular users into "shadow partitions" based on their association with elite communities. We show that the level of overall inter-connectivity between shadow partitions mirrors the inter-connectivity of the elite communities. This suggests that these shadow partitions can be viewed as extensions of their corresponding elite communities.},

Since social reputation/impact of users/tweets influences many decisions (such as promoting brands, advertisement etc.), several blackmarket syndicates have actively been engaged in producing fake retweets in a collusive manner. Users who want to boost the impact of their tweets approach the blackmarket services, and gain retweets for their own tweets by retweeting other customers' tweets. Thus they become customers of blackmarket syndicates and engage in fake activities. Interestingly, these customers are neither bots, nor even fake users - they are usually normal human beings; they express a mix of organic and inorganic retweeting activities, and there is no synchronicity across their behaviors.In this paper, we make a first attempt to investigate such blackmarket customers engaged in producing fake retweets. We collected and annotated a novel dataset comprising of customers of many blackmarket services and characterize them using a set of 64 novel features. We show how their social behavior differs from genuine users. We then use state-of-the-art supervised models to detect three types of customers (bots, promotional, normal) and genuine users. We achieve a Macro F1-score of 0.87 with SVM, outperforming four other baselines significantly. We further design a browser extension, SCoRe which, given the link of a tweet, spots its fake retweeters in real-time. We also collected users' feedback on the performance of SCoRe and obtained 85% accuracy.},

We further examined the Twitter networks for Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, and Paul Ryan, for 9 weeks around the 2016 election (4 weeks prior to the election and 4 weeks post-election). By carefully accounting for the observed heterogeneity in the Twitter activity levels across individuals under the null hypothesis of apathetic retweeting that is formalized as a random network model based on the directed, multi-edged, self-looped, configuration model, our data revealed via a generalized Fisher's exact test that there were significantly many Twitter accounts linked to SPLC-defined hate groups belonging to seven ideologies (Anti-Government, Anti-Immigrant, Anti-LGBT, Anti-Muslim, Alt-Right, Neo-Nazi, and White-Nationalist) and also to @realDonaldTrump relative to the accounts of the other four politicians. The exact hypothesis test uses Apache Spark's distributed sort and join algorithms to produce independent samples in a fully scalable way from the null model.},

abstract = {Delay discounting, a behavioral measure of impulsivity, is often used to quantify the human tendency to choose a smaller, sooner reward (e.g., $1 today) over a larger, later reward ($2 tomorrow). Delay discounting and its relation to human decision making is a hot topic in economics and behavior science since pitting the demands of long-term goals against short-term desires is among the most difficult tasks in human decision making. Previously, small-scale studies based on questionnaires were used to analyze an individual's delay discounting rate (DDR) and its relation to his/her real-world behavior such as substance abuse, pathological gambling and poor academic performance. In this research, we employ large-scale social media analytics to study DDR and its relation to people's social media behavior (e.g., their Likes on Facebook). We also build computational models to automatically infer DDR from Social Media Likes. Since the predicting feature space is very large and the size of the delay discounting ground truth dataset is relatively small, we focus on studying the impact of different unsupervised feature learning methods on predicting performance. Our results demonstrate the significant role unsupervised feature learning plays in this task.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Until recently, social media was seen to promote democratic discourse on social and political issues. However, this powerful communication platform has come under scrutiny for allowing hostile actors to exploit online discussions in an attempt to manipulate public opinion. A case in point is the ongoing U.S. Congress investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, with Russia accused of, among other things, using trolls (malicious accounts created for the purpose of manipulation) and bots (automated accounts) to spread misinformation and politically biased information. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation campaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation. We collected a dataset with over 43 million elections-related posts shared on Twitter between September 16 and November 9, 2016 by about 5.7 million distinct users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the identified Russian trolls. We use label propagation to infer the users' ideology based on the news sources they shared, to classify a large number of them as liberal or conservative with precision and recall above 90%. Conservatives retweeted Russian trolls significantly more often than liberals and produced 36 times more tweets. Additionally, most of the troll content originated in, and was shared by users from Southern states. Using state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimated that about 4.9% and 6.2% of liberal and conservative users respectively were bots. Text analysis on the content shared by trolls reveals that they had a mostly conservative, pro-Trump agenda. Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, it was mainly conservatives who helped amplify their message.},

abstract = {While online social networks (OSNs) have become an important platform for information exchange, the abuse of OSNs to spread misinformation has become a significant threat to our society. To restrain the propagation of misinformation in its early stages, we study the Distance-constrained Misinformation Combat under Uncertainty problem, which aims to both reduce the spread of misinformation and enhance the spread of correct information within a given propagation distance. The problem formulation considers the competitive diffusion of misinformation and correct information. It also accounts for the uncertainty in identifying initial misinformation adopters. For competitive propagation with major-threshold activation, we propose a solution based on stochastic programming and provide an upper-bound in the presence of uncertainty. We propose an efficient Combat Seed Selection algorithm to tackle general-threshold activation, in which we define a measure, "effectiveness", to evaluate the contribution of nodes to the fight against misinformation. Through extensive experiments, we validate that our algorithm outputs high-quality solution with very fast computation.},

abstract = {The problem of automatic detection of fake news in social media, e.g., on Twitter, has recently drawn some attention. Although, from a technical perspective, it can be regarded as a straight-forward, binary classification problem, the major challenge is the collection of large enough training corpora, since manual annotation of tweets as fake or non-fake news is an expensive and tedious endeavor. In this paper, we discuss a weakly supervised approach, which automatically collects a large-scale, but very noisy training dataset comprising hundreds of thousands of tweets. During collection, we automatically label tweets by their source, i.e., trustworthy or untrustworthy source, and train a classifier on this dataset. We then use that classifier for a different classification target, i.e., the classification of fake and non-fake tweets. Although the labels are not accurate according to the new classification target (not all tweets by an untrustworthy source need to be fake news, and vice versa), we show that despite this unclean inaccurate dataset, it is possible to detect fake news with an F1 score of up to 0.9.},

abstract = {Random graph models are important constructs for data analytic applications as well as pure mathematical developments, as they provide capabilities for network synthesis and principled analysis. Several models have been developed with the aim of faithfully preserving important graph metrics and substructures. With the goal of capturing degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and communities in a single random graph model, we propose a new model to address shortcomings in a progression of network modeling capabilities. The Block Two-Level Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (BTER) model of Seshadhri et al., designed to allow prescription of expected degree and clustering coefficient distributions, neglects community modeling, while the Generalized BTER (GBTER) model of Bridges et al., designed to add community modeling capabilities to BTER, struggles to faithfully represent all three characteristics simultaneously. In this work, we fit BTER and two GBTER configurations to several real-world networks and compare the results with that of our new model, the Extended GBTER (EGBTER) model. Our results support that EBGTER adds a community-modeling flexibility to BTER, while retaining a satisfactory level of accuracy in terms of degree and clustering coefficient. Our insights and empirical testing of previous models as well as the new model are novel contributions to the literature.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social network data are complex and dependent data. At the macro-level, social networks often exhibit clustering in the sense that social networks consist of communities; and at the micro-level, social networks often exhibit complex network features such as transitivity within communities. Modeling real-world social networks requires modeling both the macro- and micro-level, but many existing models focus on one of them while neglecting the other. In recent work, [28] introduced a class of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) capturing community structure as well as micro-level features within communities. While attractive, existing approaches to estimating ERGMs with community structure are not scalable. We propose here a scalable two-stage strategy to estimate an important class of ERGMs with community structure, which induces transitivity within communities. At the first stage, we use an approximate model, called working model, to estimate the community structure. At the second stage, we use ERGMs with geometrically weighted dyadwise and edgewise shared partner terms to capture refined forms of transitivity within communities. We use simulations to demonstrate the performance of the two-stage strategy in terms of the estimated community structure. In addition, we show that the estimated ERGMs with geometrically weighted dyadwise and edgewise shared partner terms within communities outperform the working model in terms of goodness-of-fit. Last, but not least, we present an application to high-resolution human contact network data.},

The analysis is applied to the 105th through 113th congressional sessions of the House of Representatives. We find that the Republican party not only generally exhibits stronger intra-party cohesion, but when voting patterns are broken out by topic, the party has a higher and more consistent cohesion factor compared to the Democratic Party.},

abstract = {Authenticity and reliability of the information spread over the cyberspace is becoming increasingly important. This is especially important in e-commerce since potential customers check reviews and customer feedbacks online before making a purchasing decision. Although this information is easily accessible through related websites, lack of verification of the authenticity of these reviews raises concerns about their reliability. Besides, fraudulent users disseminate misinformation to deceive people into acting against their interest. So, detection of fake and unreliable reviews is a crucial problem that must be addressed by the security researchers.Here we propose a spam review detection framework that incorporates knowledge extracted from the textual content of the reviews with information obtained by exploiting the underlying reviewer-product network structure. In the proposed framework, first, feature vectors are learned for each review, reviewer and product by utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms developed for learning document and node embeddings, and then these are fed into a classifier to identify opinion spam.The effectiveness of our framework over existing techniques on detecting spam reviews is demonstrated in three different data sets containing online reviews. The experimental results obtained confirm that combining representations learned from reviewer-product network and textual review data significantly improves the detection of spam reviews.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social media, e.g. Twitter, has become a widely used medium for the exchange of information, but it has also become a valuable tool for hackers to spread misinformation through compromised accounts. Hence, detecting compromised accounts is a necessary step toward a safe and secure social media environment. Nevertheless, detecting compromised accounts faces several challenges. First, social media activities of users are temporally correlated which plays an important role in compromised account detection. Second, data associated with social media accounts is inherently sparse. Finally, social contagions where multiple accounts become compromised, take advantage of the user connectivity to propagate their attack. Thus how to represent each user's network features for compromised account detection is an additional challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an End-to-End Compromised Account Detection framework (E2ECAD). E2ECAD effectively captures temporal correlations via an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. Further, it addresses the sparsity problem by defining and employing a user context representation. Meanwhile, informative network-related features are modeled efficiently. To verify the working of the framework, we construct a real-world dataset of compromised accounts on Twitter and conduct extensive experiments. The results of experiments show that E2ECAD outperforms the state of the art compromised account detection algorithms.},

abstract = {Fake news may be intentionally created to promote economic, political and social interests, and can lead to negative impacts on humans beliefs and decisions. Hence, detection of fake news is an emerging problem that has become extremely prevalent during the last few years. Most existing works on this topic focus on manual feature extraction and supervised classification models leveraging a large number of labeled (fake or real) articles. In contrast, we focus on content-based detection of fake news articles, while assuming that we have a small amount of labels, made available by manual fact-checkers or automated sources. We argue this is a more realistic setting in the presence of massive amounts of content, most of which cannot be easily fact-checked. So, we represent collections of news articles as multi-dimensional tensors, leverage tensor decomposition to derive concise article embeddings that capture spatial/contextual information about each news article, and use those embeddings to create an article-by-article graph on which we propagate limited labels. Results on real-world datasets show that our method performs on par or better than existing fully supervised models, in that we achieve better detection accuracy using fewer labels. In particular, our proposed method achieves 75.43% of accuracy using only 30% of labels of a public dataset while an SVM-based classifier achieved 67.43%. Furthermore, our method achieves 70.92% of accuracy in a large dataset using only 2% of labels.},

This process is referred to as implicit entity linking. Unlike prior work that build a representation for each entity based on its related content in the knowledge base, we propose to perform implicit entity linking by determining how a tweet is related to user-generated content posted online and as such indirectly perform entity linking. We formulate this problem as an ad-hoc document retrieval process where the input query is the tweet, which needs to be implicitly linked and the document space is the set of user-generated content related to the entities of the knowledge base. We systematically compare our work with the state-of-the-art baseline and show that our method is able to provide statistically significant improvements.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {During the past few years, sellers have increasingly offered discounted or free products to selected reviewers of e-commerce platforms in exchange for their reviews. Such incentivized (and often very positive) reviews can improve the rating of a product which in turn sways other users' opinions about the product. Despite their importance, the prevalence, characteristics, and the influence of incentivized reviews in a major e-commerce platform have not been systematically and quantitatively studied.This paper examines the problem of detecting and characterizing incentivized reviews in two primary categories of Amazon products. We describe a new method to identify Explicitly Incentivized Reviews (EIRs) and then collect a few datasets to capture an extensive collection of EIRs along with their associated products and reviewers. We show that the key features of EIRs and normal reviews exhibit different characteristics. Furthermore, we illustrate how the prevalence of EIRs has evolved and been affected by Amazon's ban. Our examination of the temporal pattern of submitted reviews for sample products reveals promotional campaigns by the corresponding sellers and their effectiveness in attracting other users. Finally, we demonstrate that a classifier that is trained by EIRs (without explicit keywords) and normal reviews can accurately detect other EIRs as well as implicitly incentivized reviews. Overall, this analysis sheds an insightful light on the impact of EIRs on Amazon products and users.},

abstract = {Helpful reviews play a pivotal role in recommending desirable goods and accelerating purchase decisions of customers in e-commercial services. Given a large proportion of product reviews with unknown helpfulness/unhelpfulness, the research on automatic identification of helpful reviews has drawn much attention in recent years. However, state-of-the-art approaches still rely heavily on extracting heuristic text features from reviews with domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we first introduce a multi-task neural learning (MTNL) architecture for identifying helpful reviews. The end-to-end neural architecture can learn to reconstruct effective features upon the raw input of words and even characters, and the multi-task learning paradigm helps to make more accurate predictions of helpful reviews based on a secondary task which fits the star ratings of reviews. We also build two datasets containing helpful/unhelpful reviews from different product categories in Amazon, and compare the performance of MTNL with several mainstream methods on both datasets. Experimental results confirm that MTNL outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.},

Specifically, a typology of contradictions was proposed, and then the state-of-art deep learning models were adopted and enhanced by three methods of incorporating sentiment analysis. The enhanced models were evaluated with Amazon's customer reviews. The best model was selected and applied to a collection of tweets from Twitter to demonstrate its usefulness in understanding contradiction semantically and quantitatively in a large amount of user opinionated text.},

abstract = {Online crowdfunding platforms have given creators new opportunities to obtain funding. Despite the popularity and success of many projects on the platforms, the quality of crowd-funded products in the market (e.g., Amazon) was not statistically and scientifically evaluated yet. To fill the gap, in this paper, we (i) compare crowdfunded products with traditional products in terms of their ratings in the largest e-commerce market, Amazon; (ii) analyze characteristics of the successful products (received ≥ 4 star) and unsuccessful products (received &lt; 4 star); and (iii) build machine learning models in three different stages, which predict whether a crowdfunded product will receive high star ratings or not. Our experimental results show that crowdfunded products, on average, received lower rating than traditional products. Our predictive models effectively identify which product will receive high star-ratings from customers on Amazon. The datasets used in this paper will be available at http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~kmlee/data.html.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social media has been widely adopted by online users to share their opinions. Among users in signed networks, two types of opinions can be expressed. They can directly specify opinions to others via establishing positive or negative links; and they also can give opinions to content generated by others via a variety of social interactions such as commenting and rating. Intuitively these two types of opinions should be related. For example, users are likely to give positive (or negative) opinions to content from those with positive (or negative) links; and users tend to create positive (or negative) links with those that they frequently positively (or negatively) interact with. Therefore we can leverage one type of opinions to power the other. Meanwhile, they can enrich each other that can help mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start problems in the corresponding predictive tasks - link and interaction polarity predictions, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint link and interaction polarity predictions in signed networks. We first understand the correlation between these two types of opinions; and then propose a framework that can predict signed links and the polarities of interactions simultaneously. The experimental results on a real-world signed network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {With the increasing popularity of online video sharing platforms (such as YouTube and Twitch), the detection of content that infringes copyright has emerged as a new critical problem in online social media. In contrast to the traditional copyright detection problem that studies the static content (e.g., music, films, digital documents), this paper focuses on a much more challenging problem: one in which the content of interest is from live videos. We found that the state-of-the-art commercial copyright infringement detection systems, such as the ContentID from YouTube, did not solve this problem well: large amounts of copyright-infringing videos bypass the detector while many legal videos are taken down by mistake. In addressing the copyright infringement detection problem for live videos, we identify several critical challenges: i) live streams are generated in real-time and the original copyright content from the owner may not be accessible; ii) streamers are getting more and more sophisticated in bypassing the copyright detection system (e.g., by modifying the title, tweaking the presentation of the video); iii) similar video descriptions and visual contents make it difficult to distinguish between legal streams and copyright-infringing ones. In this paper, we develop a crowdsourcing-based copyright infringement detection (CCID) scheme to address the above challenges by exploring a rich set of valuable clues from live chat messages. We evaluate CCID on two real world live video datasets collected from YouTube. The results show our scheme is significantly more effective and efficient than ContentID in detecting copyright-infringing live videos on YouTube.},

abstract = {Social Live Stream Services (SLSS) exploit a new level of social interaction. One of the main challenges in these services is how to detect and prevent deviant behaviors that violate community guidelines. In this work, we focus on adult content production and consumption in two widely used SLSS, namely Live.me and Loops Live, which have millions of users producing massive amounts of video content on a daily basis. We use a pre-trained deep learning model to identify broadcasters of adult content. Our results indicate that moderation systems in place are highly ineffective in suspending the accounts of such users. We create two large datasets by crawling the social graphs of these platforms, which we analyze to identify characterizing traits of adult content producers and consumers, and discover interesting patterns of relationships among them, evident in both networks.},

abstract = {Peatland fire and haze events in Southeast Asia are disasters with trans-boundary implications, having increased in recent years along with rapid deforestation, land clearing and severe dry seasons. Aerosols are emitted in high concentrations from the fires, which degrade air quality and reduce visibility, in turn causing economic, social, health, and environmental problems. During haze events, it is critical for public authorities to have timely information about affected populations. Currently, Indonesian disaster management authorities manage forest and peatland fire and haze events based on satellite data and sensors. They are looking for more real-time information in order to better protect vulnerable populations and environment. This paper explores information on visibility extracted from photos shared on social media to improve forecasting performance for haze severity. Our results show that visibility information can improve forecast accuracy over a baseline approach with common features, namely data from satellites and ground air quality sensors. Furthermore, by using social media photos, our model adds a near real-time property to the forecast model, with potential to improve disaster management and mitigation.},

abstract = {Gender-based-violence is a serious concern in recent times. Due to the social stigma attached to these assaults, victims rarely come forward. Implementing policy measures to prevent sexual violence get constrained due to lack of crime statistics. However, the recent outcry on the Twitter platform allows us to address this concern. Sexual assaults occur at workplaces, public places, educational institutes and also at home. Policy level approaches and awareness campaign for these assaults would not be similar. So, we want to identify the risk factor associated with these sexual assaults. We extracted 0.7 million tweets during the #MeToo social media movement. Next, we employ deep learning techniques to classify these sexual violences. We observe that sexual assaults by a family member at own home is a more serious concern than harassment by a stranger at public places. This study reveals assaults by a known person are more prevalent than assaults by unknown strangers.},

abstract = {Cyberbullying has emerged as a large-scale societal problem that demands accurate methods for its detection in an effort to mitigate its detrimental consequences. While automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting cyberbullying incidents have been developed, the scalability of existing approaches has largely been ignored. At the same time, the complexities underlying cyberbullying behavior (e.g., social context and changing language) make the automatic identification of "the best subset of features" to use challenging. We address this gap by formulating cyberbullying detection as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. Based on this formulation, we propose a novel algorithm to drastically reduce the number of features used in classification. We demonstrate the utility, scalability and responsiveness of our approach using a real-world dataset from Instagram, the online social media platform with the highest percentage of users reporting experiencing cyberbullying. Our approach improves recall by a staggering 700%, while at the same time reducing the average number of features by up to 99.82% compared to state-of-the-art supervised cyberbullying detection methods, learning approaches that require weak supervision, and traditional offline feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.},

We build an online game platform; perform and analyze controlled laboratory experiments; form hypotheses; build, exercise, and evaluate network-based agent-based models; and evaluate the hypotheses in multiple abductive iterations, improving our understanding as the process unfolds. While the experimental results are of interest, the paper's thrust is methodological, and indeed establishes the potential of iterative abductive looping for the (computational) social sciences.},

abstract = {Generating friend recommendations in location-based social networks is a challenging task, as we have to learn how different contextual factors influence users' behavior to form social relationships. For example, the contextual information of users' check-in behavior at common locations and users' activities at close regions may impact users' relationships. In this paper we propose a deep pairwise learning model, namely FDPL. Our model first learns the low dimensional latent embeddings of users' social relationships by jointly factorizing them with the available contextual information based on a multi-view learning strategy. In addition, to account for the fact that the contextual information is non-linearly correlated with users' social relationships we design a deep pairwise learning architecture based on a Bayesian personalized ranking strategy. We learn the non-linear deep representations of the computed low dimensional latent embeddings by formulating the top-k friend recommendation task at location-based social networks as a ranking task in our deep pairwise learning strategy. Our experiments on three real world location-based social networks from Brightkite, Gowalla and Foursquare show that the proposed FDPL model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we evaluate the impact of contextual information on our model and we experimentally show that it is a key factor to boost the friend recommendation accuracy at location-based social networks.},

abstract = {Detecting local events (e.g., protests, accidents) in real-time is an important task needed by a wide spectrum of real-world applications. In recent years, with the proliferation of social media platforms, we can access massive geo-tagged social messages, which can serve as a precious resource for timely local event detection. However, existing local event detection methods either suffer from unsatisfactory performances or need intensive annotations. These limitations make existing methods impractical for large-scale applications. Through the analysis of real-world datasets, we found that the informativeness level of social media users, which is neglected by existing work, plays a highly critical role in distilling event-related information from noisy social media contexts. Motivated by this finding, we propose an unsupervised framework, named LEDetect, to estimate the informativeness level of social media users and leverage the power of highly informative users for local event detection. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset show that the proposed LEDetect model can improve the performance of event detection compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised approach. Also, we use case studies to show that the events discovered by the proposed model are of high quality and the extracted highly informative users are reasonable.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Leadership is an essential part of collective decision and organization in social animals, including humans. In nature, leadership is dynamic and varies with context or temporal factors. Understanding dynamics of leadership, such as how leaders change, emerge, or converge, allows scientists to gain more insight into group decision-making and collective behavior in general. However, given only data of individual activities, it is challenging to infer these dynamic leadership events. In this paper, we focus on mining and modeling frequent patterns of leadership dynamics. We formalize a new computational problem, Mining Patterns of Leadership Dynamics, as well as propose a framework as a solution of this problem. Our framework can be used to address several questions regarding leadership dynamics of group movement. We use the leadership inference framework, mFLICA, to infer the time series of leaders from movement datasets, then propose the approach to mine and model frequent patterns of leadership dynamics. We evaluate our framework performance by using several simulated datasets, as well as using the real-world dataset of baboon movement to demonstrate the application of our framework. There are no existing methods to address this problem, thus, we modify and extend the existing leadership inference framework to provide a non-trivial baseline. Our framework performs better than this baseline in all datasets. Moreover, we also propose a method to perform statistical significance tests, comparing inferred frequent patterns of leadership dynamics with our proposed null hypotheses. Our framework opens the opportunities for scientists to generate scientific hypotheses that can be tested statistically regarding dynamics of leadership in movement data.},

abstract = {This paper examines the problem of adaptive influence maximization in social networks. As adaptive decision making is a time-critical task, a realistic feedback model has been considered, called myopic. In this direction, we propose the myopic adaptive greedy policy that is guaranteed to provide a (1 -- 1/e)-approximation of the optimal policy under a variant of the independent cascade diffusion model. This strategy maximizes an alternative utility function that has been proven to be adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular. The proposed utility function considers the cumulative number of active nodes through the time, instead of the total number of the active nodes at the end of the diffusion. Our empirical analysis on real-world social networks reveals the benefits of the proposed myopic strategy, validating our theoretical results.},

Our analysis on predicting links between scientist and social media entities showed the AUC-ROC score of 0.73 and the AUC-PR score of 0.30. Similarly, predicting links between scientific publications and social media entities showed the AUC-ROC score of 0.80 and the AUC-PR score of 0.19.

abstract = {Simulating the behavior of economic agents fosters the analysis of interconnected markets' dynamics. Here, we extend the state-of-the-art by adding realistic details to simulating economic exchange networks. To this end, we use our economic network simulation framework TrEcSim, which is designed to support the following real-life features: specific complex network topologies, evolution of economic agent roles, dynamic creation of new economic agents, diversity in product types, dynamic evolution of product prices, and investment decisions at agent-level. Using TrEcSim, we simulate and determine the point at which the networks (having different topology types) transition from being a topocratic system to becoming a meritocratic one. Simulation also allows for analyzing the dynamic evolution of producers and middlemen distribution in the economic exchange network. Moreover, we gain valuable insight regarding the distribution of payoff for each agent-role in various economic exchange networks, as follows: when producers are assigned randomly to topological positions, the payoff distribution within the producers category is fat-tailed (only a handful of producers benefit from an increased payoff), while the payoff of the middlemen category closely resembles a normal (Gaussian) distribution. However, when the topological positions of producers are assigned preferentially, the payoff distributions of the two role categories reverse.},

Detecting compromised accounts, however, is challenging due to the noisy nature of social media posts and the difficulty in acquiring sufficient labeled data that can effectively capture a wide variety of compromised tweets from different types of hackers (spammers, vandals, cybercriminals, revenge hackers, etc). To address these challenges, this proposal presents a multi-view learning framework that employs nonlinear autoencoders to learn the feature embedding from multiple views, such as the tweets' content, source, location, and timing information and then projects the embedded features into a common lower-rank feature representation. Suspicious user accounts are detected based on their reconstruction errors in the shared subspace. Our empirical results show the superiority of CADET compared to several existing representative approaches when applied to a real-world Twitter dataset.},

abstract = {Social media has become an inevitable part of individuals personal and business lives. Its benefits come with various negative consequences. One major concern is the prevalence of detrimental online behavior on social media, such as online harassment and cyberbullying. In this study, we aim to address the computational challenges associated with harassment detection in social media by developing a machine learning framework with three distinguishing characteristics. (1) It uses minimal supervision in the form of expert-provided key phrases that are indicative of bullying or non-bullying. (2) It detects harassment with an ensemble of two learners that co-train one another; one learner examines the language content in the message, and the other learner considers the social structure. (3) It incorporates distributed word and graph-node representations by training nonlinear deep models. The model is trained by optimizing an objective function that balances a co-training loss with a weak-supervision loss. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using post-hoc, crowdsourced annotation of Twitter, Ask.fm, and Instagram data, finding that our deep ensembles outperform previous non-deep methods for weakly supervised harassment detection.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Recent advances in the field of network representation learning are mostly attributed to the application of the skip-gram model in the context of graphs. State-of-the-art analogues of skip-gram model in graphs define a notion of neighbourhood and aim to find the vector representation for a node, which maximizes the likelihood of preserving this neighborhood.In this paper, we take a drastic departure from the existing notion of neighbourhood of a node by utilizing the idea of coreness. More specifically, we utilize the well-established idea that nodes with similar core numbers play equivalent roles in the network and hence induce a novel and an organic notion of neighbourhood. Based on this idea, we propose core2vec, a new algorithmic framework for learning low dimensional continuous feature mapping for a node. Consequently, the nodes having similar core numbers are relatively closer in the vector space that we learn.We further demonstrate the effectiveness of core2vec by comparing word similarity scores obtained by our method where the node representations are drawn from standard word association graphs1 against scores computed by other state-of-the-art network representation techniques like node2vec, Deep-Walk and LINE. Our results always outperform these existing methods, in some cases achieving improvements as high as 46% on certain ground-truth word similarity datasets. We make all codes used in this paper available in the public domain: https://github.coin/Sani131112/Core2vec_test.},

abstract = {Graph representations have increasingly grown in popularity during the last years. Existing embedding approaches explicitly encode network structure. Despite their good performance in downstream processes (e.g., node classification), there is still room for improvement in different aspects, like effectiveness. In this paper, we propose, t-PNE, a method that addresses this limitation. Contrary to baseline methods, which generally learn explicit node representations by solely using an adjacency matrix, t-PNE avails a multi-view information graph---the adjacency matrix represents the first view, and a nearest neighbor adjacency, computed over the node features, is the second view---in order to learn explicit and implicit node representations, using the Canonical Polyadic (a.k.a. CP) decomposition. We argue that the implicit and the explicit mapping from a higher-dimensional to a lower-dimensional vector space is the key to learn more useful and highly predictable representations. Extensive experiments show that t-PNE drastically outperforms baseline methods by up to 158.6% with respect to Micro-F1, in several multi-label classification problems.},

abstract = {Due to the emergence of several nutrition-related mobile applications and websites in recent years, as well as the massive amount of crowd-sourced nutrition data, searching and finding relevant results has become increasingly difficult for users. This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with crowd-sourced food names that are noisy and not well-structured. Because food names are short in length, it is difficult to incorporate existing methods to achieve an optimal matching quality. Despite several recent studies on nutrition data, these challenges remain. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework for crowd-sourced food names that has significant real-world applications, including food search and food recommendations. In particular, we propose a deep learning based, multi-modal learning-to-rank model that leverages the text describing a food name and the numerical values that represent its nutritional information. To this end, we also introduce a novel type of loss-function, which extends standard triplets hinge loss function into a multi-modal scenario. The proposed model is flexible and supports various data types as well as an arbitrary number of modalities. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated through several experiments on real-data, consisting of more than six million instances.},

abstract = {The moderation of content in many social media systems, such as Twitter and Facebook, motivated the emergence of a new social network system that promotes free speech, named Gab. Soon after that, Gab has been removed from Google Play Store for violating the company's hate speech policy and it has been rejected by Apple for similar reasons. In this paper we characterize Gab, aiming at understanding who are the users who joined it and what kind of content they share in this system. Our findings show that Gab is a very politically oriented system that hosts banned users from other social networks, some of them due to possible cases of hate speech and association with extremism. We provide the first measurement of news dissemination inside a right-leaning echo chamber, investigating a social media where readers are rarely exposed to content that cuts across ideological lines, but rather are fed with content that reinforces their current political or social views.},

abstract = {Political campaigns have frequently used the online social network as an important environment to exhibit the candidate ideas, their activities, and their electoral plans if elected. Some users are more politically engaged than others. As an example, we can observe intense political debates, especially during major campaigns on Twitter. In such context, this paper presents a characterization of politically engaged user groups on Twitter during the 2016 US Presidential Campaign. Using a rich dataset with 23 million tweets, 115 thousand user profiles and their contact network collected from January 2016 to November 2016, we identified four politically engaged user groups: advocates for both main candidates, political bots, and regular users. We present a characterization of how Twitter users behave during a political campaign through the language patterns analysis of tweets, which users receive more popularity during the campaign and how tweets from each candidate may have affected their mood variation, as expressed by the messages they share.},

abstract = {In the context of community detection in online social media, a lot of effort has been put into the definition of sophisticated network clustering algorithms and much less on the equally crucial process of obtaining high-quality input data. User-interaction data explicitly provided by social media platforms has largely been used as the main source of data because of its easy accessibility. However, this data does not capture a fundamental and much more frequent type of participatory behavior where users do not explicitly mention others but direct their messages to an invisible audience following a common hashtag. In the context of multiplex community detection, we show how to construct an additional data layer about user participation not relying on explicit interactions between users, and how this layer can be used to find different types of communities in the context of Twitter political communication.},

abstract = {The rising popularity of social media has radically changed the way news content is propagated, including interactive attempts with new dimensions. To date, traditional news media such as newspapers, television and radio have already adapted their activities to the online news media by utilizing social media, blogs, websites etc. This paper provides some insight into the social media presence of worldwide popular news media outlets. Despite the fact that these large news media propagate content via social media environments to a large extent and very little is known about the news item producers, providers and consumers in the news media community in social media. To better understand these interactions, this work aims to analyze news items in two large social media, Twitter and Facebook. Towards that end, we collected all published posts on Twitter and Facebook from 48 news media to perform descriptive and predictive analyses using the dataset of 152K tweets and 80K Facebook posts. We explored a set of news media that originate content by themselves in social media, those who distribute their news items to other news media and those who consume news content from other news media and/or share replicas. We propose a predictive model to increase news media popularity among readers based on the number of posts, number of followers and number of interactions performed within the news media community. The results manifested that, news media should disperse their own content and they should publish first in social media in order to become a popular news media and receive more attractions to their news items from news readers.},

abstract = {Traditionally, news media organizations used to publish only a few editions of the printed newspapers, and all subscribers of a particular edition used to receive the same information broadcasted by the media organization. The advent of personalized news recommendations has completely changed this simpler news landscape. Such recommendations effectively produce numerous personalized editions of a single newspaper, consisting of only the stories recommended to a particular reader. Although prior works have considered news coverage of different newspapers, due to the difficulty of knowing what news is recommended to whom, there has been no prior study to look into the coverage of information in different personalized news editions. Moreover, the evolution of the effects of personalization on recommended news stories is also not explored. In this work, we make the first attempt to investigate these issues. By collecting extensive data from New York Times personalized recommendations, we compare the information coverage in different personalized editions and investigate how they evolve over time. We observe that the coverage of news stories recommended to different readers are considerably different, and these differences further change with time. We believe that our work will be an important addition to the growing literature on algorithmic auditing and transparency.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Link prediction is the problem of inferring new relationships among nodes in a network that are likely to occur in the near future. Classical approaches mainly consider neighborhood structure similarity when linking nodes. However, we may also want to take into account if the two nodes are already indirectly interacting and if they will benefit from the link by having an active interaction over the time. For instance, it is better to link two nodes u and v if we know that these two nodes will interact in the social network even in the future, rather than suggesting v', who will never interact with u.In this paper, we deal with a new variant of the link prediction problem: given a pair of indirectly interacting nodes, predict whether or not they will form a link in the future. We propose a solution to this problem that leverages the predicted duration of their interaction and propose two supervised learning approaches to predict how long will two nodes interact in a network. Given a set of network-based predictors, the basic approach consists of learning a binary classifier to predict whether or not an observed indirect interaction will last in the future. The second and more fine-grained approach consists of estimating how long the interaction will last by modeling the problem via survival analysis or as a regression task. Once the duration is estimated, new links are predicted according to their descending order. Experimental results on the Facebook Network and Wall Interaction dataset show that our more fine-grained approach performs the best with an AUROC of 0.85 and clearly beats a link prediction model that does not consider the interaction duration and is based only on network properties.},

We also show that incorporating node attribute information can help alleviate this problem and compare three different approaches to integrate this information with network representation learning for link prediction problems. Using five real-world network datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of one such approach, called SPIN, that can effectively combine the link structure with node attribute information and predict links between nodes in the same and different communities without favoring high degree nodes.},

Our contributions are two fold: we introduce privacy surfaces that combine sensitive user data at different levels of temporal granularity. Second, we introduce MIMiS, an unsupervised privacy-aware framework that clusters users as homogeneous groups with respect to their temporal signature. In addition, we explore the trade-off between intrusiveness and prediction accuracy. We extensively evaluate MIMiS on real data across a variety of privacy surfaces. MIMiS identified groups that are highly homogeneous w.r.t. user mental health scores and their academic performance.},

abstract = {One of the most effective approaches for detecting malicious activity in online social networks (OSNs) involves the use of social network honeypots - artificial profiles. Therefore, there is a growing need for the ability to reliably generate realistic artificial honeypot profiles in OSNs. In this research we present `ProfileGen' - a method for the automated generation of profiles for professional social networks, giving particular attention to producing realistic education and employment records. `ProfileGen' creates honeypot profiles that are similar to actual data by extrapolating the characteristics and properties of real data items. Evaluation by 70 domain experts confirms the method's ability to generate realistic artificial profiles that are indistinguishable from real profiles, demonstrating that our method can be applied to generate realistic artificial profiles for a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {It is well known that individuals in social networks tend to exhibit homophily, the preference of people to associate with others from the same social group or type. Graph assortativity or Modularity is the most accepted measure for the homophily level of the whole network. It is well defined for simple networks where each node has a single type, and edges are unweighted.In this work, we extend modularity and assortativity in several ways. First, we define type assortativity which measures the homophily level of each type and enable the comparison between types of different size within the network. Second, we extend the measures to the case of nodes with multiple types and weighted edges. We evaluate our definitions on a weighted, research collaboration, social network between the most cited authors in the ACM digital library. We use nationality-based multiple types where a author can belong to multiple nationalities. While nationality-based homophily is trivial when the network is large (based on local research at universities) our empirical results show that even for the top 1000 authors a high level of nationality-based homophily exists, and different nationalities exhibit a different level of homophily.},

abstract = {The growth of social media has created an open web where people freely share their opinion and even discuss sensitive subjects in online forums. Forums such as Reddit help support seekers by serving as a portal for open discussions for various stigmatized subjects such as rape. This paper investigates the potential roles of online forums and if such forums provide intended resources to the people who seek support. Specifically, the open nature of forums allows us to study how online users respond to seeker's queries or needs; through their response, we attempt to assess the range of topics covered by responders in regards to the issues, concerns and, obstacles faced by the victims of rape and sexual abuse, using rape-related posts from Reddit. We employ natural language processing techniques to extract topics of responses, examine how diverse these topics are to answer research questions such as whether responses are limited to emotional support; if not, what other topics are; what the diversity of topics manifests; and how online response differs from traditional response found in a physical world.},

abstract = {Prior work on algorithmic truth assessment on unreliable content, has mostly pursued binary classifiers - factual vs. fake - and disregarded the finer shades of untruth.

In this paper, we present a principled approach to capture these finer shades in automatically assessing and classifying news articles and claims.

abstract = {This paper makes use of a large dataset of anonymized banking transactions and phone calls to classify individuals into socioeconomic groups (SEGs) and social networks, determine their consumption patterns, and compare the latter with equivalent information available from household surveys. The results obtained demonstrate that classification into SEGs by aggregated bank income provides a robust breakdown of the population that is validated by a social network analysis of the phone data. In addition, the spending profile obtained for each SEG shows that individuals behave similarly according to their income and their spending can be accurately categorized. Furthermore, the consumption patterns obtained from this novel approach can be contrasted directly with those obtained from national household surveys, potentially overcoming some of the limitations of traditional approaches in terms of coverage and inclusiveness. The work presented here shows the feasibility and capabilities of Big Data sources and tools to understand the consumption behavior of the population.},

In this paper, we show the value metrics generated from LLA in a use case of analyzing business news. We show the results from LLA are validated and correlated with the ground truth. We show that by using game theory, the high-value information selected by LLA reaches a Nash equilibrium by superpositioning popular and anomalous information, and at the same time generates high social welfare, therefore, contains higher intrinsic value.},

abstract = {Combating copyright infringing multimedia content has arisen as a critical undertaking in online video sharing platforms, such as YouTube and Twitch. In contrast to the traditional copyright detection problem that studies the static content (e.g., music, films, digital documents), the proposed system focuses on a much more challenging problem: detecting copyright infringements in live video streams. This is motivated by the observation that a large amount of copyright-infringing videos bypass the detector while many legal videos are taken down by mistake. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that is dedicated to combating the copyright infringements in live video streams. The system to be demonstrated consists of 1) a web front-end for user interaction and customized video query, 2) a scalable and real-time video crawling system that can collect video metadata, live chat messages, and visual content of the live video streams on video sharing platforms, and 3) a novel supervised copyright detection engine that leverages the live chat messages of the audience to detect the copyright infringement of live videos.},

Likewise, there is a vast amount of information and opinions posted about humanitarian issues on social media. Mining such data can provide timely knowledge to inform disaster resource allocation for who needs what and where as well as policies for humanitarian causes. However, information overload is a key challenge in leveraging this big data resource for organizations. We present an interactive user-feedback based streaming analytics system `CitizenHelper-Adaptive' to mine social media, news, and other public Web data streams for emergency services and humanitarian organizations. The system aims to collect, organize, and visualize the vast amounts of data across various user and content-based information attributes using the adaptive machine learning models, such as intent classification models to continuously identify requests for help or offers of help during disasters. This demonstration shows the first application of transfer-active learning methods for time-critical events, when there is an availability of abundant labeled data from past events but a scarcity of the sufficient labeled data for the ongoing event. The proposed system provides a user interface to solicit expert feedback on the predicted instances from pretrained models and actively learns to improve the models for efficient information processing and organization. Finally, the system regularly updates the predicted information categories in the visualization dashboard. We will demo CitizenHelper-Adaptive system for case studies in both mass emergency events and humanitarian related topics such as gender violence using datasets of more than 50 million Twitter messages and news streams collected between 2016 and 2018.},

Transit agencies are seeking to move beyond traditional customer questionnaires and manual service inspections to leveraging open source indicators like social media for deteting emerging transit events. In this paper, we leverage Twitter data for early detection of metro service disruptions. Inspired by the multi-task learning framework, we propose the Metro Disruption Detection Model, which captures the semantic similarity between transit lines in Twitter space. We propose novel constraints on feature semantic similarity exploiting prior knowledge about the spatial connectivity and shared tracks of the metro network. An algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is developed to solve the proposed model. We run extensive experiments and comparisons to other models with real world Twitter data and transit disruption records from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to justify the efficacy of our model.},

abstract = {Existing works on local community detection in social networks focus on finding one single community a few seed members are most likely to be in. In this work, we address a much harder problem of multiple local community detection and propose a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm for finding multiple local communities for a single seed chosen randomly in multiple ground truth communities. The number of detected communities for the seed is determined automatically by the algorithm. We first apply a Breadth-First Search to sample the input graph up to several levels depending on the network density. We then use Nonnegative Matrix Factorization on the adjacency matrix of the sampled subgraph to estimate the number of communities, and then cluster the nodes of the subgraph into communities. Our proposed method differs from the existing NMF-based community detection methods as it does not use "argmax" function to assign nodes to communities. Our method has been evaluated on real-world networks and shows good accuracy as evaluated by the F1 score when comparing with the state-of-the-art local community detection algorithm.},

In this work, we identify the differences in how social media accounts identified as bots react to news sources of varying credibility, regardless of the veracity of the content those sources have shared. We analyze bot and human responses annotated using a fine-grained model that labels responses as being an answer, appreciation, agreement, disagreement, an elaboration, humor, or a negative reaction. We present key findings of our analysis into the prevalence of bots, the variety and speed of bot and human reactions, and the disparity in authorship of reaction tweets between these two sub-populations. We observe that bots are responsible for 9--15% of the reactions to sources of any given type but comprise only 7--10% of accounts responsible for reaction-tweets; trusted news sources have the highest proportion of humans who reacted; bots respond with significantly shorter delays than humans when posting answer-reactions in response to sources identified as propaganda. Finally, we report significantly different inequality levels in reaction rates for accounts identified as bots vs not.},

We conduct this study by analyzing the statistical behavior of posts and modeling user interactions around them. We have chosen Reddit as an example, since it has grown exponentially from a small community to one of the biggest social network platforms in the recent times. Due to its large user base and popularity, a variety of behavior is present among users in terms of their activity. Our study provides interesting insights about a large number of inactive posts which fail to gather attention despite their authors exhibiting Cyborg-like behavior to draw attention. We also present interesting insights about shortlived but extremely active posts emulating a phenomenon like Mayfly Buzz. Further, we present methods to find the nature of activity around highly active posts to determine the presence of Limelight hogging activity, if any. We analyzed over 2 million posts and more than 7 million user responses to them during entire 2008 and over 63 million posts and over 608 million user responses to them from August 2014 to July 2015 amounting to two one-year periods, in order to understand how social media space has evolved over the years.},

abstract = {Given a corpus of employee peer reviews from a large corporation where each review is structured into pros and cons, what are the prevalent traits that employees talk about? How can we describe the performance of an employee with just a few sentences, that help us interpret what their work is praised and criticized for? What is the best way to summarize an employee's reviews, while preserving the content and sentiment as well as possible?In this work, we study a large collection of corporation-wide employee peer reviews from a technology enterprise. Motivated by the challenges we outline in our analysis of employee review data, our work makes two main contributions in the domain of people analytics: (a) Sentiment-Aspect Model (SAM): we introduce a stylized log-linear model that identifies the hidden aspects and sentiment within an employee peer review corpus, (b) Interpretable Sentiment-Aspect Representations (EMPLOYEE2VEC): using SAM, we produce a vector space embedding for each employee, containing an overall sentiment score per aspect, and (c) Summarization of Employee Peer Reviews (PEERSUM): we summarize an employee's peer reviews with just a few sentences which reflect the most prevalent traits and associated sentiment for the employee as much as possible.We show that our model SAM can use the structure present in the dataset as supervision to discover meaningful latent traits and sentiment embodied in the reviews. Our employee vector representations EMPLOYEE2VEC provide a compact, interpretable overview of their evaluation. The review summaries extracted by PEERSUM provide text that explains the professional performance of an employee in a succinct and objectively quantifiable way. We also show how to use our techniques for people analytics tasks such as the analysis of thematic differences between departments, regions, and genders.},

abstract = {Sociological theories of career success provide fundamental principles for the analysis of social links to identify patterns that facilitate career development. Some theories (e.g. Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties Theory and Burt's Structural Hole Theory) have shown that certain types of social ties provide career advantage to individuals by facilitating them to access unique information and connecting them with a diverse range of others in different social cliques. The assessment of link types and prediction of new links in the external social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have been studied extensively. However, this has not been addressed in the enterprise social networks and especially the prediction of weak ties in the context of employee career development. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an Enterprise Weak Ties Recommendation (EWTR) framework which leverages enterprise social networks, employee collaboration activity streams and the organizational chart. We formulate weak ties recommendation as a link prediction problem. However, unlike any generic link prediction work, we first validated explicit enterprise social network with a set of heterogeneous collaboration networks and show assessment improves the explicit network's effectiveness in predicting new links. Furthermore, we leverage assessed social network for the weak ties prediction by optimizing the link prediction methods using organizational chart information. We demonstrate that optimization improves prediction accuracy in terms of AUC and average precision and our characterization of weak ties to a certain extent aligns with Granovetter's and Burt's seminal studies.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel system which utilizes information from a social network services to suggest food venues to users based on crowd preferences. To recommend an appropriate food venue for each crowd preference, the system ranks food venues in each region by using an improved collaborative filtering method based on the differences between locations and languages in geo-tagged tweets. A key feature of the proposed system is the ability to suggest food venues in regions where very few geo-tagged tweets are available in a specific language by using the weighted similarity by others' preferences. To implement the system, more than 26 million tweets from European countries were collected and analyzed based on 6 languages and 7 regions. Afterwards, we provide an evaluation of the ranked venues proposed by the system based on 89 French speakers in 7 European countries.},

abstract = {The exponential growth in the usage of smart devices, such as smartphones, interconnected wearables etc., creates a huge amount of information to manage and many research and business opportunities. Such smart devices become a useful tool for user movement recognition, since they are equipped with different types of sensors and processors that can process sensor data and extract useful knowledge. Taking advantage of the GPS sensor, they can collect the timestamped geographical coordinates of the user, which can then be used to extract the geographical location and movement of the user. Our work, takes this analysis one step ahead and attempts to identify the user's behavior and habits, based on the analysis of user's location data. This type of information can be valuable for many other domains such as Recommender Systems, targeted/personalized advertising etc. In this paper, we present a methodology for analyzing user location information in order to identify user habits. To achieve this, we analyze user's GPS logs provided through his Google location history, we find locations that user usually spends more time, and after identifying the user's frequently preferred transportation types and trajectories, we find what type of places the user visits in a regular base (such as cinemas, restaurants, gyms, bars etc) and extract the habits that the user is most likely to have.},

abstract = {Nowadays the demand on carpooling system increases due to the need to decrease car crowdedness, saving fuel cost, decrease pollution, etc. Carpooling services depend on combining different passengers in one car who are willing to go to the same place in specific time. In this paper, a novel framework that utilizes trip profile and semantic of places (point of interest) is proposed. Users' trips are distinguished into routine trips and occasional trips. For occasional trips, the user is offered a similar destination based on the semantic of destination such that the new location is within accepted range or in the route with respect to drivers and other passengers. The proposed framework is applied on real dataset of New York taxi. Two techniques have been applied one based on route matching and other applied machine learning. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms tradition carpooling system by reducing total number of trips by 22.3%in case of 3 passengers per car and by 26% in case of 4 passengers. While total number of trips has been reduced by 66% if 3 passengers accepted in one car, 74% if 4 passengers accepted when machine learning technique was applied on the same dataset.},

abstract = {Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are probabilistic tools of choice for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex networked systems such as social networks, sensor networks, financial markets, etc. Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM. In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding multivariate Gaussian distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i) estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized log-likelihood where the penalty is the l1 norm of difference between the foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background precision. We suitably modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM data show significant improvement in precision and recall for detecting structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window baseline.},

abstract = {Social interactions can be both positive and negative, and at various spatial and temporal scales. Negative interactions such as conflicts are often influenced by political, economic and social pre-conditions. The signatures of conflicts can be mapped and studied in the form of complex social networks. Using publicly available large digital databases of media records, we construct networks of actors involved in conflicts by aggregating the events over time. We then study the spatio-temporal dynamics and network topology of conflicts, which can provide important insights on the engaging individuals, groups, establishments and sometimes nations, pointing at their long range effect over space and time. Network analyses of the empirical data reveal certain statistical regularities, which can be reproduced using agent based models. The fat tails of actor mentions and network degree distributions indicate dominant roles of the influential actors and groups, which over time, form a part of a giant connected component. Targeted removal of actors may help preventing unruly events of conflicts. Inspired by the empirical findings, we also propose a model for interacting actors that can reproduce the most important features of our datasets.},

abstract = {Diffusion models are powerful tools for understanding the spread of diverse content such as information, opinions and ideas through social networks. Although these models have been successfully used to study the spreading dynamics such as viral marketing, there are many real scenarios (e.g. vaccination, evacuation) that require a more complex model. Hence, we propose a new hybrid framework that combines diffusion modelling with cognitive agent modelling. The hybrid, generic framework is grounded on BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention), an advanced, efficient cognitive agent framework. We demonstrate our framework to a wildfire evacuation case study consisting of 5,000 agents. We then compare and analyse the diffusion outcomes of our model against two baseline models, the standard Linear Threshold (LT) model and a slightly modified version of the LT model, across 17 different input configurations. The results show (statistically) significant differences with the baselines for the majority of the configurations, highlighting the need for cognitive agents in diffusion modelling. The framework presented here provides the basis for modelling complex reasoning to capture diffusion phenomena in complex and dynamic social systems.},

The study employs natural language processing and data science to detect the expression of wisdom. Two categories for wisdom in adversity are used: recognition of uncertainty and change, and cognitive empathy. Data processing is applied to 1,000 annotated tweets and extended to 43,436 tweets. The results show that it is viable to study wisdom in context using social networking sites data. This short paper discusses some of the findings.},

This problem is addressed through a survey conducted among the participants of a national information assurance exercise conducted in Sweden. Most participants were government officials and employees of commercial companies that operate critical infrastructure. The results give insight into information elements that are perceived as useful, that can be contributed to and required from other organizations, which roles and stakeholders would benefit from certain information, and how the organizations work with creating cyber common operational pictures today. Among findings, it is noteworthy that adversarial behavior is not perceived as interesting, and that the respondents in general focus solely on their own organization.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {To combat the evolving Android malware attacks, systems using machine learning techniques have been successfully deployed for Android malware detection. In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we first extract a set of features from the Android applications (apps) and represent them as binary feature vectors; with these inputs, we then explore the security of a generic learning-based classifier for Android malware detection in the presence of adversaries. To harden the evasion, we first present count featurization to transform the binary feature space into continuous probabilities encoding the distribution in each class (either benign or malicious). To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further introduce softmax function with adversarial parameter to find the best trade-off between security and accuracy for the classifier. Accordingly, we develop a system named DroidEye which integrates our proposed method for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on the real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DroidEye against adversarial Android malware attacks. Our proposed secure-learning paradigm is also applicable for other detection tasks, such as spammer detection in social media.},

abstract = {Micro-blogging sites provide a wealth of resources during disaster events in the form of short texts. Correct classification of these text data into various actionable classes can be of great help in shaping the means to rescue people in disaster-affected places. The process of classification of these text data poses a challenging problem because the texts are usually short and very noisy and finding good features that can distinguish these texts into different classes is time consuming, tedious and often requires a lot of domain knowledge. We propose a deep learning based model to classify tweets into different actionable classes such as resource need and availability, activities of various NGO etc. Our model requires no domain knowledge and can be used in any disaster scenario with little to no modification.},

abstract = {Recently, several journalistic accounts have suggested that Twitter is becoming a bellwether for mis- and disinformation due to the pervasiveness of bots. These bots are either automated or semi-automated. Understanding the intent and usage of these bots has piqued the scientific curiosity among researchers. To that effect, in this study, we analyze the role of bots in two distinct categories of real-world events, i.e., natural disasters and sports. We collected over 1.2 million tweets that were generated by nearly 800,000 users for Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria, and Mexico Earthquake. We corroborate our analysis by examining bots that engaged with the 2018 Winter Olympics. We collected over 1.4 million tweets generated by nearly 700,000 users based on the hashtags #Olympics2018 and #PyeongChang2018. We examined the social and communication network of bots and humans for the aforementioned events. Our results show distinctive patterns in the network structures of bots when compared with that of humans. Content analysis of the tweets further revealed that bots used hashtags more uniformly than humans, across all the events.},

abstract = {Online hacking forums have been used as communities where users, possibly cybercriminals, can learn and exchange knowledge, and purchase the necessary tools and information to commit various offences such as hacking, credit card/identity fraud, money laundering, and even cyberattacks on infrastructure. Monitoring these forums and identifying key players are important when investigating emergent threats and developing efficient disruption strategies. Literature shows the lack of studies regarding users' cross-forum activity. This paper presents an analysis of forum users' cross-posting in three hacking forums including user overlap among different hacking communities/forums and identify user roles based on the type of posts and their frequencies.

Nonetheless, the behavior of such algorithms usually lacks transparency, motivating measurements, modeling and analysis in order to understand and improve its properties. In this paper, we propose a reproducible methodology encompassing measurements and an analytical model to capture the visibility of publishers over a News Feed. First, measurements are used to parameterize and to validate the expressive power of the proposed model. Then, we conduct a what-if analysis to assess the visibility bias incurred by the users against a baseline derived from the model. Our results indicate that a significant bias exists and it is more prominent at the top position of the News Feed. In addition, we found that the bias is non-negligible even for users that are deliberately set as neutral with respect to their political views.},

abstract = {Unknown landscape identification is the problem of identifying an unknown landscape from a set of already provided landscape images that are considered to be known. The aim of this work is to extract the intrinsic semantic of landscape images in order to automatically generalize concepts like a stadium, roads, a parking lot etc., and use this concept to identify unknown landscapes. This problem can be easily extended to many security applications. We propose two effective semi-supervised novelty detection approaches for the unknown landscape identification problem using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Transfer Learning. This is based on the use of pre-trained CNNs (i.e. already trained on large datasets) already containing general image knowledge that we transfer to our domain. Our best values of AUROC and Average Precision scores for the identification problem are 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. In addition, we statistically prove that our semi-supervised methods outperform the baseline.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of technology and software, social media have become a necessity in our daily lives as it is a way for people to keep in touch with friends and share about current events. Some of the most popular social media and social networking sites that people use include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. Finding compatible persons to be friends on social media can be a challenge as many of the people recommended to the user by social media are people who are already friends with them or have been followed. However, when users are looking for friends, the real concern is whether they have common interests or hobbies with each other and whether they often interact with one another. In this paper, we propose friend recommendation algorithms revolving around music interests and interactions in social media.},

While a growing number of university campuses encourage the teaching strategies of Flipped Classroom to enhance students' learning responsibility and encourage them to become more active learners, this study argues that the students with less social network resources might not benefit from the advantages of these strategies. The investigation of forming and evolution of social network behind peer learning should understand the interplay of the social forces of social selection and social influence for developing effective strategies. Among the studies of curriculum and instruction, few foci on the function of peer learning and no studies have investigated the interactions by using dynamic social network analysis. This research applies the stochastic actor-based model to model these two social forces of knowledge sharing among peermediated learning. Drawing on the literature of the knowledge construction and social influence, it aims to have a better understanding of network dynamics in a Flipped Classroom by discovering how relationships created and identifying an individual and contextual attribute that facilitate its spontaneous knowledge contribution.},

Specifically, our study aims at revealing the political orientation of a Twitter user in the context of the 2016 Italian Constitutional Referendum. After having collected and processed over 1,200,000 tweets, we classified them as YES-oriented, NO-oriented or UNCERTAIN, by exploiting the Naive Bayes Multinomial Text classification algorithm. We found that Twitter is used massively for political deliberation and just by counting the messages related to a political party we can reveal the election result. Moreover, the words used by the YES party and the NO party twits are in line with the language used by politicians in the real word and this strongly supports our analysis. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to different scenarios, in which it is necessary to distinguish between two main classes and another UNCERTAIN class. Finally, the results obtained by our classification methodology are very promising and encourage us to continue investigating this topic, deriving suggestions for further research.},

Our focus, by contrast, is to investigate the feasibility of computing the k-truss on a single consumer-grade machine within a reasonable amount of time. We engineer two efficient k-truss decomposition algorithms: the edge-peeling algorithm proposed by J. Wang and J. Cheng and the asynchronous h-index-updating algorithm proposed by A. E. Sariyuce, C. Seshadhri, and A. Pinar. We reduce their memory usage significantly by optimizing the underlying data structures and by using WebGraph, an efficient framework for graph compression. With our optimized implementation, we show that we can efficiently compute k-truss decomposition of large networks (e.g., a graph with 1.2 billion edges) on a single consumer-grade machine.},

Achieving finegrained object detection to detect different types within one class of objects can be crucial in tasks like automated retail checkout. This research has developed deep learning models to detect 200 types of similar birds. The models were trained and tested on CUB-200-2011 dataset.

Thus, we build general purpose language models that take advantage of large standing corpora and computational resources proactively, allowing us to build more specialized analytical tools from smaller data sets on demand. We show that it is possible to construct a language model from a small, focused corpus by first training an LSTM language model on a large corpus (e.g., the text from English Wikipedia) and then retraining only the internal transition model parameters on the smaller corpus. We also show that a single general language model can be reused through transfer learning to create many distinct special purpose language models quickly with modest amounts of data.},

abstract = {The online apparel retail market size in the United States is worth about seventy-two billion US dollars. Recommender systems on retail websites generate a lot of this revenue. Thus, improving recommender systems can increase their revenue. Traditional recommendations for clothes consisted of lexical methods. However, visual-based recommendations have gained popularity over the past few years. This involves processing a multitude of images using different image processing techniques. In order to handle such a vast quantity of images, deep neural networks have been used extensively. With the help of fast Graphics Processing Units, these networks provide results which are extremely accurate, within a small amount of time. However, there are still ways in which recommendations for clothes can be improved. We propose an event-based clothing recommender system which uses object detection. We train a model to identify nine events/scenarios that a user might attend: White Wedding, Indian Wedding, Conference, Funeral, Red Carpet, Pool Party, Birthday, Graduation and Workout. We train another model to detect clothes out of fifty-three categories of clothes worn at the event. Object detection gives a mAP of 84.01. Nearest neighbors of the clothes detected are recommended to the user.},

abstract = {In the current era of big data, advanced technology has led to easy collection or generation of high volumes of a wide variety of valuable data of different veracity. As rich sources of big data, social networks consist of users (or social entities) who are often linked by some interdependency such as 'following' relationships. Since these big social networks keep growing at a high velocity, there are situations in which an individual user (or business) wants to find those frequently followed groups of social entities so that he can also follow the same groups. Discovery of these frequently followed groups can be challenging because the social networks are usually big (with lots of users/social entities) but can be sparsely distributed (with most users only know some but not all users/social entities in some portions of a social network). In this paper, we present a social network mining algorithm that uses different compressed models to space-efficiently represent social entities so as to facilitate the discovery of groups of frequently followed social entities from these big but sparsely distributed social networks. Evaluation results show the practicality of our algorithm in efficient mining of 'following' patterns from big but sparsely distributed social networks.},

abstract = {One of the most attractive problems of social network analysis is the link prediction. Social networks' user growth is mostly supported with data driven friend recommendations which are provided by link predictors. Previously, we had studied new features to improve prediction accuracy in Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) where users share temporal location information with check-in interactions. In this paper, we focused on the efficiency of link predictors as the speed of prediction is as critical as its accuracy in LBSNs. Extraction time costs and prediction accuracy of individual LBSN features are mined to pick a feature subset that is achieving faster link prediction while not losing from accuracy.},

abstract = {Providing easy and hassle-free product returns have become a norm for e-commerce companies. However, this flexibility on the part of the customer causes the respective e-commerce companies to incur heavy losses because of the delivery logistics involved and the eventual lower resale value of the product returned. In this paper, we consider data from one of the leading Indian e-commerce companies and investigate the problem of product returns across different lifestyle verticals. One of the striking observations from our measurements is that most of the returns take place for apparels/garments and the major reason for the return as cited by the customers is the "size/fit" issue. Here we develop, based on past purchase/return data, a model that given a user, a brand and a size of the product can predict whether the user is going to eventually return the product. The methodological novelty of our model is that it combines concepts from network science and machine learning to make the predictions. Across three different major verticals of various sizes, we obtain overall F-score improvements between 10% -- 25% over a na\"{\i}ve baseline where the clusters are obtained using simple random walk with restarts.},

abstract = {The use of internet news sites increases day by day. The internet has gone beyond institutions and organizations to provide a different service and there have been attempts to provide services only through the internet and thus to earn money. It can also be a organization or an individual who opens an account on the social network and provides financial gain on these accounts. The financial gain on the internet is increasing in parallel with the number of people entering the site in general or the number of people reading the content on the site. Clickbait is a click technique in which a user manipulates the curiosity of a person in order to open more pages in a web site, usually by writing exaggerated and unreal headlines. In this study, headlines or subheadings for news were collected. In these news articles, the Clickbait headline identified by TF-IDF has summarized by looking at the content of the Clickbait news with text feature extraction based on ontology method. The summarized version has been shown to the user without having to click on the newsletter. In this study, news in 4 news sites with Turkish and English content were examined. This study is the first Turkish study about Clickbait detection. In the English tests, results have given in comparison with equivalent algorithms and explained in detail.},

abstract = {The problem of plagiarism the recent years has been intensified by the availability of information in digital form and the accessibility of the electronic libraries through the Internet. As a result, plagiarism detection has been transformed into a big data analytics problem since the number of digital sources is extravagant and a new document needs to be compared with millions of other existing documents. In this paper, a text mining methodology is proposed that can detect all common patterns between a document and the documents in a reference database. The technique is based on a pattern detection algorithm and the corresponding data structure that enables the algorithm to detect all common patterns. The methodology has been applied in a well-defined dataset providing very promising results identifying difficult cases of plagiarism such as technical disguise.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Dynamic community detection is a key method for the research of network evolution. However, most existing dynamic community detection algorithms are time-consuming in dealing with large-scale networks. Moreover, most current parallel community detection algorithms are static and they ignore the changes of network structure over time. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel algorithm based on incremental vertices, which is able to process large-scale dynamic networks, called PICD. In PICD algorithm, the revised Parallel Weighted Community Clustering (PWCC) metric is conductive to a convenient calculation, which is more sensitive to community structure compared to other metrics. The PICD approach consists of two main steps. Firstly, it identifies the incremental vertices in the dynamic network. Secondly, it maximizes the PWCC of the entire network by merely adjusting the community membership of incremental vertices to capture community structure in high quality. The results of experiments on both the synthetic and real world networks demonstrate that the PICD algorithm achieves a higher accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it performs more stable than most of the baseline methods. The experiments also show that PICD algorithm takes an almost linear time with the growth of the network scale.},

abstract = {Causal inference and analytics plays a critical role in public health and disease prevention. Through mining of large patient datasets, it is possible to identify opportunities for intervention and to determine the effectiveness of treatment. There are currently many methods to analyze and learn causal relationships in large patient datasets, as well as specific causal studies in epidemiology that define specific relationships among symptoms and treatments. This paper introduces a novel methodology to utilize causal knowledge to extend and improve a standard hierarchical medical ontology. First, we will obtain the hierarchical structure of the patient symptom variables based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA). Then, we will learn a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) using Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC), a hybrid constraint and score-based learning algorithm, on the pre-existing National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) study on Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) patient dataset. Finally, we will use the causal links discovered in the CBN to evolve the ontology and its hierarchy.},

abstract = {Improving seasonal influenza forecasting combining official data sources with web search and social media is a recent research topic which can enhance situational awareness of healthcare organizations when monitoring the outbreak of seasonal flu. In this paper, a prediction model based on autoregression that combines data coming from official influenza surveillance system, with data from web search and social media regarding influenza is proposed. The model is evaluated on the two influenza seasons 2016--2017 and 2017--2018, restricted to Italy. The results show that by using Web-based social data, like Google search queries and tweets, we can obtain accurate weekly influenza predictions up to four weeks in advance. The proposed approach improves real-time influenza forecast compared to traditional surveillance systems based on data from sentinel doctors: the prediction error is reduced up to 47%, while the Pearson's correlation is improved of about 24%.},

abstract = {This research analyzes scientific information sharing behaviors on Twitter. Over an eleven-month period, we collected tweets related to the controversy over the supposed linkage between the MMR vaccine and autism. We examined the usage pattern of scientific information resources by both sides of the ongoing debate. Then, we explored how each side uses scientific evidence in the vaccine debate. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the usage of scientific and non-scientific URLs by both polarized opinions. A domain network, which connects domains shared by the same user, was generated based on the URLs "tweeted" by users engaging in the debate in order to understand the nature of different domains and how they relate to each other. Our results showed that people with anti-vaccine attitudes linked many times to the same URL while people with pro-vaccine attitudes linked to fewer overall sources but from a wider range of resources, and that they provided fewer total links compared to people with anti-vaccine attitudes. Moreover, our results showed that vocal journalists have a huge impact on users' opinions. This study has the potential to improve understanding about how health information is disseminated via social media by showing how scientific evidence is referenced in discussions about controversial health issues. Monitoring scientific evidence usage on social media can reveal concerns and misconceptions related to the usage of these types of evidence.},

abstract = {Machine (learning)-based techniques have made substantial advances recently, and there is a general suggestion that they will drive major changes in health care within a few years. Yet, we all suffer from the lack of precise comparative studies on the accuracy of machine-based interpretations of medical data. To fill this gap, in this paper we investigate on the efficacy of using an automated mood analysis methodology to understand how patients react to the prescription to take different kinds of prenatal diagnostic tests (invasive vs non-invasive) and to the corresponding outcomes, based on conversations developed on Reddit. Our study essentially provides answers to research questions concerning: i) the popularity of prenatal diagnosis, ii) the patients' sentiment about different prenatal tests, iii) the existence of a cause-effect relationship between prenatal testing and patients' mood, and iv) the type of dialogues held by patients and physicians on this topic. Nonetheless, a general result emerging from our research is that a machine-based decision loop for now still needs human involvement, at least to alleviate the tension between empirical data and their correct medical interpretation.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to use eye-tracking data to predict students' concentration on both combined "photo and text" and "text only" HIV campaign messages. Eye-tracking was used to measure attention allocation processes to HIV campaigns. Each study participant completed a post-eye-tracking questionnaire to determine the recall of HIV messages and the relationship between eye-tracking measures with cognitive processing of HIV messages. In total, 60 students were randomly selected from Westville and Howard campuses of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test used to determine relationship between participants' ages, sex and educational level with gaze parameters, indicated that age had a statistically significant effect on measures of search and processing. Using Tukey's pair-wise post-hoc test, age was found to significantly affect the average saccade length and fixation/saccade ratio. The higher fixation/saccade ratio for male students, meant that males had more processing and less search activity than females. Mean fixation attention heat-maps, showed that younger students at high school, paid attention to only combined "photo and text" messages, while university students, in addition to fixating on combined "photo and text" messages, also paid significant attention to "text only" messages.},

abstract = {Ruptured intracranial aneurysms are associated with a high rate of mortality and disability due to the difficulty in predicting the rupture and complexity of the condition itself. Clinical narratives such as progress summaries and radiological reports, etc. contain key biomarkers, medical signs, and symptoms. By applying ontology-based information extraction on clinical narratives to extract important evidences and subsequently using machine learning can help to make decision support tools for complex decision making such as prediction of aneurysm rupture. According to best of our knowledge, there doesn't exist any work to extract clinical features from clinical narratives to predict the rupture of intracranial/Brain aneurysms (BA). While no single factor individually contributes to the risk of rupture of a BA, it is important to consider the combined impact of these aspects to understand the rupture probability of the aneurysm. In this paper, we explore the impact of size as a relative factor in saccular aneurysms with respect to location, gender and symptomatic/asymptomatic aspects of BA. Our study involves descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis on features extracted from retrospective electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing (NLP) and ontology-based information extraction techniques. Our analysis shows that size alone is not the sole contributor for rupture but the combination of size, location and patient's gender can influence aneurysm ruptures. Our results also show interesting insight that on same vasculature location, the average size of ruptured aneurysms for females is always smaller than that of males.},

During the investment planning stage, portfolio optimization plays a crucial role, especially for the medium and long-term investors, in determining the allocation weight of assets to achieve the balance between investors expectation return and risk tolerance. The literature on the topic of portfolio optimization has been offering plenty of theoretical and practical guidance for implementing the theory; however, there is a paucity of studies focusing on the applications which are designed for Robo-Advisors. In this research, we proposed a modular system and focused on integrating big data analysis, deep learning method and the Black-Litterman model to generate asset allocation weight. We developed a portfolio optimization module which takes the information from a variety of sources, such as stocks prices, investor profile and the other alternative data, and used them as input to calculate optimal weights of assets in the portfolio. The module we developed could be used as a sub-system for Robo-Advisors, which offers a customized optimal portfolio based on investors preference.},

In this paper, we propose a family of social capital measures in line with this interpretation. Our measures are designed for a model of social networks based on weighted and attributed graphs, and cover four dimensions of social capital: (i) access to resources, (ii) access to superiors, (iii) homogeneity of ties, and (iv) heterogeneity of ties. We demonstrate the real-world application of our measures by exploring an illustrative use case in the form of a workplace social network.},

abstract = {Research related to information diffusion within complex networks tends to focus on the effective ways to maximize its reach and dynamics. Most of the strategies are based on seeding nodes according to their potential role for social influence. The presented study shows how the seeding can be supported by changes in the target users' motivation to spread the content, thus modifying the propagation probabilities. The allocation of propagation probabilities to nodes takes the form of a spraying process following a given probability distribution, projected from the nodes' rankings. The results showed how different spraying strategies affect the results when compared to the commonly used uniform distribution. Apart from the performance analysis, the empirical study shows to which extent the seeding of nodes with high centrality measures can be compensated by seeding the nodes which are ranked lower, but are having higher motivation and propagation probabilities.},

abstract = {One of the most interesting problems in network analysis is community detection, i.e. the partitioning of nodes into communities, with many edges connecting nodes of the same community and comparatively few edges connecting nodes of different communities. We introduce a new quality measure to evaluate a partitioning of an undirected and unweighted graph into communities that is called inclusion. This quality measure evaluates how well each node is included in its community by considering both its existent and its non-existent edges. We have implemented a strategy that maximizes the inclusion criterion by moving each time a single node to another community. We also considered inclusion as a criterion for evaluating partitions provided by spectral clustering. In our experimental study, the inclusion criterion is compared to the widely used modularity criterion providing improved community detection results without requiring the a priori specification of the number of communities.},

abstract = {With the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era, the combination of AI with financial technology (FinTech) has become a development trend in the financial industry. However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model. The main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for AI conversational robo-advisor.},

abstract = {Although many new methods that aim to improve the performance of link prediction have been proposed in recent years, there is still no widely accepted benchmark for evaluating and comparing these link prediction methods. In this paper, we propose LPBenchmark, a solution towards a fair and effective benchmark for link prediction. LPBenchmark offers a suite of well-selected datasets covering major research fields in link prediction without redundancy. These datasets are selected from widely adopted open access collections of datasets via performing AHC(Adapted Hierarchical Clustering) and DNFS(Deepest Node First Selection) Algorithm. LPBenchmark measures the difficulty of each selected dataset through OSR(Optimal Subset Regression) Algorithm, which makes it possible to fairly compare the experiment performance of two methods operated on different datasets. Moreover, LPBenchmark includes three APIs, allowing researchers to obtain the largest connected components of a dataset, modify a dataset based on node degree and construct subgraphs based on node clustering coefficients. After presenting all the characteristics and functionalities of LPBenchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on several classic and newly proposed link prediction methods by using LPBenchmark. Results show that LPBenchmark is not only capable of fairly comparing each method's overall performance, but also can reveal each method's advantages and limitations on different types of networks.},

title = {IDetector: Automate Underground Forum Analysis Based on Heterogeneous Information Network},
year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Online underground forums have been widely used by cybercriminals to trade the illicit products, resources and services, which have played a central role in the cybercriminal ecosystem. Unfortunately, due to the number of forums, their size, and the expertise required, it's infeasible to perform manual exploration to understand their behavioral processes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named iDetector to automate the analysis of underground forums for the detection of cybercrime-suspected threads. In iDetector, to detect whether the given threads are cybercrime-suspected threads, we not only analyze the content in the threads, but also utilize the relations among threads, users, replies, and topics. To model this kind of rich semantic relationships (i.e., thread-user, thread-reply, thread-topic, reply-user and reply-topic relations), we introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation, which is capable to be composed of different types of entities and relations. To capture the complex relationships (e.g., two threads are relevant if they were posted by the same user and discussed the same topic), we use a meta-structure based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness over threads. As different meta-structures depict the relatedness over threads at different views, we then build a classifier using Laplacian scores to aggregate different similarities formulated by different meta-structures to make predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use structural HIN to automate underground forum analysis. Comprehensive experiments on real data collections from underground forums (e.g., Hack Forums) are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iDetector in cybercrime-suspected thread detection by comparisons with other alternative methods.},

Our analysis demonstrates the spectrum of emotions evinced in reaction and the way those reactions spread over the event timeline. Also, with respect to topic analysis, we find "echo chambers", groups of people interested in similar aspects of the event. Encouraged by our results on these two event datasets, the paper seeks to enable a holistic analysis of social media messages in a time of crisis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for automatically detecting the presence of hate speech within the terrorist argument. Hate speech can be used by a terrorist group as a means of judging possible targets' guilt and deciding on their punishment, as well as a means of making people to accept acts of terror or even as propaganda for possibly attracting new members. In this paper, we examine both ideology expressed and practices employed by the Revolutionary Organization 17 November (hereafter 17N) that operated in Greece between the years of 1975 and 2002. Within this line of thought, we will focus on the ideological justification, ethical standing and deployment of the terrorist operations as presented in the communiqu\'{e}s published by 17N, emphasizing on the use of hate speech as a means of justifying their choices and actions, as well as a way of reaching out to Greek people. To decide on how the automatic classification will be performed, we experimented with different text analyzing techniques such as critical discourse and content analysis and based on the preliminary results of these techniques a classification algorithm is proposed that can classify the communiqu\'{e}s in three categories depending on the presence of hate speech. The methodology was tested over the existing dataset with all the communiqu\'{e}s and the corresponding results are discussed.},

Lately, YouTube, akin to other social media sites, has become a vehicle for spreading fake news, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and radicalizing content. However, lack ineffective image and video processing techniques has hindered research on YouTube. In this paper, we advocate the use of metadata in identifying such malicious behaviors. Specifically, we analyze metadata of videos (e.g., comments, commenters) to study a channel on YouTube that was pushing content promoting conspiracy theories regarding World War III. Identifying signals that could be used to detect such deviant content (e.g., videos, comments) can help in stemming the spread of disinformation. We collected over 4,145 videos along with 16,493 comments from YouTube. We analyze user engagement to assess the reach of the channel and apply social network analysis techniques to identify inorganic behaviors.},

abstract = {How can we identify individuals at risk of being drawn into online sex work? The spread of online communication removes transaction costs and enables a greater number of people to be involved in illicit activities, including online sex trade. As a result, social media platforms often work as springboard for criminal careers posing a significant risk to the economy, public health and trust. Detecting deviant behaviors online is limited by the poor availability of ground-truth data and machine learning tools. Unlike prior work which focuses exclusively on either qualitative or quantitative methods, in this paper we combine covert online ethnography with semi-supervised learning methodologies, using data from a popular European adult forum. We obtained risk assessment results of 78 users using covert online ethnography, and set out to build a machine learning model that can predict the risk factor in other 28,832 users. Results show that a combination-based approach in which all features are used yields the most accurate results.},

There is a need therefore in empirical understanding of human behavior during disasters as this could help in making decisions on how to prepare for disasters, how to properly act and strategically respond during and after a calamity. This study aims to understand human behavior during disaster through agent-based modeling and social network analysis. eBayanihan, a disaster management platform that uses crowdsourcing to gather disaster-related information was used to capture disaster behavior during a simulated disaster-event. Survey data was also used for disaster behavior modeling. Generated disaster behavior models and computed social network centrality measures using ORA-Netscenes shows that there are specific agents in the network that can play an important role during disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) operations.},

PS0 can facilitate forensic data analysis and proactively mitigate insider threats by leveraging rule-based anomaly detection. In all too many cases, rule-based anomaly detection can detect employee deviations from organizational security policies. In addition, PS0 can be considered a security provenance solution because of its ability to fully reconstruct attack patterns. Provenance graphs can be further analyzed to identify deceptive actions and overcome analytical mistakes that can result in bad decision-making, such as false attribution. Moreover, the information can be used to enrich the available intelligence (about intrusion attempts) that can form use cases to detect and remediate limitations in the system, such as loosely-coupled provenance graphs that in many cases indicate weaknesses in the physical security architecture. Ultimately, validation of the framework through use cases demonstrates and proves that PS0 can improve an organization's security posture in terms of physical security and insider threat detection.},

We chose Twitter as our experimental social media platform due to its popularity and effectiveness for the dissemination of news and stories about recent events happening around the world. Our approach is the first of its kind to make location inference from tweets using Quadtree spatial partitions and NLP, in hybrid word-vector representations. The proposed algorithm achieved significant classification accuracy and outperformed state-of-the-art grid-based content-only location inference methods by up to 24% in correctly predicting tweet locations within a 161km radius and by 300km in median error distance on benchmark datasets.},

In this work, we propose an ear detection system that uses Faster R-CNN. The training of the system is performed on two stages: First, an AlexNet model is trained for classifying ear vs. non-ear segments. Second, the unified Region Proposal Network (RPN) with the AlexNet, that shares the convolutional features, are trained for ear detection. The proposed system operates in real-time and accomplishes 98% detection rate on a test set, composed of data coming from different ear datasets. In addition, the system's ear detection performance is high even when the test images are coming from un-controlled settings with a wide variety of images in terms of image quality, illumination and ear occlusion.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Supercomputing environments are becoming the norm for daily use. However, their complex infrastructure makes troubleshooting and monitoring failures extremely difficult. This is because these infrastructures contain thousands of nodes representing various applications and processors. To address these concerns, we propose a real-time reliability analysis framework for high performance computing (HPC) environments where the contributions are three-fold. First, an improved data network extrapolation (DNE) methodology is proposed as a pre-processing module. This component incorporates the system failure information (i.e. job, fault, and error log files) and performs robust job-based failure accounting for sequential and parallel jobs. This element also performs cross-referencing to compute task-based failure accounting, where the assumption is made that tasks are comprised of either one or more jobs. Next, a reliability characterization and analysis (RCA) schema is proposed that takes the failure information from the DNE process to perform survival analyses on each individual node in addition to the entire reliability infrastructure. This is coupled with a failure metrics characterization (FMC) schema that estimates the failure metrics such as the mean time to failure (MTTF) as well as the hazard rate. Additionally, a comparative analysis is made between the Log-Normal or Weibull distributions in terms of modeling job and task-based failure activity. Empirical analysis using the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) illustrate the promise of this approach in terms of characterizing, monitoring, and troubleshooting failure behavior. The results of this work can aide systems administrators the dynamic tools to pinpoint and monitor failure behavior; its impacts; and alternative job-scheduling policies without interrupting production processes.},

They have been successfully applied in various industries, such as e-commerce, education and digital health. On the other hand, clustering approaches can help the recommender systems to group users into appropriate clusters, which are considered as neighborhoods in prediction process. Although it is a fact that preferences of users vary over time, traditional clustering approaches fail to consider this important factor. To address this problem, a social recommender system is proposed in this paper, which is based on a temporal clustering approach. Specifically, the temporal information of ratings provided by users on items and also social information among the users are considered in the proposed method. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the quality of recommendations based on the proposed method is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and coverage metrics.},

The LLA is an unsupervised machine learning paradigm that does not require manually labeled training data. Multilayer value metrics are defined based on game theory for LLA. We showed the following results: 1) the value metrics generated from LLA in a use case of an internet game and crowd-sourcing; 2) the results from LLA are validated and correlated with the ground truth; 3) the game-theoretic LLA can help an information provider to present the information in the most valuable way. The information presentation can solve a problem (e.g., a search request of innovation) that no other information providers can solve (i.e., expertise). In addition, it ties also to a broader context that the unique value can propagate through the consensus. Based on the game-theoretic LLA, an information provider should not always present expertise content or authoritative content but rather with a mixed strategy where each type of content is presented with certain probabilities for the best value overall.},

abstract = {An information network is represented as a graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent interactions between nodes. There can be multiple types of nodes and edges in such networks giving rise to homogeneous, multi-relational and heterogeneous networks. Link prediction problem is defined as predicting edges that are more likely to be formed in the network at a future time. Many measures have been proposed in the literature for homogeneous networks. Extensions of many of these measures to heterogeneous networks are not available. Further, the measures need to be redefined in order to utilize the weight and time information available with the interactions. In this work, along with the logical grouping of the measures as topological, probabilistic and linear algebraic measures for all types of networks, we fill the gaps by defining the measures where ever they are not available in the literature. The empirical evaluation of each of these measures in different types of networks on the DBLP benchmark dataset is presented. An overall improvement of 12% is observed in prediction accuracy when temporal and heterogeneous information is efficiently utilized.},

abstract = {Decision makers use partial information of networks to guide their decision, yet when they act, they act in the real network or the ground truth. Therefore, a way of comparing the partial information to ground truth is required. We introduce a statistical measure that analyzes the network obtained from the partially observed information and ground truth, which of course can be applied to the comparison of any networks. As a first step, in the current research, we restrict ourselves to networks of the same size to introduce such a method, which can be generalized to different size networks. We perform mathematical analysis on the random graph, and then apply our methodology to synthetic networks generated using five different generating models. We conclude with a statistical hypothesis test to decide whether two graphs are correlated or not correlated.},

abstract = {Hierarchical networks are prevalent in nature and society, corresponding to groups of actors - animals, humans or even robots - organized according to a pyramidal structure with decision makers at the top and followers at the bottom. While this phenomenon is seemingly universal, the underlying governing principles are poorly understood. Here we study the emergence of hierarchies in groups of people playing a simple dot guessing game in controlled experiments, lasting for about 40 rounds, conducted over the Internet. During the games, the players had the possibility to look at the answer of a limited number of other players of their choice. This act of asking for advice defines a directed connection between the involved players, and according to our analysis, the initial random configuration of the emerging networks became more structured over time, showing signs of hierarchy towards the end of the game. In addition, the achieved score of the players appeared to be correlated with their position in the hierarchy. These results indicate that under certain conditions imitation and limited knowledge about the performance of other actors is sufficient for the emergence of hierarchy in a social group.},

abstract = {Social networks have become a popular way for internet surfers to interact with friends and family members, reading news, and also discuss events. Users spend more time on well-known social platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) storing and sharing their personal information. This information together with the opportunity of contacting thousands of users attract the interest of malicious users. They exploit the implicit trust relationships between users in order to achieve their malicious aims, for example, create malicious links within the posts/tweets, spread fake news, send out unsolicited messages to legitimate users, etc. In this paper, we investigate the nature of spam users on Twitter with the goal to improve existing spam detection mechanisms. For detecting Twitter spammers, we make use of several new features, which are more effective and robust than existing used features (e.g., number of followings/followers, etc.). We evaluated the proposed set of features by exploiting very popular machine learning classification algorithms, namely k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayesian (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The performance of these classifiers are evaluated and compared based on different evaluation metrics. We compared the performance of our proposed approach with four latest state of art approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed set of features gives better performance than existing state of art approaches.},

abstract = {An organization of any society often takes on a complex structure, where many different communities may be identified which include or overlap one another. A significant question is how local activities affect its global position and also facilitate gaining position in other local communities. We discuss a problem of how a local group supports the user in achieving a significant global position. In this paper we present a model of the system containing descriptions of users and roles as well as results of analyses using data gathered from the blog portal Salon24. We describe relationships between global roles played by users in the whole social portal and local roles in given identified communities. Additionally, other useful characteristics of users of such analyzed portals are presented, such as: numbers of groups to which users with given roles belongs or the total numbers of global and local roles.},

abstract = {Network science fosters our understanding of many natural and man-made complex systems by providing models for evolution, emergence and reliability. Existing studies on network robustness mainly focus on targeted node attacks, where the topology shrinks until the network loses its basic functionality. Here, we bring a novel aspect into perspective. First, we investigate the fragility of networks when dealing with edge attacks instead of node attacks - a highly relevant scenario in dynamical social systems where, because of the frequent interactions, edges are dynamically created or destroyed. Second, we propose an intuitive edge repair model to respond after edge attacks. Accordingly, we study different strategies for targeted edge attack and edge repair, to find that real-world networks are generally more robust than synthetic ones, that high betweenness and high degree nodes present structural weak-spots for targeted attacks, and that repairing edges incident to high-degree nodes first offers the most effective response to an attack. Finally, we find evidence of a behaviour we tag as topological antifragility for networks that actually grow stronger when being under attack, due to the triggered edge repair strategy.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the field of Complex Social Networks. Several network generation models have been extensively studied to develop an understanding of how real world networks evolve over time. Two important applications of these models are to study the evolution dynamics and processes that shape a network, and to generate benchmark networks with known community structures. Research has been conducted in both these directions, relatively independent of the other. This creates a disjunct between real world networks and the networks generated as benchmarks to study community detection algorithms. In this paper, we propose to study both these application areas together. We introduce a network generation model which is based on evolution dynamics of real world networks and, it can generate networks with community structures that can be used as benchmark graphs. We study the behaviour of different community detection algorithms based on the proposed model and compare it with other models to generate benchmark graphs. Results suggest that the proposed model can generate networks which are not only structurally similar to real world networks but can be used to generate networks with varying community sizes and topologies.},

abstract = {Economic and convenience benefits of interconnectivity drive current explosive emergence and growth of networked systems. However, as recent catastrophic contagious failures in numerous large scale networked infrastructures demonstrated, these benefits of interconnectivity are inherently associated with various risks, including risk of undesirable contagion. Current research on network formation by contagion risk averse agents, which analyzes Nash or some other game-theoretic equilibrium notion of the corresponding game, suffers from interrelated problems of intractability and oversimplification. We argue that these problems can be alleviated with dynamic view, which assumes logit responses by strategic agents with utilities quantifying multiple competing incentives. While this approach naturally incorporates practically critical assumption of bounded rationality, it also allows for leveraging a vast body of results on network formation, e.g., preferential attachment in growing networks.},

abstract = {In many real-life applications it is crucial to be able to, given a collection of link states of a network in a certain time period, accurately predict the link state of the network at a future time. This is known as dynamic link prediction, which compared to its static counterpart is more complex, as capturing the temporal characteristics is a non-trivial task. This explains while still majority of today's research in network representation learning focuses on static setting ignoring temporal information. In this work, we focus on one such case and aim at extending node2vec, representation learning method successfully applied for static link prediction, to a dynamic setup. This extended method is applied and validated on several real-life networks with different properties. Results show that taking into account dynamic aspect outperforms static approach. Additionally, based on the network properties, recommendations are given for the node2vec parameters.},

In this paper, we analyze data from two BITCOIN marketplaces which include transactions between marketplace users and the ratings of those transactions given by those users. In this analysis we create a synthetic network model with similar topological properties as the networks of the interactions of both marketplaces. The results of our analysis show an interesting phenomenon in which user ratings, which range from -10 to 10, converge to a value of approximately two as the number of a user's transactions increase. Finally, we suggest future work on our synthetic model to improve its agreement with the transaction networks in order to better understand how reviews influence user decisions on transactions.},

abstract = {This work involves agent-based simulation of bootstrap percolation on hyperbolic networks. Our goal is to identify influential nodes in a network which might inhibit the percolation process. Our motivation, given a small scale random seeding of an activity in a network, is to identify the most influential nodes in a network to inhibit the spread of an activity amongst the general population of agents. This might model obstructing the spread of fake news in an on line social network, or cascades of panic selling in a network of mutual funds, based on rumour propagation. Hyperbolic networks typically display power law degree distribution, high clustering and skewed centrality distributions. We introduce a form of immunity into the networks, targeting nodes of high centrality and low clustering to be immune to the percolation process, then comparing outcomes with standard bootstrap percolation and with random selection of immune nodes. We generally observe that targeting nodes of high degree has a delaying effect on percolation but, for our chosen graph centralisation measures, a high degree of skew in the distribution of local node centrality values bears some correlation with an increased inhibitory impact on percolation.},

year = {2018},
isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {A well-known result in social science states that, although people maintain a large number of social relationships, in practice, their interactions are concentrated mostly on a small portion of their neighbors. According to Dunbar's hypothesis, this phenomenon is due to a limited human cognitive capacity to handle too many social relationships, together with a few time for socializing. These constraints result in an organization of people's ego-network into four or five groups depending on the strength of the interactions, the so called Dunbar's circles. The verification of the Dunbar's hypothesis, the identification of social circles and their characterization are still open questions, although researchers have found evidence of its validity on different social networks, from small offline networks to online social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. In addition, little is known about the semantic aspects of the circles, i.e. who are the members of each circle.In this paper, we cope with these issues by analyzing a mobile phone graph where people's interactions are expressed by both voice calls and text messages. We firstly compare two methods for the identification of the circles, which rely on the different definitions of strength proposed in literature. Both methods confirm the subdivision of ego-networks into four or five circles, each characterized by a specific interaction strength. Then, we validate the Dunbar's hypothesis and, by leveraging some powerful features of the mobile phone dataset in use, we provide a first semantic characterization of social circles. We show, for instance, that people maintain relationships with the members of the closest circles by combining calls and texts. In addition, by detecting home and work locations of each individual, we highlight that a semantic aspect, such as the role of the alters, impacts on the ego-network circles. In particular, family members and workmates are located in different circles: the former mainly form the closest circle, i.e. the support clique, while the latter are distributed among the outer circles.},

isbn = {9781538660515},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {User timelines in Online Social Media (OSM) remains filled with a significant amount of information received from followees. Given that content posted by followee is not under user's control, this information may not always be relevant. If there is large presence of not so relevant content, then a user may end up overlooking relevant content, which is undesirable. To address this issue, in the first part of our work, we propose suitable metrics to characterize the user-followee relationship. We find that most of the users choose their followees primarily due to the content that they post (content-conscious behavior, measured by content similarity scores). For a small number of followees, a high degree of social engagement (likes and shares) irrespective of the content posted by them is observed (user-conscious behavior, measured by user affinity scores). We evaluate our proposed approach on 26,516 followees across 100 random users on Twitter who have cumulatively posted 234,403 tweets. We find that on average for 60% of their followees, users exhibit very low degree of content similarity and social engagement. These findings motivate the second part of our work, where we develop a Followee Management Nudge (FMN) through a browser extension (plugin) that helps users remain more informed about their relationship with each of their followees. In particular, the FMN nudges a user with a list of followees with whom they have least (or never) engaged in the past and also exhibit very low similarity in terms of content, thereby helping a user to make an informed decision (say by unfollowing some of these followees). Results from a preliminary controlled lab study show that 62.5% of participants find the nudge to be quite useful.},

abstract = {Basketball is an inherently social sport, which implies that social dynamics within a team may influence the team's performance on the court. As NBA players use social media, it may be possible to study the social structure of a team by examining the relationships that form within social media networks. This paper investigates the relationship between publicly available online social networks and quantitative performance data. It is hypothesized that network centrality measures for an NBA team's network will correlate with measurable performance metrics such as win percentage, points differential and assists per play. The hypothesis is tested using exponential random graph models (ERGM) and investigating correlation between network and performance variables. The results show that there are league-wide trends correlating certain network measures with game performance, and also quantifies the effects of various player attributes on network formation.},
