abstract = {One of the widely studied structural properties of social and information networks is their community structure, and a vast variety of community detection algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Expansion of a seed node into a community is one of the most successful methods for local community detection, especially when the global structure of the network is not accessible. An algorithm for local community detection only requires a partial knowledge of the network and the computations can be done in parallel starting from seed nodes. The parallel nature of local algorithms allow for fast and scalable solutions, however, the coverage of the communities heavily depends on the seed selection. The communities identified by a local algorithm might cover only a subset of the nodes in a network if the seeds are not selected carefully.In this paper, we propose a novel seeding algorithm which is parameter free, utilizes merely the local structure of the network, and identifies good seeds which span over the whole network. In order to find such seeds, our algorithm first computes similarity indices from local link prediction techniques to assign a similarity score to each node, and then a biased graph coloring algorithm is used to enhance the seed selection. Our experiments using large-scale real-world networks show that our algorithm is able to select good seeds which are then expanded into high quality overlapping communities covering the vast majority of the nodes in the network using a personalized PageRank-based community detection algorithm. We also show that using our local seeding algorithm can dramatically reduce the execution time of community detection.},

abstract = {Finding patterns of interaction and predicting the future structure of networks has many important applications, such as recommendation systems and customer targeting. Community structure of social networks may undergo different temporal events and transitions. In this paper, we propose a framework to predict the occurrence of different events and transition for communities in dynamic social networks. Our framework incorporates key features related to a community - its structure, history, and influential members, and automatically detects the most predictive features for each event and transition. Our experiments on real world datasets confirms that the evolution of communities can be predicted with a very high accuracy, while we further observe that the most significant features vary for the predictability of each event and transition.},

abstract = {Community finding in social network analysis is the task of identifying groups of people within a larger population who are more likely to connect to each other than connect to others in the population. Much existing research has focussed on non-overlapping clustering. However, communities in real-world social networks do overlap. This paper introduces a new community finding method based on overlapping clustering. A Bayesian statistical model is presented, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is presented and evaluated in comparison with two existing overlapping community finding methods that are applicable to large networks.

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Although geographic and regional aspects of communities find many practical applications, e.g., in social studies and marketing, to date, existing approaches to community detection have paid little attention to these features when analyzing social network data. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the concept of regional LinkTopic communities and propose a novel probabilistic model for extracting such communities. Our model jointly considers the spatio-temporal proximity of users in terms of the messages they post over time, together with contextual links and message topics to determine communities. The model allows users to have a membership in more than just one community, an important feature when discovering communities based on topics. Each community derived by our approach is not only described by a mixture of topics but also by its regional properties. Using data from Twitter, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in extracting regional LinkTopic communities, which are described in terms of both geographic locations and coherent topics. The experimental results show that our model outperforms related models that only use links and topics to extract communities by the measure of perplexity.},

abstract = {Community structure as a significant feature helps us understand networks in a mesoscopic view. Existing approaches for community detection haven't considered about the formation of communities, whereas community in real social networks is usually established around influential nodes. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective framework based on local influence to detect both overlapping and hierarchical communities. We try to illuminate two fundamental questions: 1)Whether local influence regarded as a new property can affect the formation of communities; 2)How to quantify node's local influence and utilize it to detect communities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of local influence in terms of evaluating node importance, nodes with high local influence are selected to perform the influence maximization experiments on real social networks. Experimental results show that our framework is effective and efficient for both community detection and influence maximization.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been gaining tremendous growth and popularity in the last decade, as they have been attracting billions of users from all over the world. Such networks generate petabytes of data from the social interactions among their users and create many management and scalability challenges. OSN users share common interests and exhibit strong community structures, which create complex dependability patterns within OSN data, thus, make it difficult to partition and distribute in a data center environment. Existing solutions, such as, distributed databases, key-value stores and auto scaling services use random partitioning to distribute the data across a cluster, which breaks existing dependencies of the OSN data and may generate huge inter-server traffic. Therefore, there is a need for intelligent data allocation strategy that can reduce the network cost for various OSN operations. In this paper, we present a gossip-based partitioning and replication scheme that efficiently splits OSN data and distributes the data across a cluster. We achieve fault tolerance and data locality, for one-hop neighbors, through replication. Our main contribution is a social graph placement strategy that divides the social graph into predefined size partitions and periodically updates the partitions to place socially connected users together. To evaluate our algorithm, we compare it with random partitioning and a state-of-the-art solution SPAR. Results show that our algorithm generates up to four times less replication overhead compared to random partitioning and half the replication overhead compared to SPAR.},

abstract = {Customer reviews written at online shopping sites greatly influence the decision of potential buyers. Since existence of noise in reviews is inevitable, helping users alleviate the influence of these noisy reviews has become a fundamental issue for improving service quality in e-commerce transactions, especially for C2C (customer-to-customer) sites. In this paper, we present an approach to reduce the influence of noisy review and improve product ranking quality by using customer credibility. Customer credibility is used to measure to what degree the reviews can be trusted. A feedback strategy is designed to calculate the customer credibility, which relies on the consistency evaluation between individual reviews and overall reviews. Additionally, we provide a method to eliminate the inconsistency problem between the review comments and customer given scores, captured by the learned model on the training data that is constructed automatically. The final product scores are calculated by considering both the customer credibility and the predicted scores. The experimental results on real-world data sets show that our proposed approach provides better products ranking than baseline systems.},

The analyses show that entrepreneurs' networking in the public sphere has a direct positive impact on start-ups' innovation, while networking in the private sphere reduces innovation. Firms' networking for innovation intensifies with larger public sphere networks around the entrepreneurs but decreases with larger private sphere networking. Also, large private sphere networks around the entrepreneurs decrease effectiveness of networking for innovation. These findings refine our knowledge of the functioning of start-up firms' networking for innovation, especially the positive and negative imprints of the entrepreneurs' networking in the public and private spheres.},

abstract = {Finding1 a new mathematical representation for graphs, which allows direct comparison between different graph structures, is an open-ended research direction. Having such a representation is the first prerequisite for a variety of machine learning algorithms like classification, clustering, etc., over graph datasets. In this paper, we propose a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix with the (i, j)-th entry equal to the covariance between normalized vectors Aie and Aje (e being vector of all ones) as a representation for a graph with adjacency matrix A. We show that the proposed matrix representation encodes the spectrum of the underlying adjacency matrix and it also contains information about the counts of small sub-structures present in the graph such as triangles and small paths. In addition, we show that this matrix is a "graph invariant". All these properties make the proposed matrix a suitable object for representing graphs.The representation, being a covariance matrix in a fixed dimensional metric space, gives a mathematical embedding for graphs. This naturally leads to a measure of similarity on graph objects. We define similarity between two given graphs as a Bhattacharya similarity measure between their corresponding covariance matrix representations. As shown in our experimental study on the task of social network classification, such a similarity measure outperforms other widely used state-of-the-art methodologies. Our proposed method is also computationally efficient. The computation of both the matrix representation and the similarity value can be performed in operations linear in the number of edges. This makes our method scalable in practice.We believe our theoretical and empirical results provide evidence for studying truncated power iterations, of the adjacency matrix, to characterize social networks.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Signed directed social networks, in which the relationships between users can be either positive (indicating relations such as trust) or negative (indicating relations such as distrust), are increasingly common. Thus the interplay between positive and negative relationships in such networks has become an important research topic. Most recent investigations focus upon edge sign inference using structural balance theory or social status theory. Neither of these two theories, however, can explain an observed edge sign well when the two nodes connected by this edge do not share a common neighbor (e.g., common friend). In this paper we develop a novel approach to handle this situation by applying a new model for node types. Initially, we analyze the local node structure in a fully observed signed directed network, inferring underlying node types. The sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their types; this explains edge signs well even when there are no common neighbors. We show, moreover, that our approach can be extended to incorporate directed triads, when they exist, just as in models based upon structural balance or social status theory. We compute Bayesian node types within empirical studies based upon partially observed Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions networks in which the largest network (Epinions) has 119K nodes and 841K edges. Our approach yields better performance than state-of-the-art approaches for these three signed directed networks.},

abstract = {The entity disambiguation task partitions the records belonging to multiple persons with the objective that each decomposed partition is composed of records of a unique person. Existing solutions to this task use either biographical attributes, or auxiliary features that are collected from external sources, such as Wikipedia. However, for many scenarios, such auxiliary features are not available, or they are costly to obtain. Besides, the attempt of collecting biographical or external data sustains the risk of privacy violation. In this work, we propose a method for solving entity disambiguation task from link information obtained from a collaboration network. Our method is non-intrusive of privacy as it uses only the time-stamped graph topology of an anonymized network. Experimental results on two real-life academic collaboration networks show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The backbone is the natural abstraction of a complex network, which can help people to understand it in a more simplified form. Backbone extraction becomes more challenging as many networks are evolving into large scale and the weight distributions are spanning several orders of magnitude. Traditional filter-based methods tend to include many outliers into the backbone. What is more, they often suffer from the computational inefficiency-the exhaustive search of all nodes or edges is often prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose a Local Search based Backbone Extraction Heuristic (LS-BEH) to find the backbone in a complex weighted network. First, a strict filtering rule is carefully designed to determine edges to be preserved or discarded. Second, we present a local search model to examine part of edges in an iterative way. Experimental results on two real-life networks demonstrate the advantage of LS-BEH over the classic disparity filter method by either effectiveness or efficiency validity.},

abstract = {Identifying nodes that play important roles in network dynamics in large scale complex networks is crucial for both characterizing the network and resource management. Under the viral marketing setting, Diffusion Centrality (DC) estimates the influential power of an individual. For the transport and physics communities, a node is considered important in Markov centrality (MC) if it can be quickly reached from the other nodes. Because these networks could contain millions of nodes, any ranking algorithm must have low time requirements to be practically useful. In this paper, we show that both metrics are strongly correlated, and we present a new method to enable fast estimation of the two metrics for large scale networks. The new approach is further validated empirically by using both real and synthetic networks. Our results refined the intuition that the influential power of an individual is largely governed by the local topology, rather than the mere number of contacts (node degree) alone. This allows us to better characterize the properties of the nodes that affect the outcome of the two centrality metrics.},

The former are inherently descriptive of nodes, while the latter are characterizations of individual communities and roles. The generative process of the devised model assigns nodes to communities with respective roles and connects them through directed links, that are ruled by their personal and contextual interaction factors. We derive posterior inference for the presented model based on approximate Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods.

This paper presents a game-theoretic approach for community detection in dynamic social networks in which each node is treated as a rational agent who periodically chooses from a set of predefined actions in order to maximize its utility function. The community structure of a snapshot emerges after the game reaches Nash equilibrium; the partitions and agent information are then transferred to the next snapshot. An evaluation of our method on two real world dynamic datasets (AS-Internet Routers Graph and AS-Oregon Graph) demonstrates that we are able to report more stable and accurate communities over time compared to the benchmark methods.},

However, we consider the problem in the context of information gathered from law-enforcement agencies, financial institutions, and similar organizations, within which one would like to characterize and classify different types of persons of interest. The members of these networks tend to form special communities and thus new techniques are required.

abstract = {One of the key aspects instrumental in the advancement of science relates to "team science," or in other words "group" collaborations. There have been extensive studies analyzing various statistical properties of collaborations of individual or pairs of authors. However, the number of studies pertaining to groups/teams of scientists working together is limited in number. In this paper, we set an objective to study the productivity of group collaborations where groups are represented as small substructures usually termed as network motifs in the literature. A preliminary observation is that star-like motifs have the largest productivity (defined as a function of citation count) followed by 4-cliques. We then introduce a bunch of features and study their individual relations with the productivity of a team. Building on these observations, we develop a supervised classification model that can automatically distinguish the highly productive teams from the low productive ones based on the set of identified features. The accuracy of the classification is 82% on an average for all the motifs with the accuracy reaching as high as 95% for 4-cliques. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the time-transition behavior of different motifs along with some of the real world highly productive motifs found in our dataset. This empirical study is a first step toward the development of a full-fledged recommendation system that can predict how productive a team would be in the future.},

year = {2014},
isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Social media systems like Twitter and Facebook provide a global infrastructure for sharing information, and in one popular direction, of sharing web hyperlinks. Understanding the behavioral signals of both how URLs are inserted into these systems (via posting by users) and how URLs are received by social media users (via clicking) can provide new insights into social media search, recommendation, and user profiling, among many others. Such studies, however, have traditionally been difficult due to the proprietary (and sometimes private) nature of much URL-related data. Hence, in this paper, we begin a behavioral examination of URL sharing through two distinct perspectives: (i) the first is via a study of how these links are posted through publicly-accessible Twitter data; (ii) the second is via a study of how these links are received by measuring their click patterns through the publicly-accessible Bitly click API. We examine the differences between posting and click patterns in a sample application domain: the classification of spam URLs. We find that these behavioral signals - posting versus clicking - provide overlapping but fundamentally different perspectives on URLs, and that these perspectives can inform the design of future applications of spam link detection and link sharing.},

year = {2014},
isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Tie formation in social networks is driven by different motives that are not always apparent in the social network itself. These motives differ from one social network to another, depending on, e.g., the network's purpose, such as advice seeking or collaboration, and the effort it costs to establish a friendship relationship. A common factor that exists in almost all social networks is homophily: the tendency of social network members to connect to similar members. In this work, we look at the tie formation process in social networks from a different perspective where we consider not only a social network SN, but also a set of associated interaction networks Gn around it. We show, based on 6 social networks and in total 20 different associated interaction networks, that it is possible to predict the entire social network's structure to a satisfactory extent, only by knowing the structure of these interaction networks. As social networks are based on a voluntary relationship while some of the interaction relationships are at most semi-controllable for most members, e.g., being together in a team, this seems to indicate that whom we choose as a friend is also determined by whom we interact with.},

abstract = {Chat-log data is a little used resource for analyzing human communication in social networks. Some statements in this data do not include the intended username of a receiver or any variant of it, and thus are termed "misaddressed statements". Constructing social networks from such a semi-structured data and subsequent analyzing require a reliable process to make sure that the social network representation is as truthful as possible. Due to the large size of data, human assignment of statements to receivers is prohibitive. In this paper, we present and evaluate different methods to reliably predict a receiver for these misaddressed statements. We use a set of prediction rules which follow human communication behavior in a group chat and we show their success in constructing social networks.},

abstract = {This paper considers an approach to identify previously undetected malicious clients in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks by combining flow classification with a graph-based score propagation method. Our approach represents all HTTP communications between clients and servers as a weighted, near-bipartite graph, where the nodes correspond to the IP addresses of clients and servers while the links are their interconnections, weighted according to the output of a flow-based classifier. We employ a two-phase alternating score propagation algorithm on the graph to identify suspicious clients in a monitored network. Using a symmetrized weighted adjacency matrix as its input, we show that our score propagation algorithm is less vulnerable towards inflating the malicious scores of popular Web servers with high in-degrees compared to the normalization used in PageRank, a widely used graph-based method. Experimental results on a 4-hour network trace collected by a large Internet service provider showed that incorporating flow information into score propagation significantly improves the precision of the algorithm.},

abstract = {To describe the dynamics taking place in networks that structurally change over time, we propose an approach to search for attributes whose value changes impact the topology of the graph. In several applications, it appears that the variations of a group of attributes are often followed by some structural changes in the graph that one may assume they generate. We formalize the triggering pattern discovery problem as a method jointly rooted in sequence mining and graph analysis. We apply our approach on three real-world dynamic graphs of different natures - a co-authoring network, an airline network, and a social bookmarking system - assessing the relevancy of the triggering pattern mining approach.},

Such big social bipartite graphs are often very skewed and unbalanced, on which traditional indexing algorithms do not perform optimally. In this paper, we propose Arowana, a data-driven algorithm for indexing large unbalanced bipartite graphs. Arowana achieves a high-performance efficiency by building an index tree that incorporates the semantic affinity among unbalanced graphs. Arowana uses probabilistic data structures to minimize space overhead and optimize search. In the experiments, we show that Arowana exhibits significant performance improvements and reduces space overhead over traditional indexing techniques.},

abstract = {Dynamics on and of networks are two basic processes that drive coevolving networks such as online social networks. The paper investigates the mechanism of coevolving networks using a generalized adaptive voter model based on related work and the homophily principle which is known as a driving mechanism to form community structure in social networks. The proposed model has mechanisms for dynamics on and of coevolving networks, which are node state change via social interactions and link rewiring based on homophily. The numerical simulation of the proposed model reveals that there exists two phase transitions for the parameters adaptability and homophily. This observation implies that the nature of the homophily principle lies in the adaptive mechanism in the proposed model.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The research on community structure is a key to analyze the network functionality and topology, and thus it is significant to detect and analysis the community structure. During the abstract process from an actual system to a network, especially for a large-scale network, it is inevitable to have mistaken connections between nodes or have connection missing. In addition, in real applications, from time to time we can obtain prior information in the form of pairwise constraints between nodes besides topology information, although they may be inaccurate or conflicted. These noises in the network-related information will dramatically reduce the accuracy of community detection. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a dissimilarity index to determine the trustworthiness of pairwise constraints and settle the conflict of pairwise constraints. Then, focusing on the community detection with false connections or conflicted connections, we propose a pairwise constrained structure-enhanced extremal optimization-based semi-supervised algorithm (PCSEO-SS algorithm). Compared with existing semi-supervised community detection approaches, the experimental results executed on real networks and synthetic networks, show that PCSEO-SS can solve the problem of false connections or conflicted connections to some extent and detect the community structure more precisely.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Most of overlapping community detection algorithms cannot be applied to networks with highly overlapping community such as online social networks where individuals belong to many communities. One important reason is that many algorithms detect communities based on the explicit borders where nodes have more connections inside the communities, however, when the vertices' membership number gets large, the explicit borders between communities will fade away. To overcome this disadvantage, a new algorithm named MCNLPA is proposed by expanding the traditional Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) based on the Maximal Clique Network for highly overlapping community detection. By finding all maximal cliques in networks and defining reasonable edges between them, the maximal clique network is established. Then the updated rule of classic LPA is modified to apply to the maximal network. Experiments show that MCNLPA has a relatively good performance in highly overlapping community detection and overlapping nodes identification.},

abstract = {Community detection is an important task in social network analysis. It aims to partition the network into clusters so that interactions among members within a cluster are considerably more frequent than that across clusters. A typical instantiation is to maximize the modularity of clusters which is a NP-hard problem, and thus, heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms are employed as approximation. We present a novel divisive algorithm based on ant colony optimization to detect hierarchical community structure by maximizing the modularity. Our algorithm splits the network into two local communities iteratively and incorporates both heuristic information and pheromone trails. Experimental results on a set of synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks verified that our algorithm is highly effective for hierarchical community structure detection.},

abstract = {Reblogging, also known as retweeting in Twitter parlance, is a major type of activities in many online social networks. Although there are many studies on reblogging behaviors and potential applications, whether neighbors who are well connected with each other (called "buddies" in our study) may make a difference in reblog likelihood has not been examined systematically. In this paper, we tackle the problem by conducting a systematic statistical study on a large SINA Weibo data set, which is a sample of 135, 859 users, 10, 129, 028 followers, and 2,296,290,930 reblog messages in total. To the best of our knowledge, this data set has more reblog messages than any data sets reported in literature. We examine a series of hypotheses about how essential neighborhood structures may help to boost the likelihood of reblogging, including buddy neighbors versus buddyless neighbors, traffic between buddy neighbors, activeness (i.e., the total number of blog messages a user sends), and the number of buddy triangles a user participates in. Our empirical study discloses several interesting phenomena that are not reported in literature, which may imply interesting and valuable new applications.},

abstract = {Network based recommendation systems leverage the topology of the underlying graph and the current user context to rank objects in the database. Random-walk based techniques, such as PageRank, encode the structure of the graph in the form of a transition matrix of a stochastic process from which the significances of the nodes in the graph are inferred. Personalized PageRank (PPR) techniques complement this with a seed node set which serves as the personalization context. In this paper, we note (and experimentally show) that PPR algorithms that do not differentiate among the seed nodes may not properly rank nodes in situations where the seed set is incomplete and/or noisy. To tackle this problem, we propose alternative robust personalized PageRank (RPR) strategies, which are insensitive to noise in the set of seed nodes and in which the rankings are not overly biased towards the seed nodes. In particular, we show that novel teleportation discounting and seed-set maximal PPR techniques help eliminate harmful bias of individual seed nodes and provide effective seed differentiation to lead to more accurate rankings.},

In these massive tweets, different user interests and daily trends are reflected by different topics. While to our best knowledge, a systematic investigation of topic dynamics in Weibo is still missing. Aiming at filling this vital gap, we try to disclose the evolving patterns of topics from the perspective of time, geography, gender, emotion and interaction. First, an incremental learning framework is established to classify more than 200 million tweets into seven topics fast and accurately, whose F-measure arrives as high as 84%. Second, many interesting patterns in topic dynamics are revealed. For instance, happy Entertainment accounts for over half of the tweets and angry Finance possesses the most significant periodic pattern. Besides, the female and male users prefer different topics and Finance shows a surprisingly high correlation between connected users. Finally, our findings could provide insights for the topic-related applications in social media, like event detection or content recommendation.},

abstract = {Study of reciprocity helps to find influential factors for users building relationships, which greatly facilitates the social behavior understanding in trust networks. In the previous literature, the dynamics of both network structure and user generated content are rarely considered. Our investigation of the available timing information from a real-world network demonstrates that time delay has significant impact on reciprocity formation. In particular, we find structural factors possess greater effect on short-term reciprocity while factors based on user generated content become more important for long-term reciprocity. Based on the empirical analysis, we redefine the reciprocity prediction problem as a learning task specific to each pair of users with different reciprocal delays. Evaluations show that our time-aware framework eventually outperforms the conventional classifiers that ignore the temporal information. Meanwhile, we tackle the problem of concept drift through fitting the evolving trend of features for Naive Bayes and performing periodic retraining for Logistic Regression classifiers, respectively.},

By applying social network analysis techniques, we attempt to detect the birth of two new gangs based on local features (modularity, cliques) and global features (clustering coefficient). Thus for the future, identifying the changes in these can help us identify the possible birth of new gangs (sub-networks) in the social system. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of these networks globally and locally, and have identified the global characteristics that tell us that they are not random graphs - they are small world graphs - implying that the formation of gangs is not a random event. However, we are not yet able to conclude anything significant about scale-free characteristics due to insufficient sample size.},

abstract = {Detecting review spam is important for current e-commerce applications. However, the posted order of review has been neglected by the former work. In this paper, we explore the issue on fake review detection in review sequence, which is crucial for implementing online anti-opinion spam. We analyze the characteristics of fake reviews firstly. Based on review contents and reviewer behaviors, six time sensitive features are proposed to highlight the fake reviews. And then, we devise supervised solutions and a threshold-based solution to spot the fake reviews as early as possible. The experimental results show that our methods can identify the fake reviews orderly with high precision and recall.},

abstract = {This work tries to bring a marriage between two areas of computer science, social network analysis and machine learning, by exploiting ranking-based learning models for preference prediction on social networks. In the field of social network analysis, the diffusion of information on social networks has been studied for decades. This paper proposes the study of diffusion of preference on social networks. In general, there are two types of approaches proposed to predict the diffusion of information on a network, model-driven and data-driven approaches. The former assumes an underlying mechanism for diffusion while the latter tries to learn a more flexible model with the given data. This paper first proposes a simple modification on the existing model-driven binary diffusion approaches for preference list diffusion, and then addresses some concerns by proposing a rank-learning based data-driven approach. To evaluate the approaches, we propose two scenarios which data can be obtained from publicly available sources, namely predicting the preference propagation about the citation behavior and the microblogging behavior. The experiments show that the proposed ranking-based data-driven method outperforms all the other competitors significantly in both evaluation scenarios.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of learning the information diffusion probabilities when there is no sufficient data of information diffusion. By observing the information diffusion behavior on the popular social network web-site Twitter, we find that the evidence of information diffusion is extremely sparse. Less than one percent of tweets are retweeted, which is considered as the most important form of information diffusion evidence on Twitter. Previous research on predicting information diffusion probabilities has failed under such scenarios because the problem of over fitting. To overcome this problem, we first propose to use the variance of the diffusion probabilities as a measure of model complexity for the independent cascade model. After that, we propose two regularization schemes to reduce model complexity. The first scheme is based on regularizing the variance of the diffusion probabilities directly. The second scheme is based on regularizing the mean absolute deviation of the logarithm of the diffusion probabilities. We are able to derive an approximation solution for the first scheme and analytical solution to the second scheme. We conduct experiments by simulating information diffusion on six social network datasets. Experimental results show that the variance regularization scheme outperforms the baseline by a noticeable margin. The mean absolute deviation regularization scheme is better than the baseline.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are the fundamental processes often taking place in networks. The problem of devising a strategy to facilitate or block such process has received a considerable amount of attention. A major challenge therein is that the underlying network of diffusion is often hidden. Most researchers dealing with this issue assume only one underlying network over which cascades spread. However, in the real world, whether the transmission pathways of a contagion, a piece of information, emerge or not depends on many factors, such as the topic of the information and the time when the information is first mentioned. In our opinion, it is impractical to model the diffusion processes by using only a single network when information is of all kind and diffuses in different underlying topic-specific networks. In this paper, we formulate a problem of K-network inference, inferring K underlying diffusion networks, based on a proposed probabilistic generative mixture model that models the generation of cascades. We further propose an algorithm that could cluster similar cascades and infer the corresponding underlying network for each cluster in the Expectation-Maximization framework. Finally, in experiments, we show that our algorithm could cluster cascades and infer the underlying networks effectively.},

From the micro perspective, we investigate individual diffusion. We adopt Edelman's "topology of influence" theory to identify four type of users with different influence levels in diffusion based on their dynamic retweet behaviors.

abstract = {A social role is a special position an individual possesses within a network, which indicates his or her behaviours, expectations, and responsibilities. Identifying the roles that individuals play in a social network has various direct applications, such as detecting influential members, trustworthy people, idea innovators, etc. Roles can also be used for further analyses of the network, e.g. community detection, temporal event prediction, and summarization. In this paper, we propose a structural social role mining framework (SSRM), which is built to identify roles, study their changes, and analyze their impacts on the underlying social network. We define fundamental roles in a social network (namely leader, outermost, mediator, and outsider), and then propose methodologies to identify them, and track their changes. To identify these roles, we leverage the traditional social network analyses and metrics, as well as proposing new measures, including community-based variants for the Betweenness centrality. Our results indicate how the changes in the structural roles, in combination with the changes in the community structure of a network, can provide additional clues into the dynamics of networks.},

We derive automatic ways of classifying the viewcount curve into one of these models and of extracting the most suitable parameters of the model. We study empirically the impact of videos' popularity and category on the evolution of its viewcount. We finally use the above classification along with the automatic parameters extraction in order to predict the evolution of videos' viewcount.},

abstract = {Many complex systems, from World Wide Web and online social networks to mobile networks, exhibit community structure in which nodes can be grouped into densely interconnected communities. This special structure has been exploited extensively to design better solutions for many operations and applications such as routing in wireless networks, worm containment and interest prediction in social networks. The outcome of these solutions are sensitive to the network structures, which raises an important question: can communities be broken easily in a network? To answer this question, we introduce a density-based problem formulation for analyzing the vulnerability of communities. Our approach includes the NP-completeness and a O(log k) approximation algorithm for solving the problem where k is the number of communities to be broken. Additionally, we analyze the vulnerability of communities in the context of arbitrary community detection algorithms. The empirical results show that communities are vulnerable to edge removal and in some cases the removal of a small fraction of edges can break the community structure.},

abstract = {The research on community question answering (CQA) has been paid increasing attention in recent years. In CQA, to reduce the number of unanswered questions and the time for askers to wait, it is very necessary to identify relevant experts or best answers for these questions. Generally, the experts' answers are more likely to be the best answers. Existing studies considered that user expertise is reflected by the voting scores of both answers and questions. However, voting scores of questions are not really related to user expertise. In this paper, we proposed a new probabilistic model to depict users' expertise based on answers and their descriptive ability based on questions. To exploit social information in CQA, the link analysis is also considered. Extensive experiments on the large Stack Overflow dataset demonstrate that our methods can achieve comparable or even better performance than the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Given a newly posted question on a Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) site, how long will it take until an answer is received? Does response time relate to factors about how the question asker composes their question? If so, what are those factors? With advances in social media and the Web, Q&amp;A sites have become a major source of information for Internet users. Response time of a question is an important aspect in these sites as it is associated with the users' satisfaction and engagement, and thus the lifespan of these online communities. In this paper we study and estimate response time for questions in StackOverflow, a popular online Q&amp;A forum where software developers post and answer questions related to programming. We analyze a long list of factors in the data and identify those that have clear relation with response time. Our key finding is that tag-related factors, such as their "popularity" (how often the tag is used) and the number of their "subscribers" (how many users can answer questions containing the tag), provide much stronger evidence than factors not related to tags. Finally, we learn models using the identified evidential features for predicting the response time of questions, which also demonstrate the significance of tags chosen by the question asker.},

Because of the various users of the CQA service, question search and ranking are the most important topics of research in the CQA portal. In this study, we addressed the problem of identifying questions as being hard or easy by means of a probability model. In addition, we observed the phenomenon called knowledge gap that is related to the habit of users and used a knowledge gap diagram to illustrate how much of a knowledge gap exists in different categories. To this end, we proposed an approach called the knowledge-gap-based difficulty rank (KG-DRank) algorithm, which combines the user-user network and the architecture of the CQA service to find hard questions. We used f-measure, AUC, MAP, NDCG, precision@Top5 and concordance analysis to evaluate the experimental results. Our results show that our approach leads to better performance than other baseline approaches across all evaluation metrics.},

Our key observation is that the voting score of an answer is strongly positively correlated with that of its question, and such correlation could be in turn used to boost the prediction performance. Armed with this observation, we propose a family of algorithms to jointly predict the voting scores of questions and answers soon after they are posted in the CQA sites.

Promoting the general awareness of the disorder, increasing the engagement with the affected individuals and their carers, and understanding the success of penetration of the current clinical recommendations in the target communities, is crucial in driving research as well as policy. The aim of the present work is to investigate if Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information exchange, can be used as a data-mining source which could aid in the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, using a large data set of harvested tweets, we present a series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects of messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of their nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate additional research on this topic and present a methodological basis for further work.},

Twitter, as the most important microblogging service, is often in the focus of these works, as it offers free access to big volumes of data. The free access, on that many publications rely, is composed of a random subset of the complete public status stream. Publications rely particularly on the uniform distribution of tweets in this sample stream, and therefore, till today, one has to trust in the statement of Twitter that the sample data is indeed uniformly distributed1. In our research on the technical properties of Twitter's streaming data, we found evidence for discovering the method used by Twitter to decide which tweets will show up in the random sample streams.A deeper insight into this process leads to the possible reasons of why Twitter chose the presented sampling method. For this purpose we provide an overview of how Twitter's unique tweet IDs are generated and explain the regularities of each part of a tweet ID. This results also in some information about the tweet ID generating infrastructure of Twitter and what kind of knowledge can possibly be derived from small features like the tweet ID.},

Positivity and negativity of a person are two important attributes of emotion and mood. Social media is a very important platform from which we can glean the positivity and negativity attributes of a user based on his/her message postings and interactions with other users. In this paper, we study and analyze a Twitter dataset of more than 130,000 users to understand the nature of their positivity and negativity attributes. We measure behavioral attributes by sentiment analysis relating to social personal concern and psychological process. We observe that social media contains useful behavioral cues to classify users into positive and negative groups based on network density and degree of social activity either in information sharing or emotional interaction and social awareness. We believe that our findings will be useful in developing tools for predicting positive and negative users and help provide the best recommendation towards helping negative users through online social media.},

abstract = {In the context of Twitter, social capitalists are users trying to increase their number of followers and interactions by any means. They are not healthy for the service, because they introduce a bias in the way user influence and visibility are perceived. Understanding their behavior and position in the network is thus of important interest. In this work, we propose to do so by focusing on the community structure level. We first extend an existing method based on the notion of community role, on three different points: 1) handling of directed networks, 2) more precise modeling of the community-related connectivity and 3) unsupervised role identification. We then take advantage of an existing tool to detect social capitalists, and apply our method to analyze their organization and how their links spread across the network. The specific community roles they hold in the network let us know that they reach to obtain high visibility.},

abstract = {The ever-growing number of people using Twitter makes it a valuable source of timely information. However, detecting events in Twitter is a difficult task, because tweets that report interesting events are overwhelmed by a large volume of tweets on unrelated topics. Existing methods focus on the textual content of tweets and ignore the social aspect of Twitter. In this paper we propose MABED (Mention-Anomaly-Based Event Detection), a novel method that leverages the creation frequency of dynamic links (i.e. mentions) that users insert in tweets to detect important events and estimate the magnitude of their impact over the crowd. The main advantages of MABED over prior works are that (i) it relies solely on tweets, meaning no external knowledge is required, and that (ii) it dynamically estimates the period of time during which each event is discussed rather than assuming a predefined fixed duration. The experiments we conducted on both English and French Twitter data show that the mention-anomaly-based approach leads to more accurate event detection and improved robustness in presence of noisy Twitter content. Last, we show that MABED helps with the interpretation of detected events by providing clear and precise descriptions.},

abstract = {Over the past decade Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been helping hundreds of millions of people develop reliable computer-mediated relations. However, many user profiles in OSNs contain misleading, inconsistent or false information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread, often for protecting a user's privacy. In order for OSNs to continue expanding their role as a communication medium in our society, it is crucial for information posted on OSNs to be trusted. Here we define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders in Twitter. In addition, we report empirical results with our stratified data set consisting of 174,600 Twitter profiles with a 50--50 breakdown between male and female users.Our automated approach compares gender indicators obtained from different profile characteristics including first name, user name, and layout colors. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator and the strength of all possible values for each indicator through extensive experimentations with our data set. We define male trending users and female trending users based on two factors, namely the overall accuracy of each characteristic and the relative strength of the value of each characteristic for a given user. We apply a Bayesian classifier to the weighted average of characteristics for each user. We flag for possible deception profiles that we classify as male or female in contrast with a self-declared gender that we obtain independently of Twitter profiles. Finally, we use manual inspections on a subset of profiles that we identify as potentially deceptive in order to verify the correctness of our predictions.},

abstract = {Users in social networks use hashtags for various reasons, some of them being serving search purposes, gaining attention or popularity or starting new conversation - thus, creating viral memes. In this paper we address the problem of classifying these hashtags in different categories, based on whether they represent a real life event or a social network generated meme. We compute a set of language-agnostic features to aid the classification of hashtags into events and memes and we provide an extensive study of the behavior that characterizes memes and events. We focus on Twitter social network, we apply our methods on a big dataset and reveal interesting characteristics of the two classes of hashtags.},

abstract = {A variety of event detection algorithms for microblog services have been proposed, but their accuracy relies on the microblog feeds they analyse. Existing research explores datasets that are collected using either a set of manually predefined terms or information from external sources. These methods fail to provide comprehensive and quality feeds for real-time event detection. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive keyword identification approach to retrieve a greater amount of event relevant content. This approach continuously monitors emerging hashtags and rates them by their similarity to specific pre-defined event hashtags using TF-IDF vectors. Top rated emerging hashtags are added as filter criteria in real time. By comparing our proposed approach, called CETRe (Content-based Event Tweet Retrieval) with an existing baseline approach applied to real-world events, we show that CETRe not only identifies event topics and contents, but also enables better event detection.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a topic-based method to reflect calls and proximities simultaneously into finding interaction patterns from a mobile log. For this purpose, the proposed method regards calls and proximities as a homogeneous information type that are drawn from the same temporal space expressed by the same distribution, but with different parameters. The number of proximities in a mobile log usually overwhelms that of calls and the proximities are observed regularly. Therefore, the proposed method models a single directional influence from proximities to calls, where both call and proximity are modeled by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). According to the experiments on the data set from MIT's Reality Mining project, the proposed method outperforms the method that treats calls and proximities independently, which proves the plausibility of the proposed method.},

In comparison to related approaches that infer templates by clustering generic pages, we do not rely on a manual annotated training set. Instead, we use the feeds and their linked articles as training set to identify characteristic XPaths. Those paths identify the exact article content and article properties like title, author and publishing date.Further, we can use those paths to detect article pages that are no longer linked from feeds. We show the precision gain by comparing the article content extraction with an alternative approach e.g. boilerplate.},

abstract = {The Syria conflict has been described as the most socially mediated in history, with online social media playing a particularly important role. At the same time, the ever-changing landscape of the conflict leads to difficulties in applying analytical approaches taken by other studies of online political activism. Therefore, in this paper, we use an approach that does not require strong prior assumptions or the proposal of an advance hypothesis to analyze Twitter and YouTube activity of a range of protagonists to the conflict, in an attempt to reveal additional insights into the relationships between them. By means of a network representation that combines multiple data views, we uncover communities of accounts falling into four categories that broadly reflect the situation on the ground in Syria. A detailed analysis of selected communities within the antiregime categories is provided, focusing on their central actors, preferred online platforms, and activity surrounding "real world" events. Our findings indicate that social media activity in Syria is considerably more convoluted than reported in many other studies of online political activism, suggesting that alternative analytical approaches can play an important role in this type of scenario.},

abstract = {In social networking services (SNSs), persistent topics are extremely rare and valuable. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the detection of persistent topics in SNSs based on Topic Graph. A topic graph is a subgraph of the ordinary social network graph that consists of the users who shared a certain topic up to some time point. Based on the assumption that the time-evolutions of the topic graphs associated with a persistent and non-persistent topics are different, we propose to detect persistent topics by performing anomaly detection on the feature values extracted from the time-evolution of the topic graph. For anomaly detection, we use principal component analysis to capture the subspace spanned by normal (non-persistent) topics. We demonstrate our technique on a real data set we gathered from Twitter and show that it performs significantly better than a base-line method based on power law curve fitting and the linear influence model.},

abstract = {Online marketing exploits social influence to trigger chain-like cascades. However, recent practices actively employ agents to collaboratively inflate the spreading of influences. Through supporting structures, they help each other with false feedback and signals to attract other users in the spreading process and thus alter the spontaneous social dynamics. In this paper, we proposed a modeling framework to explain the mechanism of such operations and characterize the spreading dynamics. Model analytics and numerical simulations both showed a lifting in overall spreading influence. As empirical evidence, experiments on a large Weibo network revealed well-structured advertising groups that prominently amplified the influences of promoted commercials via meticulous cooperation in a core-peripheral structure. The inflation effect also brings new considerations into influence maximization problems. Based on our models, we solved the problem of maximizing inflated influence by optimizing the selection of agents under KKT conditions and their supporting structure using its submodular property.},

In this paper, we propose a new perspective for key player identification, based on optimizing multiple objectives of interest, and illustrate its applicability. In addition we propose an algorithm to select the most suitable sets of key players when the user can identify a subset of objectives as important.

abstract = {Understanding how information flows in online social networks is of great importance. It is generally difficult to obtain accurate prediction results of cascades over such networks, therefore a variety of diffusion models have been proposed in the literature to simulate diffusion processes instead. We argue that such models require extensive simulation results to produce good estimates of future spreads. In this work, we take a complimentary approach. We present a generalized, analytical model of influence in social networks that captures social influence at various levels of granularity, ranging from pairwise influence, to local neighborhood, to the general population, and external events, therefore capturing the complex dynamics of human behavior. We demonstrate that our model can integrate a variety of diffusion models. Particularly, we show that commonly used diffusion models in social networks can be reduced to special cases of our model, by carefully defining their parameters. Our goal is to provide a closed-form expression to approximate the probability of infection for every node in an arbitrary, directed network at any time t. We quantitatively evaluate the approximation quality of our analytical solution as compared to numerous popular diffusion models on a real-world dataset and a series of synthetic graphs.},

abstract = {For better viral marketing, there has been a lot of research on social influence maximization. However, the problem that who is influenced and how diverse the influenced population is, which is important in real-world marketing, has largely been neglected. To that end, in this paper, we propose to consider the magnitude of influence and the diversity of the influenced crowd simultaneously. Specifically, we formulate it as an optimization problem, i.e., diversified social influence maximization. First, we present a general framework for this problem, under which we construct a class of diversity measures to quantify the diversity of the influenced crowd. Meanwhile, we prove that a simple greedy algorithm guarantees to provide a near-optimal solution to the optimization problem. Furthermore, we relax the problem by focusing on the diversity of the nodes targeted for initial activation, and show how this relaxed form could be used to diversify the results of many heuristics, e.g., PageRank. Finally, we run extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, showing that our formulation is effective in generating diverse results.},

abstract = {Far beyond relationship topology, today's online social networks are also characterized by semantically rich text messages exchanged among users as well as GPS locations associated with those messages, as evidenced by Twitter's geo-tagged tweets. Textual contents help characterize users' personal interests, while geographical features help link users' behaviors in the online world to those in the physical world such as their mobility patterns. In this paper, instead of studying each aspect separately, as done by most previous works, we combine textual contents and spatial features in a joint way using Bayesian latent topic model in order to construct better algorithms for user characterization and social network study. Specifically, the integration of contents and spatial features in a user-centered environment can not only discover geographic topics but also enable the characterization of users' latent interests with geographic semantics. Such a novel characterization can be leveraged to benefit many interesting studies regarding social network heterogeneity and relationships between online networks and physical world. Using a large-scale twitter data set with broad geographical coverage, we systematically evaluate our framework in several typical inference tasks surrounding user, content and location, as well as carry out empirical studies in real world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our joint modeling approach, as well as its potentials to facilitate user understanding, both in online world and physical world.},

Studies conclude that crime does not occur uniformly across urban landscapes but concentrates in certain areas. This phenomenon has drawn attention to spatial crime analysis, primarily focusing on crime hotspots, areas with disproportionally higher crime density. In this paper we present CrimeTracer, a personalized random walk based approach to spatial crime analysis and crime location prediction outside of hotspots. We propose a probabilistic model of spatial behavior of known offenders within their activity space. Crime Pattern Theory concludes that offenders, rather than venture into unknown territory, frequently commit opportunistic crimes and serial violent crimes by taking advantage of opportunities they encounter in places they are most familiar with as part of their activity space. Our experiments on a large real-world crime dataset show that CrimeTracer outperforms all other methods used for location recommendation we evaluate here.},

These metrics show that users with different relationships demonstrate significantly different co-locating patterns. With these metrics as features, we adopt supervised approach to classify cellphone user pairs into different relationship categories.

We identify the social features from three types of the users' information - demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), social relations (i.e., friendship), and users' interests. The results reveal that the interest similarity follows the homophily principle. Particularly, the results show that two users are more likely to be alike in their interests 1) if they exhibit more similarity in their demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, same gender, or close to each other geographically), or 2) if they are more intimate in their friendship, or 3) if they present a higher average interest individuality (i.e., a measurement for estimating the personalized characteristics of a user's interests). The empirical observations could be exploited to infer how two users are alike in their interests according to the social features, which could be further harnessed by various practical applications and services, such as recommendation system and advertisement service.},

Due to the complexity of rumor spreading and the radical emotion infecting processes, the results of the group emotion evolution analysis often lose effectiveness, which will affect the control and strategy establishment in emergency management. In this paper, we study the group emotion evolution process with the agent based simulation method. Along the way, the events-chain model is proposed to modeling the over-lapping influence of the temporal successive events. The simulation experiments of correlation events and events-chain model of a real public incident are performed based on the constructed framework. The results show that the group emotion evolution processes of correlation events have different patterns with the single event, and they cannot analyze as two independent events. Meanwhile, the results of real incident show that the events-chain model can simulate the real group response with consistency of the evolution.},

abstract = {Classical machine learning techniques assume the data to be i.i.d., but the real world data is inherently relational and can generally be represented using graphs or some variants of a graph representation. The importance of modeling relational data is evident from its increasing presence in many domains: Telecom networks, WWW, social networks, organizational networks, images, protein sequences, etc. This field has recently been receiving a lot of attention in various communities under different themes depending on the problem addressed and the nature of solution proposed. Collective classification is one such popular approach which involves the use of a local classifier that embeds the node's own attributes and neighbors' information in a feature vector, and classifies the nodes in an iterative procedure. Despite the increasing popularity, there is not much attention paid towards datasets with multiple attributes and multi-relational (MAMR) networks under multi-label scenarios. In MAMR data, nodes can be represented using multiple types of attributes (attribute views) and there are multiple link types between the nodes. For example, in Twitter, users can be represented using their tweets, urls shared, hashtags and list memberships. And different Twitter users can be connected using follower, followed by and re-tweet links. Secondly, in many networks, nodes are associated with more than one label. For instance, Twitter users can be tagged with one or more labels from a set L, where L contains various movie genres that a user might like. Motivated by this, we propose a learning technique for multi-label collective classification using multiple attribute views on multi-relational network data which captures complex label correlations within and across attribute/relationship types. We empirically evaluate our proposed approach on Twitter and MovieLens datasets, and we show that it performs better than the state-of-art approaches.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning has attracted an increasing attention from many domains, because of its great potential applications. Although many learning methods have been witnessed, two major challenges are still not handled very well. They are the correlations and the high dimensionality of data. In this paper, we exploit the inherent property of the multi-label data and propose an effective sparse multi-label learning algorithm. Specifically, it handles the high-dimensional multi-label data by using a regularized partial least squares discriminant analysis with a l1-norm penalty. Consequently, the proposed method can not only capture the label correlations effectively, but also perform the operation of dimensionality reduction at the same time. The experimental results conducted on eight public data sets show that our method is promising and outperformed the state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers in most cases.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Modularity is a widely used measure for evaluating community structure in networks. The definition of modularity involves a comparison between the observed network and a null model, which serves as a reference. To make the comparison significant, this null model should characterize some features of the observed network. However, the previously used null models are not good representations of real-world networks. A common feature of many real-world networks is similarity attraction, i.e., nodes that are similar have a higher chance of getting connected. We propose a new null model that captures this feature. Based on our null model, we create a unified measure Dist-Modularity, which incorporates the famous Newman-Girvan modularity as a special case. We use three examples to demonstrate that Dist-Modularity is useful in detecting 1) the multi-resolution communities and 2) the geographically dispersed communities.},

abstract = {For the past decades, people combine both environmental learnings (observations) and social learnings (intercommunication links) in their decision process. People in the communities face limitations or conditions which have effects on their decisions. In this paper, we present a multigenerational social learning model to analyse a world with some limitations. Then we turn the world to a free world and people try to find correct decisions utilizing these changes. In the presented model, people make their initial decisions based on sequential decision model which leads them into the herd behavior. Then we change the world so that making connections with other communities is possible. We show how aggregate welfare will be improved when people use their observations, their new obtained information on social ties and their personality factors to review their current decisions. We also have a parameter in our model that examines the effect of personality factor value on the percentage of the correct decision among the communities. Our main results show when people use their obtained information rather than sticking to the herd behavior, the aggregate welfare will be better in the world, even if people use only their own observations.},

We propose a series of progressively more sophisticated machine learning models, culminating in a Markov Random Field model that utilizes the text content in social media as well as the spatiotemporal correlation among cities and days. Our extensive experiments on Sina Weibo data from 108 cities during a one-month period demonstrate the accurate AQI prediction performance of our approach.},

Specifically, we consider both local and global trustworthiness of target users, and form a personalized trust metric by further taking into account the active user's propensity to trust.

abstract = {With the explosive growth of online social network services such as Facebook and Twitter, people now are providing ample opportunities to share information, ideas, and innovations among others. Studying social influence and information diffusion in online social networks can be extremely useful for various real-life applications, notably influencer marketing and viral marketing. Influence maximization problem, motivated by viral marketing applications, has received extensive attentions from social network analysis community in recent years. The goal of the problem is to find a small set of k seed nodes in a social network that maximize the influence spread under certain influence propagation models.Based on the widely adopted Independent Cascade model, a Persuasiveness Aware Cascade (PAC) model which considers social persuasion in influence propagation is proposed. In this model, the user-to-user influence probability is estimated by three types of social persuasion, namely, tie strength, peer conformity, and authority. Experiments conducted over real-world social networks suggest that the proposed model with the new social persuasion measures is more effective in describing real-world influence propagation than the well-studied propagation models for influence maximization.},

abstract = {Community detection and influence analysis are significant notions in social networks. We exploit the implicit knowledge of influence-based connectivity and proximity encoded in the network topology, and propose a novel algorithm for both community detection and influence ranking. Using a new influence cascade model, the algorithm generates an influence vector for each node, which captures in detail how the node's influence is distributed through the network. Similarity in this influence space defines a new, meaningful and refined connectivity measure for the closeness of any pair of nodes. Our approach not only differentiates the influence ranking but also effectively finds communities in both undirected and directed networks, and incorporates these two important tasks into one integrated framework. We demonstrate its superior performance with extensive tests on a set of real-world networks and synthetic benchmarks.},

Social network analysis provides socio-metric measures of leadership, which can be associated with traditional measures of leadership. The research evaluates U.S. Military cadets' social networks of friendship, trust, and reputed leadership in concert with leadership attributes, organizational identity, and attitude. The significance of reputed leaders' social position is ascertained. Additionally, the channels and extent of influence of reputed d leaders over other cadets are assessed. A significant result was that leaders are not spreading their influence over the friendship network but over the leadership reputation network. Leaders have a particular influence on those who perceive them as leaders when it comes to leadership style and performance. This result contributes to our knowledge of "social leadership", in particular, the ability to manage the social dynamics inherent in leadership.},

In social networks, the interactions among users are very frequent by sending emails, posting tweets, and sharing comments online, etc. Such networks usually include rich sentiment information, which can provide us with useful resources for identifying communities with different sentiment-topic distributions. Most conventional community discovery methods only consider the social links among users, which ignore the valuable content information. Recent studies have focused on community detection by integrating both links and content. However, most of these methods are not available for identifying sentiment-topic based communities. In this paper, we propose two novel community discovery models by combining social links, author based topics and sentiment information to identify communities with different sentiment-topic distributions.

With this goal, this paper presents a novel method to formalize the textual content of job offers that aims at identifying the most relevant information and fields expressed by them and leverage this compact formalization for job recommendation and profile matching in social network environments. This method has been then developed and tested in the industrial environment represented by Multiposting and Work4, world leaders in digital solutions of e-recruitment problems.In this study three classes of documents are considered: job offers, job categories and social network user profiles (as potential job candidates); each class contains several fields with textual information. The proposed representation method permits to dynamically identify those text fields, for each class, that could help a cross-matching strategy in order to preserve, from one hand, the matching/recommendation performances and, on the other hand, reduce the cost of these operations (due to a straightforward dimensionality reduction mechanism).We then evaluated and compared the presented approach showing significant improvements on both categorization and recommendation tasks by also drastically reducing their computational costs.},

It naturally consists of two subtasks, namely, fine-grained entity classification and entity linking. Existing studies often focus on one of these two subtasks and they usually populate entity mentions in the same text by implicitly assuming that they are independent. However, these entity mentions are often semantically related to each other and it would be better to populate them into the knowledge base collectively. For solving these problems, in this paper we propose an interdependence graph based and unified collective inference approach, called CIIGA, to populating a knowledge base with collective entities, which can jointly determine the proper locations of all entity mentions in the same text by exploiting their interdependence relationships. Experimental results show that this approach can achieve significant accuracy improvement, as compared to the baseline approach, APOLLO, on the task of knowledge base population with multiple entities.},

In our work, we take the personalized paper recommendation as a ranking problem with respect to users' research interests, and employ a supervised learning to rank approach to solve the problem. However, most previous learning to rank methods rely on manually labeled training data which are both expensive and limited in size. We propose automatical training data construction by mining the existing large scale academic network, and extract various heterogeneous features for learning. With the learned model, we conduct real time personalized recommendation based on our novel efficient candidate generation approach. In addition, update recommendation is employed to interact with users according to different types of user feedbacks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by both offline and online evaluation.},

abstract = {Causal inference from observational data rely on similar treatment and control groups to isolate for variation, in addition to adjustments in estimates to account for the remaining uncontrollable variation. Propensity score matching and statistical inference are established tools to achieve for these two requirements respectively. Network structures in the underlying data of the experiment challenge this convention since they question assumptions of independent observations and increase the risk of unobserved variables. In this paper we approach the problem with the intent of preserving propensity score matching and inference, while accommodating network information. Multiple experiments are re-evaluated with network information. All experiments were intended to create organic growth through referrals in a financial services business.We offer first, the Propensity Score Layout; a rapid visualization approach to scan data from multiple studies that potentially may require re-evaluation due to network structure. Second, the Propensity Score Network Risk; a metric that captures the extent to which network structure interferes with the treatment of the experiment. And third; variables constructed from network information that to our surprise estimate the propensity score significantly better than node attributes. We also present a set of interesting problems for researchers in academia and industry. To the best of our knowledge network methods have not been studied thoroughly in this domain. We feel the combination of technique, results and domain are novel.},

abstract = {Monitoring and management of large scale applications is already a complex task because of syntactic and unstructured nature of execution data. Traditional application monitoring and management solutions focused on employing analysis techniques on unstructured and syntactic log information become limited as unstructured information cannot be well utilized to find out related events information or correlate such information with other related information from applications. Our proposed solution of semantically formalized logging fills this gap by bringing formal semantics and combining it in a meaningful way to enable automated monitoring and management of applications. Such formalized and well-structured log information helps analytical solution to maximally automate the process of monitoring and management of applications. However, while formalizing and structuring the log information, we came across several missing and incomplete data which causes hindrance in this process. In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose a social network analysis based solution to handle incomplete and missing data from application execution, possibly compute it and use it by our proposed solution of semantically formalizing and structured logs with adapted data mining techniques to enable automated and effective application monitoring and management. We demonstrate from an industrial use-case application that how historical data from application execution is stored using semantic logging and utilized with standard social-network analysis techniques to find out missing values in incomplete data and perform application monitoring and management.},

title = {Characterizing Emotion Entrainment in Social Media},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The sociological theory of entrainment accounts for the synchronization of human rhythmic modalities through social interactions: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including linguistic styles, facial expressions, music pace, applause, and so on. Though highly relevant, emotion entrainment has received little attention to date. In addition, most previous studies on entrainment are done through small scale or controlled laboratory studies. In this paper, we investigate emotion entrainment in the context of online social media. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that emotion entrainment has been examined on a large scale, real world setting. For this purpose, we propose a framework that can model entrainment phenomenon and measure its effect. Our framework differentiates from previous research by its model-free essential and discerning in entrainment directions. These traits enable us to model entrainment dynamics under few assumptions, and distinguish emotion flow of entrainment. In our studies, we investigate entrainment patterns under different emotion states, i.e. positive, neutral and negative. We discover that entrainments under different emotions all follow a power law distribution. Besides, people are willing to entrain to others under positive emotion, and users with positive emotion are more likely to be entrained. By inspecting the interactions between entrainment and emotion, we reveal that entrainment has an effect of negotiating different emotion types toward an even distribution.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of cascades in Twitter is an important modeling problem with multiple applications like viral marketing and the detection and forecasting of emerging events. Key hashtags rise in popularity to a peak and fall, with profiles characteristic to the specific topical area of the hashtag. Traditional text-based classification approaches are inadequate as new hashtags get created dynamically and because social media vocabulary evolves. We demonstrate a text-free approach SansText to classify emerging cascades by modeling the phenomenological patterns of rise and fall. We illustrate the utility of this approach over several specific event classes as well as more general topics in a collection of more than 2 million tweets from multiple countries of Latin America.},

abstract = {With the coming of the era of big data, it is most urgent to establish the knowledge computational engine for the purpose of discovering implicit and valuable knowledge from the huge, rapidly dynamic, and complex network data. In this paper, we first survey the mainstream knowledge computational engines from four aspects and point out their deficiency. To cover these shortages, we propose the open knowledge network (OpenKN), which is a self-adaptive and evolutionable knowledge computational engine for network big data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of designing the end-to-end and holistic knowledge processing pipeline in regard with the network big data. Moreover, to capture the evolutionable computing capability of OpenKN, we present the evolutionable knowledge network for knowledge representation. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the evolutionable computing of OpenKN.},

abstract = {Organised crime uses information technology systems to communicate, work or expand its influence. The EU FP7 Security Research Project CAPER (Collaborative information, Acquisition, Processing, Exploitation and Reporting for the prevention of organised crime), created in cooperation with European Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), aims to build a common collaborative and information sharing platform for the detection and prevention of organised crime, which exploits Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). LEAs are becoming more inclined to using OSINT tools, and particularly tools able to manage Online Social Networks (OSNs) data. This paper presents the CAPER Facebook crawling and analysis subsystem. Heuristic algorithms have been implemented in order to extract specific properties of Facebook's social graph, in particular user interactions. To support analysis tasks specifically, extensive effort has been spent on the analysis of textual user generated content and on the recognition of named-entities, in particular person names, locations and organisations. Relationships between users and entities mentioned in posts and in related comments are created and merged into the users networks extracted from the social graph. All entity relationships are finally visualised in user-friendly network graphs.},

In this paper, we identify this potential issue on social networks, and develop a theoretical model to analyze related issues. Note that highly-influential "super" users play critical roles on a social network. When they are suddenly unavailable, a large portion of the social network may be seriously disrupted. The proposed model captures this dynamic process and helps us better understand related issues. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed model under four attack strategies based on real social network datasets collected on Twitter and Sina Weibo. We also analyze the connectivity, the persistent time, and the cascade effect of a social network under these attacks. Our results show that social network service providers have to pay closer attention to super users to avoid dramatic failures.},

abstract = {Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are increasingly more reliant on information and communication technologies and affected by a society shaped by the Internet. The richness and quantity of information available from open sources, if properly gathered and processed, can provide valuable intelligence and help in drawing inferences from existing closed source intelligence. Today the intelligence cycle is characterized by manual collection and integration of data. Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a fundamental role in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) solutions when fighting crime. This paper describes the implementation of a NER-based focused web crawler under the EU FP7 Security Research Project CAPER (Collaborative information, Acquisition, Processing, Exploitation and Reporting for the prevention of organized crime). The crawler allows 1. to look for documents starting from a URL until a parametric depth of levels - also specifying a keyword that has to be contained in the page and in the related links - and 2. to look for a parametric number of documents starting from a keyword (entrusting the keyword search to one of the principal search engines, thus behaving as a meta-search engine). In addition, the crawler is able to retrieve only those documents that contain the information semantically relevant to the query (in other words: the required keyword with the required sense). This is achieved through the use of NER technologies. In this paper we present the CAPER NER-based Semantic Crawler, which has been proven to be a suitable tool for focused crawling, allowing LEAs to drastically reduce data collection and integration efforts.},

abstract = {The significance of social media has already been proven in provoking transformation of public opinion for developed countries in improving democratic process of elections. On the contrary, developing countries lacking basic necessities of life possess monopolistic electoral system in which candidates are elected based on tribes, family backgrounds, or landlord influences. They extort voters to cast votes against their promises for the provision of basic needs. Similarly voters also poll votes for personal interests being unaware of party manifesto or national interest. These issues can be addressed by social media, resulting as ongoing process of improvement for presently adopted electoral procedures. People of Pakistan utilized social media to garner support and campaign for political parties in General Elections 2013. Political leaders, parties, and people of Pakistan disseminated party's agenda and advocacy of party's ideology on Twitter without much campaigning cost. To study effectiveness of social media inferred from individual's political behavior, large scale analysis, sentiment detection &amp; tweet classification was done in order to classify, predict and forecast election results. The experimental results depicts that social media content can be used as an effective indicator for capturing political behaviors of different parties Positive, negative and neutral behavior of the party followers as well as party's campaign impact can be predicted from the analysis. The analytical findings proved to be having considerable correspondence with actual results as published by Election Commission of Pakistan..},

To assess the overall organizational security awareness it therefore becomes interesting to assess both the users' individual level of security awareness, as well as their level of consistency and conformity with regard to other users' awareness.In the present case study, 15 semi-structured interviews have been undertaken within a large telecommunication company in order to understand how significant IT security aspects are understood within the organization. The study highlights a number of perception differences where the technical IT staff and the ordinary users do not share the same understanding. It is suggested that these perception differences result from a paradoxical situation where the users' possibility to uphold security awareness is hindered because of security concerns.},

abstract = {The sizes of hidden data sources are of great interests to public, researchers and even business competitors. Estimating the size of hidden data sources has been a challenging problem. Most existing methods are derived from the classic capture-recapture methods. Another approach is based on a large query pool. This method is not accurate due to the large variance of the document frequencies of queries in the query pool. Targeting this problem, we propose a new method to reduce the variance by constructing a query pool from a sample of the target data source so that document frequency variance is reduced, yet most of the documents can be covered. Our method is tested on a variety of large textual corpora, and outperforms the baseline random query method and the Broder et al's estimation method on all the datasets.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are known for its important role in diverse biological processes. One of the crucial issues to understand and classify PPI is to characterize their interfaces in order to discriminate between transient and permanent complexes. The stability of protein-protein interactions depends on the energetic features of interaction surfaces. This work explores the surfaces of complex interaction classified as permanent and transient, in order to find those energetic features that can differentiate between both type of complexes. We claim that the number of energetic features and their contribution to the interactions can be key factors to predict between transient and permanent interactions. Moreover, the features used can be adjusted according to the size of the complex studied. We evaluate different classifiers to predict these interactions, using a set of 298 complexes extracted from databases of protein complexes---in terms of their known three-dimensional structure---, and which were already classified as transient or permanent. As a result, we obtained an improved accuracy up to 86.6% when using SVM with kernel linear.},

While these families of networks present some general similarities, they also have some stark differences in the way the communities are formed. Namely, we find that the sizes of the best communities in such biological networks are an order of magnitude smaller than in social and other complex networks. We furthermore find that the generative model describing biological networks is very different from the model describing social networks. While for latter the Forest-Fire model best approximates their network community profile, for biological networks it is a random rewiring model that generates networks with the observed profiles. Our study suggests that these families of networks should be treated differently when deriving results from network analysis, and a fine-grained analysis is needed to better understand their structure.},

In the long history of development of traditional Chinese medicine, some herb prescriptions have been discovered to have effects in treating AD. Our study was to search the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Chinese medicine compound for treating AD and to summarize the rule of therapy for further studies. Methods: articles published in recent 10 years from CNKI and Pubmed databases were searched according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The qualities of included trials were assessed according to Jadad Scale. For the rule analysis, the relevant datas of herbs were extracted from the TCM prescription of each trial. Results: 26 RCTs were identified, of which only 4 trials were of high quality. 33 TCM prescriptions and totally 91 herbs were used in these 26 included RCTs. Tonic herbs were used more frequently than other kinds of Chinese medicinal materials. The herbs with effects of promoting blood circulation, resolving phlegm, clearing heat or tranquilization were also used frequently. Conclusions: Chinese medicinal materials with effects of tonic, promoting blood circulation, resolving phlegm, clearing heat or tranquilization might be potentially useful in treating AD for further researches. But it seems to be necessary to improve the quality of RCTs.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the advent of fast sequencing technology, the genomic database is growing rapidly. Researchers in the bioinformatics field are expecting faster and more accurate tools to effectively analyze the gigantic data sets. In the context of aptamer search, the goal is to search for the over-represented DNA sequences from the randomly generated aptamer libraries. Hash functions are widely used in substring comparison, sequence alignment and clustering tools. We have developed a light-weight tool that takes advantage of the hash functions to reduce the size of genomic data and conducts η-neighbor searches on the centroid sequence. This greatly improves the efficiency of the search compared with existing tools. Furthermore, the prior calculation of hash values of η-neighbors decreases the searching overhead. In a dataset of 2.23 million sequences, the proposed algorithm accurately count the frequency of the Human α-Thrombin aptamer sequences in less than 40 seconds, whereas the current script-based method takes 2 hours and 18 minutes.},

abstract = {Microblog has become a daily communication tool in recent years. Researches on microblog have drawn more and more attention. Microblogging emotional classification is a major research of user intent analysis based on User-Generated Content (UGC). This paper focuses on the discrimination on two emotional tendencies: positive and negative. Firstly, the system cleared the noisy elements in the microblog, then extracted the features of the microblog and finally classified the microblog using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, we improve the algorithms of feature extraction and weight computing combining dictionary approach and rule based approach. The result of experiment shows that the method is effective.},

abstract = {Single source refers to the unified measurement of different aspects of the same individual based on data from multiple sources. In the context of UGC, single source data can be used to study at least two important but as yet insufficiently investigated theoretical issues. First, single source data are ideal sources for studying inter-platform dynamics such as user migration across UGC platforms. Second, single source data can help to link individual self-reported cognitive factors with web crawled individual behavior logs, to achieve better understanding of individual behavior. In this paper, we select a random sample of Sina Blog users and collect their behavior information on both Sina Blog and Sina Weibo platforms; we also conduct an online survey to collect information about their cognitive factors. Merging all data together, we observe and quantify different behavior patterns of the same people across Blog and Weibo; we also identify alternative attractiveness and perceived popularity as significant drivers of one of the most important inter-platform dynamics---switching behavior.},

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relative features of graphs representing in real systems is community detection. The community detection can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph and a similar role play. It is an important problem in the analysis of computer networks, social networks, biological networks and many other natural and artificial networks. Thus, these networks are in general very large. And the finding hidden structures and functional modules are very hard tasks. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved. Many methods have been intended to deal with this problem in networks. Some of the most expectation are methods based on statistical inference, which support on solid mathematical foundations and return excellent results in practice. In this paper we show the blockmodeling, a collection of methods for partitioning networks according to well-specified criteria. We use the term "blockmodeling" to characterize the usual approach to blockmodeling, which based on the concepts of structural equivalence and regular equivalence. We also gives the idea about how community is detected in social networking by Euclidean distance algorithm and REGE algorithm.},

Furthermore, simulation and empirical study have been completed in two different platforms respectively to verify the accuracy of this model.

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Online social network services have embedded social rating systems that users can evaluate and share the quality of content such as the "Like" button for Facebook. This rating system is an important mechanism in social interaction since the system can affect the degree of user connection and the spread of information sharing. Most of such social rating systems, however, are based on the fixed feedback mechanism, where users cannot communicate their emotion and evaluation toward certain content in a real-time manner. In this research, we propose a novel feedback method that dynamically updates rating scores in social network services to give users immediate feedback. To confirm the usefulness of dynamic feedback mechanism compared to the current static feedback mechanism, we conducted an exploratory experiment with 46 participants in a simulated Facebook situation. Since types of content matter for the nature and degree of social interaction, we assumed that the dynamic feedback mechanism might yield different effects to different types of content. Hence, in the experiment, we included three different types of content, namely a) user-generated content, b) news article, and c) commercial advertisement, to examine the interaction effect between feedback mechanism and content types. The dependent variable was the number of "Like" clicks. The results indicate that the dynamic feedback type received significantly higher "Like" clicks than the fixed feedback type. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between feedback types and content types. The dynamic feedback mechanism was the most effective for the user-generated content type.},

Activity profiles can be useful for many purposes, such as marketing and user behavior analysis.

abstract = {Modularity is widely used to effectively measure the strength of the disjoint community structure found by community detection algorithms. Although several overlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of overlapping community structure, there is lack of systematic comparison of different extensions. To fill this gap, we overview overlapping extensions of modularity to select the best. In addition, we extend the Modularity Density metric to enable its usage for overlapping communities. The experimental results on four real networks using overlapping extensions of modularity, overlapping modularity density, and six other community quality metrics show that the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging coefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, our experiments indicate that overlapping modularity density is a better measure of the quality of overlapping community structure than other metrics considered.},

By extracting groups and analyzing their structure and relationship with one another, some interesting properties are shown, especially in the area of the groups' overlapping.

The topic of evaluating the importance of the nodes offers many different approaches that usually work with unweighted networks. We present a novel, simple and straightforward approach for the evaluation of the network's nodes with a focus on local properties in their surroundings. The presented approach is intended for weighted networks where the weight can be interpreted as the proximity between the nodes. Our suggested x-representativeness then takes into account the degree of the node, its nearest neighbors and one other parameter which we call the x-representativeness base. Following that, we also present experiments with three different real-world networks. The aim of these experiments is to show that the x-representativeness can be used to deterministically reduce the network to differently sized samples of representatives, while maintaining the topological properties of the original network.},

Visualization features by way of merging, linking, and grouping of entity attributes is provided to criminal network investigators. Furthermore, we believe that the prevailing challenges to information visualization can be eliminated to a large extent by detecting evolving network patterns, which are extracted by way of visual analysis of criminal activity based on temporal data. Finally, the proposed framework will indicate the most central person in the network in a unique way, which will support the investigators' decision making.},

abstract = {With the ease of carrying out an auction through internet, the electronic auction market is expanding rapidly. In online (i.e., continuous) eBay-like combinatorial auctions, bidders are allowed to join and leave the auction at any time, and in the process, bidders can repetitively bid on packages of items of their choice. In such multi-agent e-business systems, the seller is compelled to provide information feedback to the bidders after every bid on the current state of the auction to help them place more informed bids. This requires provisional winners be computed for every package of items after each bid by solving Winner Determination Problems. In multi-unit online combinatorial auctions where the number of bids can be significantly large, the paper presents for the first time dynamic programming approaches which can incrementally solve winner determination problems for every package after each new bid. We propose two dynamic programming algorithms to solve the multi-unit winner determination problem. While our first algorithm computes and stores the optimal values for all packages on arrival of a new bid traversing the packages in a reverse order, the alternative algorithm stores the optimal values only for packages that can fit into available memory but can find out the optimal solutions for every other package. We discuss the salient features of the algorithms, and demonstrate our approach through experiments. We also propose a bottom-up approach to dynamic programming for effective use of memory.},

Outcomes of previous tests can be taken into account for deciding which edge to test next.As a basic approach to this link discovery problem, we evaluate the performance of a number of scoring functions which have been proposed for predicting the future evolution of social networks. Furthermore, we develop a mechanism to apply supervised learning methods to the link discovery problem, where edge tests are utilized both for feature extraction and training sample generation. Our experiments with real and synthetic social networks demonstrate that, despite the sparsity of social network graphs, link discovery methods show a success rate improving upon random guessing by factors of up to 7.In addition, we also evaluate our link discovery methods in the context of an application where the nodes of the graph G represent moving objects and only links to nearby objects are beneficial to be discovered. Also here we achieve comparable success rates.},

As a result, persons are influenced by their friends and foes differently. Network applications can benefit from accompanying these structural differences in propagation schemes. In this paper, we study the optimal influence propagation policies for networks with positive and negative relationship types. We tackle the problem of minimizing the end-to-end propagation cost of influencing a target person in favor of an idea by utilizing the relationship types in the underlying social graph. The propagation cost is incurred by social and physical network dynamics such as frequency of interaction, the strength of friendship and foe ties, propagation delay or the impact factor of the propagating idea. We extend this problem by incorporating the impact of message deterioration and ignorance. We demonstrate our results in both a controlled environment and the Epinions dataset. Our results show that judicious propagation schemes lead to a significant reduction in the average cost and complexity of influence propagation compared to na\"{\i}ve myopic algorithms.},

Unlike previous studies on detecting rumors using tweets' inherent attributes generally, in this work, we shift the premise and focus on identifying event rumors on Weibo by extracting features from crowd responses that are texts of retweets (reposting tweets) and comments under a certain social event. Firstly the paper proposes a method of collecting theme data, including a sample set of tweets which have been confirmed to be false rumors based on information from the official rumor-busting service provided by Weibo. Secondly clustering analysis of tweets are made to examine the text features extracted from retweets and comments, and a classifier is trained based on observed feature distribution to automatically judge rumors from a mixed set of valid news and false information. The experiments show that the new features we propose are indeed effective in the classification, and especially some stop words and punctuations which are treated as noises in previous works can play an important role in rumor detection. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to detect rumors in Chinese via crowd responses under an emergency situation.},

abstract = {It has been shown in this paper that simplistic Bag of Words (BoW) lexicon methods for sentiment polarity assignment with ensemble classifiers are much faster than a supervised approach to sentiment classification while yielding similar accuracy. BoW methods also proved to be efficient and fast across all examined datasets. Moreover, a new approach to lexicon extraction that can be successfully used for sentiment polarity assignment is presented in the paper. It has been shown that accuracy obtained from such lexicons outperforms other lexicon based approaches.},

title = {Automatically Identifying Experts in On-Line Support Forums Using Social Interactions and Post Content},
year = {2014},
isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {On-line support forums are a common method for businesses to provide product support for customers. The utility of these forums are typically determined by a small number of expert users who provide a large percentage of the high quality answers. The automatic identification of these experts would enable businesses to more effectively manage their support forums, reduce costs, and provide better solutions to customer problems.In this paper we develop an unsupervised method for automatically identifying experts that uses multiple criteria to evaluate the helpfulness of author posts. The criteria for evaluating the helpfulness of a post are derived from two different sources: (1) the content of the post and (2) the social interaction between the post author and original user asking the question. The helpfulness scores are then used to identify expert users who consistently provide helpful posts to other user questions. The use of multiple criteria, in particular the social interaction criteria, make the expert identification more robust to spamming and data sparseness.We have demonstrated our expert identification method using data from the Cisco Support Community, an on-line question and answer forum for computer networking products and services. Preliminary results show that the method was able to identify top contributors to the forum category for network security products.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Location-based social networks provide services that allow users to share their locations with friends. To attract users and keep them active, social networks or venue holders may offer some awards. But some users make fake check-ins to achieve these awards. These cheaters cause monetary loss and decrease the accuracy of venue recommendations. In this paper, we study users of Foursquare, a popular location-based social network. Behaviors of cheaters and normal users are discussed. Two types of connections are defined to construct graphs of these users. And we propose a method to find cheaters using community structure of the constructed graphs. Our results verify that this cheater detection method is effective and costs little.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {As the microblogging service (such as Weibo) is becoming popular, spam becomes a serious problem of affecting the credibility and readability of Online Social Networks. Most existing studies took use of a set of features to identify spam, but without the consideration of the overlap and dependency among different features. In this study, we investigate the problem of spam detection by analyzing real spam dataset collections of Weibo and propose a novel hybrid model of spammer detection, called SDHM, which utilizing significant features, i.e. user behavior information, online social network attributes and text content characteristics, in an organic way. Experiments on real Weibo dataset demonstrate the power of the proposed hybrid model and the promising performance.},

isbn = {9781479958764},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The identification of influential spreaders of information via social networks can assist in the acceleration or hindrance of information dissemination, in increased product exposure, and in the detection of contagious disease outbreaks. Hub nodes, high betweenness nodes, high closeness nodes, and high k-shell nodes have been identified as good initial spreaders. However, researchers have overlooked node diversity within network structures as a means of measuring spreading ability. The two-step framework described in this paper uses a robust and insensitive measure that combines global diversity and local features (e.g., degree centrality) to identify the most influential social network nodes. Preliminary experiment results indicate that the proposed method performs well and maintains stability in single initial spreader scenarios associated with different social network datasets.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Community detection in inhomogeneous structured network is an attractive research problem that searches for methods to discover groups in which individuals are more densely interconnected with each other with higher probability of internal information propagation. While most of the previous approaches attempt to divide networks into communities according to the algorithm results of network or edge measurement, Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) adopts semi-supervised machine learning and implements community detection in an intelligent way with the automatic convergent process of network entity label iteration. In this work, we study the early community detection approaches, explore the low efficacy and stagnant converging rate of LPA in its response to network with overlapped communities, and propose a new approach for community detection using epidemic spreading virus to discover groups with super positioned members. Extensive experiments in synthetic signed network and real-life large networks derived from Internet social media are conducted to explore the optimal mechanism of the most suitable community-detecting virus infection.},

abstract = {Community question answering (CQA) sites provide us online platforms to post questions or answers. Generally, there are a great number of questions waiting to be answered by expert users. However, most of answerers are ordinary with just basic background knowledge in certain areas. To help askers to get their preferable answers, a set of possible expert users should be recommended. There have been some studies on the expert recommendation in CQA, the latest work models the user expertise under topics, where each topic is learnt based on the content and tags of questions and answers. Practically, such topics are too general, whereas question tags can be more informative and valuable than the topic of each question. In this paper, we study the user expertise under tags. Experimental analysis on a large data set from Stack Overflow demonstrates that our method performs better than the up-to-date method.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Nowadays, many tools and systems are available to allow the analysis and the comparison of researchers' scientific production. The reason underlying such interest is evident: promotions, funding allocations, and employments are currently based on the evaluation (and direct comparisons) of publication lists. Existing measures, like H-index, aim at supporting this process by automatic calculations of quality and/or quantity indices. In this work, we propose a demonstration of a web environment, available at http://d-index.di.unito.it, that faces the problem of studying the impact of collaborations in research communities. The presented system allows the estimation of the impact of each scientific collaboration on the production of each researchers indexed by the DBLP bibliographic database by means of a novel time-based modeling of collaborative environments. The proposed application provides several interactions and visualization schemes to deeply discover clear and latent insights, over time, around the work of each researcher. Furthermore, it allows cross-community rankings of the authors depending on similar collaboration patterns and dependences.},
