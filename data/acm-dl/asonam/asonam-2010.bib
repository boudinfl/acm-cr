abstract = {Data mining of network data often focuses on classification methods from machine learning, statistics, and pattern recognition perspectives. These techniques have been described by many, but many of these researchers are unaware of the rich history of classification and clustering techniques originating in social network analysis. The growth of rich social media, on-line communities, and collectively produced knowledge resources has greatly increased the need for good analytic techniques for social networks. We now have the opportunity to analyze social network data at unprecedented levels of scale and temporal resolution; this has led to a growing body of research at the intersection of the computing, statistics, and the social and behavioral sciences. This talk discusses some of the current challenges in the analysis of large-scale social network data, focusing on the inference of social processes from data. The invasion of network science by computer scientists has produced much interesting, both good and bad, research.},

abstract = {The world of information is seeing almost as much change today as it did back in the early 16th century when moveable type bookprinting was invented by Johannes Gutenberg. It took him some time to print his world famous 42 line bible, but just a few years later the technology had advanced so rapidly that Martin Luthers 95 theses could be disseminated in about 300.000 copies in two years! Early this year the rise of social networks has shown to be phenomenal. The number of queries in Facebook has for the first time surpassed the number of queries in Google. The number of Tweets reaches 50m per day. Although there is also news that indicates that Twitter is actually on the decline. Email is certainly on the decline, gradually being replaced by communication through social networks. Crime too, makes increased use of the Net and social networks. Microsoft claims 50bn spam messages per day. Ebay is increasingly being used for fraud. It is so much easier to steal 10 euro about 50 million times than to break in a bank or two for which you need the whole night. Banks in the NL are victims of fraud, many webshops considered to be a Walhalla of fraud. People are very careless with the Internet. On Twitter it is completely normal to inform the world you are NOT at home (www.pleaserobme.com). Remember the Dragon Hack? And the break in attempts at Google and other big US firms, a crime attributed to PR China? Facebook and the like are even used for murder. Social networks are a gold mine for terrorists and criminals alike. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center the use of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter by militant groups grew 20% in 2009. All that data (almost) is available in open sources such as weblogs, forums, newspapers, video, SMS messages, social network sites, journals, radio broadcast, etc. The by far majority of information is no longer available in text but in some other format. We have the analysts to interpret the information, to analyse it and produce actionable intelligence. What we do NOT have is scientists to create that information from the raw data. That is where you, conference delegates, come in. To produce the single, ultimate, all encompassing, universal 100% reliable algorithm to find the answers in network analyses. You have exactly three days to do it!},

This is what usually interests business users from marketing or PR. Modern search services offer a rich set of tools to monitor or track the blogosphere as a whole, but the analysis with respect to a certain domain is very limited. In this paper we lay some foundations to aggregate blog articles of a specific domain from multiple search services, to analyse the social authorities of articles and blogs, and to monitor the attention articles of the domain receive over time. These are the building blocks required for a monitoring application that presents users the currently most interesting articles. This methodology can be instantiated and combined with additional textual analysis methods to create highly automated business intelligence applications.},

We use our findings to analyze how defective entities integrated into different dynamic social networks.

That results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis on the map of computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network with the aims to understand its structure and to answer the above questions. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries for computer science (DBLP and CiteSeerX), the knowledge networks are created at venue (journals, conferences and workshops) level and social network analysis is applied to determine clusters of similar venues, interdisciplinary venues and high prestige venues.},

abstract = {Despites the great interest caused by social networks in Business Science, their analysis is rarely performed both in a global and systematic way in this field: most authors focus on parts of the studied network, or on a few nodes considered individually. This could be explained by the fact that practical extraction of social networks is a difficult and costly task, since the specific relational data it requires are often difficult to access and thereby expensive. One may ask if equivalent information could be extracted from less expensive individual data, i.e. data concerning single individuals instead of several ones. In this work, we try to tackle this problem through group detection. We gather both types of data from a population of students, and estimate groups separately using individual and relational data, leading to sets of clusters and communities, respectively. We found out there is no strong overlapping between them, meaning both types of data do not convey the same information in this specific context, and can therefore be considered as complementary. However, a link, even if weak, exists and appears when we identify the most discriminant attributes relatively to the communities. Implications in Business Science include community prediction using individual data.},

abstract = {Describing social positions and roles is an important topic within social network analysis. One approach is to compute a suitable equivalence relation on the nodes of the target network. One relation that is often used for this purpose is regular equivalence, or bisimulation, as it is known within the field of computer science. In this paper we consider a relation from computer science called simulation relation. Simulation creates a partial order on the set of actors in a network and we can use this order to identify actors that have characteristic properties. The simulation relation can also be used to compute simulation equivalence which is a less restrictive equivalence relation than regular equivalence but is still computable in polynomial time. This paper primarily considers weighted directed networks and we present definitions of both weighted simulation equivalence and weighted regular equivalence. Weighted networks can be used to model a number of network domains, including information flow, trust propagation, and communication channels. Many of these domains have applications within homeland security and in the military, where one wants to survey and elicit key roles within an organization. Identifying social positions can be difficult when the target organization lacks a formal structure or is partially hidden.},

abstract = {The vertex-betweenness centrality index is an essential measurement for analyzing social networks, but the computation time is excessive. At present, the fastest algorithm, proposed by Brandes in 2001, requires O(|V| |E|) time, which is computationally intractable for real-world social networks that usually contain millions of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate algorithm for estimating vertex-betweenness centrality values for social networks. It only requires O(b^2|V|) time, where b is the average degree in the network. Significantly, we demonstrate that the local dynamic information about the vertices is highly relevant to the global betweenness values. The experiment results show that the vertex-betweenness values estimated by the proposed model are close to the real values and their rank is fairly accurate. Furthermore, using data from online role-playing games, we present a new type of dynamic social network constructed from in-game chatting activity. Besides using such online game networks to evaluate our betweenness estimation model, we report several interesting findings derived from conducting static and dynamic social network analysis on game networks.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen an explosion in blogging and the blogosphere is continuing to grow, having a large global reach and many vibrant communities. Researchers have been pouring over blog data with the goal of finding communities, tracking what people are saying, finding influencers, and using many social network analytic tools to analyze the underlying social networks embedded within the blogosphere. One of the key technical problems with analyzing large social networks such as those embedded in the blogosphere is that there are many links between individuals and we often do not know the context or meaning of those links. This is problematic because it makes it difficult if not impossible to tease out the true communities, their behavior, how information flows, and who the central players are (if any). This paper seeks to further our understanding of how to analyze large blog networks and what they can tell us. We analyze 1.24M blogs posted by 298K bloggers over a period of three weeks. These bloggers span private blog sites through large blog-sites such as live journal and blogspot. We first characterize the behavior of bloggers, validating some (but not all) common beliefs about how often bloggers post, how long their posts are, who they link to and how much reciprocity there is in links. We then take a look at bloggers from the larger blog sites to understand whether and how they differ in terms of these metrics. Finally, we extend our analysis to focus on contextual links: what is the textual content of the blog which had a link. We identify topics from the textual content of all the blog posts and use these to tag links based on the topics that were discussed in the blog.},

abstract = {Incremental methods for detecting community structure are necessary when a graph's size or node-expansion cost makes global community-detection methods infeasible. Previous approaches to local community detection, which conflate edges between vertices in the immediate neighborhood of a partially-known community with edges to more distant vertices, often select vertices in an order that is suboptimal with respect to the actual community structure. This paper describes two new algorithms--MaxActivation and MaxDensity--whose vertex-selection policies focus on edges among the vertices in the partially-known community and its immediate neighborhood, ignoring edges to more distant vertices. In an empirical evaluation on a collection of natural and artificial graphs of varying degrees of community cohesion, the relative performance of alternative algorithms depended upon the degree distribution of each graph. These results demonstrate that the selection of an algorithm for incremental community detection should be guided by the characteristics of the graph to which it will be applied.},

We propose the IMMCA model - Iterative Multi-label Multi-Relational Classification Algorithm - a general algorithm for solving the inference and learning problems for this task. Inference is performed iteratively by propagating scores according to the multi-relational structure of the data. We detail two instances of this general model, implementing two different label propagation schemes on the multi-graph. This is the first collective classification method able to handle multiple relations and to perform multi-label classification in multi-graphs. The target application is image annotation in large social media sharing web sites (Flickr). The goal is to assign labels for images when users and images are connected through multiple relations - authorship, friendship, or visual/textual similarities. We show that our model is able to deal with both content and social relations and performs well on real datasets. Additional experiments on artificial data allow us analyzing the behavior of our method in different situations.},

Many algorithms have been proposed in recent years that are capable of assigning each node to more than a single community. The performance of these algorithms tends to degrade when the ground-truth contains a more highly overlapping community structure, with nodes assigned to more than two communities. Such highly overlapping structure is likely to exist in many social networks, such as Facebook friendship networks. In this paper we present a scalable algorithm, MOSES, based on a statistical model of community structure, which is capable of detecting highly overlapping community structure, especially when there is variance in the number of communities each node is in. In evaluation on synthetic data MOSES is found to be superior to existing algorithms, especially at high levels of overlap. We demonstrate MOSES on real social network data by analyzing the networks of friendship links between students of five US universities.},

In this paper, we concentrate on profiling as distinct from detection of phishing emails. We formulate the profiling problem as a multi-label classification problem using the hyperlinks in the phishing emails as features and structural properties of emails along with who is (i.e. DNS) information on hyperlinks as profile classes. Further, we generate profiles based on classifier predictions. Thus, classes become elements of profiles. We employ a boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) as well as SVMto generate multi-label class predictions on three different datasets created from hyperlink information in phishing emails. These predictions are further utilized to generate complete profiles of these emails. Results show that profiling can be done with quite high accuracy using hyperlink information.},

A large service provider handles, on daily basis, thousands of tickets that report various types of problems from its customers. The efficiency of this process highly depends on the effective interactions among various expert groups, in search of the resolver to the reported problem. In fact, ticket transfer decisions reflect the expertise awareness between groups, thus encoding a sophisticated resolution social network. In this paper, we propose a computational framework to quantitatively assess expertise awareness, i.e., how well a group knows the expertise of others. An accurate assessment of expertise awareness could identify the weakest components in a resolution system. The framework, built on our previously developed resolution engine, is able to calculate the performance difference caused by excluding a node from the network. The difference exposes the awareness of this node to other nodes in the network. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on this problem from a computational perspective. We tested the proposed framework on a large set of real-world problem tickets and validated our discovery by carefully analyzing the tickets that are incorrectly transferred. Experimental results show that our framework can successfully capture groups that do not know others' expertise very well.},

abstract = {In the Web 2.0 era, users share and discover interesting content via a network of relationships created in various social networking or content sharing sites. They can become for example contacts, followers or friends and express their appreciation of specific content uploaded by their peers by faving, retweeting or liking them depending on whether they are in Flickr, Twitter or Facebook respectively. Then they can discover additional content of interest through the lists of favorites of their contacts and so on. This faving (or favoring) functionality becomes thus a central part of content sharing communities for two purposes: (a) it helps the propagation of content amongst users and (b) it stimulates users' participation and activity. In this paper, we make a first step to understand users' faving behavior in content sharing communities in terms of reciprocity using publicly available datasets from Flickr and Twitter. Do users favor content only when they really appreciate it or they often feel the need to reciprocate when their content is appreciated by one of their contacts or even by a stranger? Do people take advantage of this process to gain popularity? What is the impact of the design, the social software, of a specific community and the type of content shared? These are some of the questions that our first results help to answer.},

abstract = {In identifying communities in the online environment most approaches consider as the basic tie that connects social actors together some form of direct contact, such as through communication. Other approaches use surrogates for direct ties including copresense, cooccurrence, or structural equivalence. In contrast, this paper focuses on semantic equivalence among social actors, regardless of their direct contact. In particular, to index semantic similarity, it measures the entire semantic network across the body of messages an individual produces and compares that network to another person’s to index how similar they are. Then it uses this similarity coefficient as the social network tie for network analysis to identify communities of semantic practice. Semantic similarity has some unique value for theory and practice in automated social network analysis. To illustrate this approach, this research extracted all 10, 001 posts from a public discussion forum authored by 3, 272 individuals and represented each author’s semantic network based on cooccurrences of all word pairs within three word positions. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for 5.36 million pairs of individuals using Quadratic Assignment Procedures (QAP). Authors sharing approximately 50% of their semantic networks numbered 22. Subsequent network analysis found that they constituted a single group in terms of a community of linguistic practice. A different forum was analyzed as a contrast. Applications of such a procedure can test hypotheses about semantic network similarity in relation to variations in communication frequency and modality More practical purposes would include finding persons of interest to add to a watch list.},

This paradigm has attracted the attention of researchers that wish to study the corresponding social and technological problems. Link recommendation is a critical task that not only helps increase the linkage inside the network and also improves the user experience. In an effective link recommendation algorithm it is essential to identify the factors that influence link creation. This paper enumerates several of these intuitive criteria and proposes an approach which satisfies these factors. This approach estimates link relevance by using random walk algorithm on an augmented social graph with both attribute and structure information. The global and local influences of the attributes are leveraged in the framework as well. Other than link recommendation, our framework can also rank the attributes in the network. Experiments on DBLP and IMDB data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for link recommendation.},

To accomplish this, centrality in a so-called feedback graph is often used as a trust measure. The nodes of this graph represent the individuals, and an edge represents feedback that evaluates a past interaction. In the open environments envisioned where individuals can specify for themselves of how to derive their trust in others, we observe that several centrality computations take place at the same time. With centrality computation being an expensive operation, performance is an important issue. While techniques for the optimization of a single centrality computation exist, little attention so far has gone into the computation of several centrality measures in combination. In this paper, we investigate how to compute several centrality measures at the same time efficiently. We propose two new optimization techniques and demonstrate their usefulness experimentally both on synthetic and on real-world data sets.},

However, approaches to detecting communities have largely focused on identifying communities in static graphs. Recently, researchers have begun to consider the problem of tracking the evolution of groups of users in dynamic scenarios. Here we describe a model for tracking the progress of communities over time in a dynamic network, where each community is characterised by a series of significant evolutionary events. This model is used to motivate a community-matching strategy for efficiently identifying and tracking dynamic communities. Evaluations on synthetic graphs containing embedded events demonstrate that this strategy can successfully track communities over time in volatile networks. In addition, we describe experiments exploring the dynamic communities detected in a real mobile operator network containing millions of users.},

It is similar to many recent graph-based SSL methods and is shown to be essentially the same as the Gaussian-field harmonic functions classifier proposed by Zhu et al. (2003) and proves to be very effective on some benchmark network datasets. We describe another simple and intuitive semi-supervised learning method based on random graph walk that outperforms wvRN by a large margin on several benchmark datasets when very few labels are available. Additionally, we show that using authoritative instances as training seeds --- instances that arguably cost much less to label --- dramatically reduces the amount of labeled data required to achieve the same classification accuracy. For some existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods the labeled data needed is reduced by a factor of 50.},

abstract = {Many relationships naturally come in a bipartite setting: authors that write articles, proteins that interact with genes, or customers that buy, rent or rate products. Often we are interested in the clustering behavior of one side of the graph, i.e., in finding groups of similar articles or products. To find these clusters, a one-mode projection is classically applied, which results in a normal graph that can then be clustered by various methods. For data with strongly skewed degree distributions, a classical one-mode projection leads to very dense graphs with little information. In this article we propose a new method for a meaningful one-mode projection of any kind of bipartite graph $B$ to a sparse general graph $G$, using a modified version of the so-called {it leverage}. We provide ample experimental evidence that the method creates edges in $G$ only between statistically significant neighbors and that the results are reliable and stable. For this, we present an output sensitive algorithm to compute Kendall's $tau$. Moreover, for a subset of films in the Netflix prize data set, we can prove that the proposed method not only detects the statistically significantly co-rented films in the data set but that these are also the films that are the most similar ones by content. Thus, our method cannot only be used for the one-mode projection of bipartite graphs in general but also especially for any kind of market basket data to find pairs of most similar products as needed for, e.g., recommendation systems.},

abstract = {To understand the diffusive spreading of a product in a telecom network, whether the product is a service, handset, or subscription, it can be very useful to study the structure of the underlying social network. By combining mobile traffic data and product adoption history from one of Telenor’s markets, we can define and measure an adoption network—roughly, the social network of adopters. By studying the time evolution of adoption networks, we can observe how different products diffuses through the network, and measure potential social influence. This paper presents an empirical and comparative study of three adoption networks evolving over time in a large telecom network. We believe that the strongest spreading of adoption takes place in the dense core of the underlying network, and gives rise to a dominant largest connected component (LCC) in the adoption network, which we call “the social network monster”. We believe that the size of the monster is a good indicator for whether or not a product is taking off. We show that the evolution of the LCC, and the size distribution of the other components, vary strongly with different products. The products studied in this article illustrate three distinct cases: that the social network monsters can grow or break down over time, or fail to occur at all. Some of the reasons a product takes off are intrinsic to the product; there are also aspects of the broader social context that can play in. Tentative explanations are offered for these phenomena. Also, we present two statistical tests which give an indication of the strength of the spreading over the social network. We find evidence that the spreading is dependent on the underlying social network, in particular for the early adopters.},

abstract = {Mobile Social Network Analysis is the mapping and measuring of interactions and flows between people, groups, and organizations based on the usage of their mobile communication services. Social Network Analysis and Mining has been highly influenced by the online social web sites, telecom consumer data and instant messaging systems, and has widely analyzed the presence of dense communities using graph theory and machine learning techniques. Community mining is one of the recent major directions in social network analysis. In this paper we find the communities in the network based on a modularity factor. Then we propose a graph theory based algorithm for further split of communities resulting in smaller sized and closely knit sub-units, to understand consumer behavior in a comprehensive manner. These sub-units are then analyzed and labeled based on their group behavior pattern. In this paper we measure and analyze the uniqueness of the structural properties for each small unit, it is another quick way to assign suitable labels for each distinct group. The effectiveness of the employed algorithms was evaluated on a huge telecom database in three different stages of our work.},

abstract = {A terrorist network is a special kind of social network with emphasis on both secrecy and efficiency. Such networks are intentionally structured to ensure efficient communication between members without being detected. A terrorist network can be modeled as a generalized network (graph) consisting of nodes and links. Techniques from social network analysis and graph theory can be used to identify key entities in the network, which is helpful for network destabilization purposes. Research on terrorist network analysis has mainly focuses on analysis of nodes, which is in contrast to the fact that the links between the nodes provide at least as much relevant information about the network as the nodes themselves. This paper presents a novel method to analyze the importance of links in terrorist networks inspired by research on transportation networks. The link importance measure is implemented in CrimeFighter Assistant and evaluated on known terrorist networks.},

abstract = {Given a dataset comprising a temporal sequence of communications between actors, how can we visualize the ‘flow’ of communication over time? Current practice transforms the dataset into a dynamic graph – vertices represent the actors and directed edges represent the communications. The directed edges are added and removed over time. There are then several approaches to visualizing dynamic graphs that optimize aesthetic criteria, most producing animated node-link diagrams. However, dynamic graphs are not the only way to model this problem. One alternative from the field of distributed computing is vector clocks. Recent work employed vector clocks to analyze communication flow in social networks with much effect, arguing that they provide new insights into the problem. In this paper, we use vector clocks as a basis for visualizing communication flow. We show that communication patterns, e.g., random, partitioned and core-periphery, are easily discernible in the resulting visualizations. We also argue that, in the cases where vector clocks are used to analyze communication flow, it is most natural to base the accompanying visualizations on vector clocks also.},

abstract = {Subgraph matching is a key operation on graph data. Social network (SN) providers may want to find all subgraphs within their social network that match certain query graph patterns. Unfortunately, subgraph matching is NP-complete, making its application to massive SNs a major challenge. Past work has shown how to implement subgraph matching on a single processor when the graph has 10-25M edges. In this paper, we show how to use cloud computing in conjunction with such existing single processor methods to efficiently match complex subgraphs on graphs as large as 778M edges. A cloud consists of one master compute node and k slave compute nodes. We first develop a probabilistic method to estimate probabilities that a vertex will be retrieved by a random query and that a pair of vertices will be successively retrieved by a random query. We use these probability estimates to define edge weights in an SN and to compute minimal edge cuts to partition the graph amongst k slave nodes. We develop algorithms for both master and slave nodes that try to minimize communication overhead. The resulting COSI system can answer complex queries over real-world SN data containing over 778M edges very efficiently.},

abstract = {The discovery of evolving communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that poses challenging tasks. Previous evolutionary based clustering methods try to maximize cluster accuracy, with respect to incoming data of the current time step, and minimize clustering drift from one time step to the successive one. In order to optimize both these two competing objectives, an input parameter that controls the preference degree of a user towards either the snapshot quality or the temporal quality is needed. In this paper the detection of communities with temporal smoothness is formulated as a multiobjective problem and a method based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it automatically provides a solution representing the best trade-off between the accuracy of the clustering obtained, and the deviation from one time step to the successive. Experiments on synthetic data sets show the very good performance of the method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Now a days, more and more of social network data are being published in one way or other. So, preserving privacy in publishing social network data has become an important concern. With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims easily. Most of the work done so far towards privacy preservation can deal with relational data only. However, Bin Zhou and Jian Pei [11] proposed a scheme for anonymization of social networks, which is an initiative in this direction and provides a partial solution to this problem. In fact, their algorithm cannot handle the situations in which an adversary has knowledge about vertices in the second or higher hops of a vertex, in addition to its immediate neighbors. In this paper, we propose a modification to their algorithm for the network anonymization which can handle such situations. In doing so, we use an algorithm for graph isomorphism based on adjacency matrix instead of their approach using DFS technique [11]. More importantly, the time complexity of our algorithm is less than that of Zhou and Pei.},

We note that in many applications, the key interest is on the high-betweenness vertices and that their betweenness rankings are usually adequate for analysts to work with. Hence, we have developed a novel algorithm that efficiently returns the set of vertices with highest betweenness. The algorithm‘s convergence criterion is based on the membership stability of the high-betweenness set. Through experiments on various artificial and real world networks, the algorithm is shown to be both efficient and accurate.},

abstract = {Community detection consists in searching cohesive subgroups in complex networks. It has recently become one of the domain pivotal questions for scientists in many different fields where networks are used as modeling tools. Algorithms performing community detection are usually tested on real, but also on artificial networks, the former being costly and difficult to obtain. In this context, being able to generate networks with realistic properties is crucial for the reliability of the tests. Recently, Lancichinetti et al. [1] designed a method to produce realistic networks, with a community structure and power law distributed degrees and community sizes. However, other realistic properties such as degree correlation and transitivity are missing. In this work, we propose a modification of their approach, based on the preferential attachment model, in order to remedy this limitation. We analyze the properties of the generated networks and compare them to the original approach. We then apply different community detection algorithms and observe significant changes in their performances when compared to results on networks generated with the original approach.},

While knowing these user behaviors can help to create more intelligent email services, there has not been much research into mining these behaviors. In this paper, we investigate user engagingness and responsiveness as two interaction behaviors that give us useful insights into how users email one another. Engaging users are those who can effectively solicit responses from other users. Responsive users are those who are willing to respond to other users. By modeling such behaviors, we are able to mine them and to identify engaging or responsive users. This paper proposes four types of models to quantify engagingness and responsiveness of users. These behaviors can be used as features in the email reply order prediction task which predicts the email reply order given an email pair. Our experiments show that engagingness and responsiveness behavior features are more useful than other non-behavior features in building a classifier for the email reply order prediction task. When combining behavior and non-behavior features, our classifier is also shown to predict the email reply order with good accuracy.},

Two variations of the link prediction tasks are studied: predicting links in a bipartite graph and predicting links in a unimodal graph obtained by the projection of a bipartite graph over one of its node sets. For both tasks, we show in an empirical way, that taking into account the bipartite nature of the graph can enhance substantially the performances of prediction models we learn. This is achieved by introducing new variations of topological atttributes to measure the likelihood of two nodes to be connected. Our approach, for both tasks, consists in expressing the link prediction problem as a two class discrimination problem. Classical supervised machine learning approaches can then be applied in order to learn prediction models. Experimental validation of the proposed approach is carried out on two real data sets: a co-authoring network extracted from the DBLP bibliographical database and bipartite graph history of transactions on an on-line music e-commerce site.},

abstract = {The most important feature of Internet forums is their social aspect. Many forums are active for a long period of time and attract a group of dedicated users, who build a tight social community around a forum. With great abundance of forums devoted to every possible aspect of human activity, such as politics, religion, sports, technology, entertainment, economy, fashion, and many more, users are able to find a forum that perfectly suits their needs and interests. In this paper we introduce a micro-community-based model for descriptive characterization of Internet forums. We show how a simple concept of a micro-community can be used to quantitatively assess the openness and durability of an Internet forum. We also show that our model is capable of producing a taxonomy of Internet forums using unsupervised clustering method. We present the micro-community model, the set of basic statistics, and we apply the model to several real-world online forums to experimentally verify the correctness and robustness of the model.},

abstract = {Nowadays, users of online platforms can manage their own visibility and therefore popularity by mixing self-publishing activities and social networking. If one can develop strategies for building a reputation, his success is not determined only by his actions but also by the context in which he is involved. His popularity may evolve during time and this can be caused by multiple reasons. In this study we try to understand the reasons behind the evolution of MySpace artists' popularity. We use an additive mixture model in order to explain the variation of popularity between two snapshots of the same MySpace population. First we categorize the population into 5 clusters depending on their audience and authority in the first snapshot. Then we compute a model to assess the factors explaining the variation of popularity. We find that the evolution of the popularity, both in terms of audience and authority, is not explained by the same factors depending on the initial popularity.},

abstract = {Searching for the right information over the Web is not straight-forward. In the era of high speed internet, high capacity networks, and interactive Web applications, it has become even easier for the users to publish data online. A huge amount of data is published over the internet; every data is in the form of web pages, news, blogs and other material, etc. Similarly, for search engines like Google and Yahoo, it becomes rather hard to find out the right information, i.e., as per user’s preferences; search results for same query differ in priority for different users. In this paper, we proposed a way to prioritize search results of search engines like Google, based on the personal interests and context of users. In order to find out personal interest and context, we follow a unique approach of (1) finding out activities of a user of his/her social-network, (2) finding out what information does the social networks (i.e., friends and community) provide to the user. Based on this information, we have developed a methodology that takes into account the information about social networks and prioritize search results from Web search engine.},

The communication structure among the players is modeled by use of the so-called connectivity game. We analyze standard networks representative of covert organizations and present results on the centrality of players organized according to an a-symmetric path structure. In addition we present an analysis of a weighted connectivity game in which the worth of coalitions not only depends on their interaction structure but also on exogenous factors.},

Cached profiles are then mined in a two-step approach, using a clusterer and a classifier to generate predictive model presenting weighted profiles, which are used later on by a semantic recommender to suggest and recommend the community members with the items of their similar interest.},

In this paper, we apply network analysis methods to the linguistic domain for classifying subjective documents. Particularly, we view that subjective documents are related to one another according to some common subjective words and build a subjective document network of which nodes are documents and of which links represent the similarity between two documents. In addition, we consider that adjectives and adverbs are the two representatives carrying sentimental polarities among parts-of-speeches, and perform experiments for three cases, using adjectives only, adverbs only, and both adjectives and adverbs together. In conclusion, this paper proposes a new method to the subjective document classification problem by applying network analysis methods without requiring linguistic domain knowledge and suggests the possibility of detecting themes among documents rather than binary classification.},

The number and diversity of interactions that take place over time between users and applications within these platforms make these environments very good candidates for learning various types of information about users’ interests. We are particularly interested in the determination of users’ short-term and long-term interests which are essential for adaptative systems that take into account the evolution of user’s needs. While studies in adaptative systems focus on computing interests’ weight value and time periods to determine user’s short-term and long-term profile, we focus instead on temporal graphs’ visualization of users’ interests. From a case study on Facebook, we use dynamic graphs in order to view the influence of social ties on the user’s interests.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis describes the division of a dataset into subsets of related objects, which are usually disjoint. There is considerable variety among the different types of clustering algorithms. Some of these clustering algorithms represent the dataset as a graph, and use graph-based properties to generate the clusters. However, many graph properties have not been explored as the basis for a clustering algorithm. In graph theory, a subgraph of a graph is distance-preserving if the distances (lengths of shortest paths) between every pair of vertices in the subgraph are the same as the corresponding distances in the original graph. In this paper, we consider the question of finding proper distance-preserving subgraphs, and the problem of partitioning a simple graph into an arbitrary number of distance-preserving subgraphs for clustering purposes. We also present a clustering algorithm called DP-Cluster, based on the notion of distance-preserving subgraphs. One area of research that makes considerable use of graph theory is the analysis of social networks. For this reason we evaluate the performance of DP-Cluster on two real-world social network datasets.},

Especially we carry out dimension reduction regarding web pages' similarity. This approach uses generalized eigenvectors and is different from usual eigenvalue problems. Using artificially generated data, we explain that the feature space constructed with our proposed method emphasizes the essential relationship between web pages. And using real social bookmarking data, we describe our proposed method can make good clusters.},

Recently organizations started deploying internal Enterprise 2.0 platforms and Social Network Sites (SNS) to improve how employees collaborate and work. In this paper we report our analysis of the relationships between social capital and the use of a SNS in a research institute. Data collected through a survey from 54% of its 670 employees have been investigated with factor and regression analysis. We found users enabled to use the system, currently one third of all employees, have significantly higher social capital. Moreover social capital correlates with self-reported intensity of SNS usage, while we did not find statistically significant correlation with real usage extracted from system logs but for the unexpected fact that heavy users exhibit a smaller knowledge of their colleagues. We also find significant relationships between social capital and different demographic features such as seniority, job role, age, gender. There are few studies analyzing the real impact of SNSs on employees ability to collaborate. We believe further work is needed in this area so we released the SNS we developed as open source software, aiming at promoting its adoption by other organizations. We also released the dataset we collected in this analysis for comparative purposes.},

abstract = {The 2009 presidential elections forever changed the face of politics in Iran. What were at first protests against the election’s results led to become demonstrations defying many fundamentals on which the Islamic Republic system of Iran is based. This movement, which is called the green movement, uses online communities like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for news coverage and organization. Studying these communities in order to understand the structure and organization of the green movement is crucial because it provides an insight into anthropological and sociological characteristics of modern social movements. Social network analysis is a perfect tool for studying these concepts. In this paper, the prominent features of the social network related to the Green Movement are derived and analyzed.},

abstract = {The motivation for the study described in this paper is realizing the fact that organizational structure of a group is a key indicator in determining its strengths and weaknesses. A general knowledge of the prevalent models of terrorist organizations leads to a better understanding of their capabilities. Knowledge of the different labels and systems of classification that have been applied to groups and individuals aid us in discarding useless or irrelevant terms, and in understanding the purposes and usefulness of different terminologies. Previous studies in network analysis have mostly dealt with legal networks with transparent structures. Terrorist networks share some features with conventional (real world) networks, but they are harder to identify because they mostly hide their illicit activities. In this paper we describe a novel approach for extracting structural patterns of terrorist networks with the help of social network analysis measures and techniques. We propose a global measure for estimating the degree of organization of social networks; the measure is global in terms of being applied to the whole network as an entity and being extracted from the major well-known SNA measures. The importance of such research comes from the fact that individuals in organized intellectual networks and especially terrorist networks tend to hide their individual rules and thus there is a need to deal with such networks as a whole, discovering the degree of organization and thus its strengths and weaknesses.},

We empirically examined how the nature of project designs and social pressure affect contribution to the open source platform. In the twenty-one projects (3, 998 contributions) from 2004 to 2009, we find that the average number of contributions is higher when the projects are highly visible, when the project is designed to require specific skills from participants, and when it requires outcome measurement from participants’ proposals. Also, we verified that actors join collective action when they believe their contribution is meaningful and they would stop when they believe their contribution could be marginal. These results provide implications for open source platform design in the philanthropic sector.},

abstract = {The world has fundamentally changed as the Internet has become a universal means of communication. The Web is a huge virtual space where to express individual opinions and influence any aspect of life. Internet contains a wealth of data that can be mined to detect valuable opinions, with implications even in the political arena. Nowadays the Web sources are more accessible and valuable than ever before, but most of the times the true valuable information is hidden in thousands of textual pages. Their transformation into information is therefore strongly linked to their automatic lexical analysis and semantic synthesis. This poster describes a Knowledge Mining study performed on over 1000 news articles or posts in forum/blogs, concerning the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, involved last year in the sexual scandal. All these textual contributions have been Morpho-Syntactically analysed, Semantically Role labelled and Clustered in order to find meaningful similarities, hilite possible hidden relationships and evaluate their sentiment polarity.},

Analyzing covert networks after an incident is practically easy for trial purposes. Mapping clandestine networks to thwarted terrorist activities is much more complicated. The network surrounding the recent Denmark terror plan is studied through publicly available information. We are able to map a piece of the network centered on David Headley, who recently confessed to have planned a terrorist attack to take place on Danish soil. The map gives us an insight into the organizations and people involved.},

abstract = {Social tags are annotations for Web pages collaboratively added by users. It will be much easier to understand the meaning of Web pages and classify them according to their tags. The precision in retrieving Web pages may also increase using such tags. Nowadays social tags are mostly annotated manually by users via social bookmarking Web sites. Such manual annotation process may produce diverse, redundant, and inconsistent tags. Besides, many tags which are inconsistent with their annotated Web pages exist and deteriorate the feasibility of social tags. In this work we will develop an automatic scheme to discover the associations between Web pages and social tags and apply such associations on applications of social tag spam detection. We applied a text mining approach based on self-organizing maps to find the relationships between Web pages and social tags. The disadvantages of manual annotation will be remedied through such relationships. The discovered associations were then used to identify social tag spams. Preliminary experiments show that the quality and usability of social tags were improved through this method.},

abstract = {Recently, a huge wave of social media has generated significant impact in people's perceptions about technological domains. They are captured in several blogs/forums, where the themes relate to products of several companies. One of the companies can be interested to track them as resources for customer perceptions and detect user sentiments. The keyword-based approaches for identifying such themes fail to give satisfactory level of accuracy. Here, we address the above problems using statistical text-mining of blog entries. The crux of the analysis lies in mining quantitative information for textual entries. Once the relevant blog entries for the company/ its competitors are filtered out, the theme identification is performed using a highly accurate novel technique termed as 'Best Separators Algorithm'. Logistic regression coupled with dimension reduction technique (singular value decomposition) is used to identify the tonality of those blogs. The final analysis shows significant improvement in terms of accuracy over popular approaches.},

abstract = {Extremist political movements have proliferated on the web in recent years due to the advent of minimal publication costs coupled with near universal access, resulting in what appears to be an abundance of groups that hover on the fringe of many socially divisive issues. Whether white-supremacist, neo- Nazi, anti-abortion, black separatist, radical Christian, animal rights, or violent environmentalists, all have found a home (and voice) on the Web. These groups form social networks whose ties are predicated primarily on shared political goals. Little is known about these groups, their interconnections, their animosities, and most importantly, their growth and development and studies such as the Dark Web Project, while considering domestic extremists, have focused primarily on international terrorist groups. Yet here in the US, there has been a complex social dynamic unfolding as well. While left-wing radicalism declined throughout the 80s and 90s, right wing hate groups began to flourish. Today, the web offers a place for any brand of extremism, but little is understood about their current growth and development. While there is much to gain from in-depth studies of the content provided by these sites, there is also a surprising amount of information contained in their online network structure as manifested in links between and among these web sites. Our research follows the idea that much can be known about you by the company you keep. In this paper, we propose an approach to measure the intrinsic relationships (i.e., similarities) of a set of extremist web pages. In this model, the web presence of a group is thought of as a node in a social network and the links between these pages are the ties between groups. This approach takes the bi-directional hyperlink structure of web pages and, based on similarity scores, applies an effective multi-membership clustering algorithm known as the quasi clique merger method to cluster these web pages using a derived hierarchical tree. The experimental results show that this new similarity measurement and hierarchical clustering algorithm gives an improvement over traditional link based clustering methods.},
