abstract = {In a "tipping" model, each node in a social network, representing an individual, adopts a behavior if a certain number of his incoming neighbors previously held that property. A key problem for viral marketers is to determine an initial "seed" set in a network such that if given a property then the entire network adopts the behavior. Here we introduce a method for quickly finding seed sets that scales to very large networks. Our approach finds a set of nodes that guarantees spreading to the entire network under the tipping model. After experimentally evaluating 31 real-world networks, we found that our approach often finds such sets that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the population size. Our approach also scales well - on a Friendster social network consisting of 5.6 million nodes and 28 million edges we found a seed sets in under 3.6 hours. We also find that highly clustered local neighborhoods and dense network-wide community structure together suppress the ability of a trend to spread under the tipping model.},

abstract = {The recent interest in network analysis is caused by the unprecedented accessibility to large datasets: there are huge, publicly available databases on protein-protein-interactions, air transportation, and street maps which easily lend themselves to a network representation. Once a network is created, all types of path-based network analytic measures can be easily applied: typical examples are centrality measures, but also some clustering algorithms and robustness analysis rely on path-based measures. Borgatti has claimed that centrality measures basically simulate dissemination processes of goods which use a certain subset of paths on the given network [1]; they can thus only be used to describe processes which rely on the same type of good and the same subset of paths. Later, Butts pointed out that the results of a chosen network analytic method strongly vary with modeling decisions taken when turning raw data into networks [2]. In this article we combine these two insights to the trilemma of network analysis which states that the network process of interest, the network representation, and the network analytic method cannot be chosen independently. We discuss on two real-world examples in the realm of air transportation networks how to choose a distance based measure with respect to the context of the data, re-computing similar analyses by Guimer'a et al. [3] and Dall'Asta et al. [4]. In both cases, the path-based measures matching the network process of interest change the interpretation of the previous findings, which shows the potential in regarding the trilemma of network analysis.},

Bibliographic data on local publications in Turkey is used. It consists of 7835 papers written by 6738 scientists. Findings suggest that (1) there are gender differences at publication productivity, participation, presence and contribution, that (2) there are significantly different tendencies at keeping established co-authorship ties for inter-gender and intra-gender pairs, that (3) there are significant gender differences at positions of individuals in the network structure. It is seen that while female scientists are seen to be embedded in cliques more often than males, males are more active at bridging different components in the network. This study exemplifies an integrated approach to better examine role of gender in scientific collaborations.},

The enhancement technique we propose is based on lexico-semantic expansion of tweet contents while applying document similarity and clustering algorithms. Considering the length limitations and idiosyncratic spelling in Twitter environment, it is possible to take advantage of word similarities and to enrich texts with similar words. The semantic expansion technique we implement is based on syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships between words, extracted from their co-occurrence statistics. As our technique does not depend on an existing ontology or a lexicon database such as Word Net, it should be applicable for any language. The proposed technique is applied on a tweet set collected for three days from the users in Turkey. The results indicate earlier detection of events and improvements in accuracy.},

With an analogy to the traditional task of mining frequent item sets, we show that the issue addressed can be formulated in terms of a conceptual analysis that elicits conceptual links. A social-based conceptual link is a synthetic representation of a set of links between groups of vertexes that share similar internal properties. We propose a first algorithm that optimizes the search into the concept lattice of conceptual links and extracts maximal frequent conceptual links. We study the performances of our solution and give experimental results obtained on a sample example. Finally we show that the set of conceptual links extracted provides a conceptual view of the social network.},

year = {2012},
isbn = {9780769547992},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Among many real world applications of social network analysis, political interaction and executive succession show some unique characteristics of dynamic community evolution and raise interesting research challenges. Interactions of political power among community members are mostly subtle and behind the scene. Visible relations are only nominal and are not readily apparent to key findings. Under such difficult circumstances of information deficiency, the research problem is to uncover the inner relations among some of the network entities and to discover the hidden network structure based on these inner relations. In this research, our objective is to identify the inner circles of government political power and bureaucracy underneath formal work relations and observe how the political elite groups form and change over time. A government official job change network in a time span of over twenty years is built to model synchronous post assignment and job promotion within a time window as entity relations. In each snapshot of network evolution, communities that exhibit strong association of synchronous job change are identified by the edge betweenness decomposition algorithm. Then, an event-based framework is used to characterize community behavior patterns in consecutive changes of network structures. The approach is effectually demonstrated on two scenarios: (1) identifying and tracking the inner circle of a leading political figure, (2) finding succession pool members in government agencies. We further propose two evolutionary community variation indexes to assess political executive succession. Experimental results with actual government personnel data provide evidence that government agency succession can be reasonably measured. This work also has the practical value of providing objective scrutiny on political power transition for the benefit of public interest.},

The measure is based on the changing size of the largest component as the network goes through disintegration. We argue that the measure can be used to quantify and compare the effectiveness of various attack strategies. Applying this measure, we confirm the result that scale-free networks are comparatively less vulnerable to random attacks and more vulnerable to targeted attacks. Then we analyse the robustness of a range of real world networks, and show that most real world networks are least robust to attacks based on betweenness of nodes. We also show that the robustness of some networks are more sensitive to the attack strategy compared to others, and given the disparity in the computational complexities of calculating various centrality measures, the robustness coefficient introduced can play a key role in choosing the attack and defence strategies for real world networks. While the measure is applicable to all types of complex networks, we clearly demonstrate its relevance to social network analysis.},

Specifically, we train a prediction model to forecast whether a tweet will be retweeted by a given user, leveraging four different types of features: social-based, content-based, tweet-based and author-based features. By performing """"leave-one-feature-out"""" comparisons, we identify factors that are strongly associated with user retweet behavior.},

A sustainable community development seeks to balance its environmental, economical, social and cultural needs. In recent years, governments and NGOs in Taiwan invest huge amounts of resources in post-disaster community reconstruction. Their focuses are mainly on environmental and economical fronts. What has often been overlooked is the preservation of the way of life in the original habitat. By applying SNA measures, this study extracts the characteristics of the spatial organization that facilitate the fabrics of everyday life in a human settlement and proposes how this information can contribute to social and cultural preservation in Taiwan's post-disaster reconstruction in the future.},

abstract = {Making investment decision on various available stocks in the market is a challenging task. Econometric and statistical models, as well as machine learning and data mining techniques, have proposed heuristic based solutions with limited long-range success. In practice, the capabilities and intelligence of financial experts is required to build a managed portfolio of stocks. However, for non-professional investors, it is too complicated to make subjective judgments on available stocks and thus they might be interested to follow an expert's investment decision. For this purpose, it is critical to find an expert with similar investment preferences. In this work, we propose to benefit from the power of Social Network Analysis in this domain. We first build a social network of financial experts based on their publicly available portfolios. This social network is then used for further analysis to recommend an appropriate managed portfolio to non-professional investors based on their behavioral similarities to the expert investors. This approach is evaluated through a case study on real portfolios. The result shows that the proposed portfolio recommendation approach works well in terms of Sharpe ratio as the portfolio performance metric.},

abstract = {Most real-world social network analysis treats edges (relationships) as having different intensities (weights), but the same qualitative properties. We address the problem of modelling edges of qualitatively different types that nevertheless interact with one another. For example, influence flows along friend and colleagues edges differently, but treating the two sets of different kinds of edges as independent graphs surely misses interesting and useful structure. We model the sub graph corresponding to each edge type as a layer, and show how to weight the edges connecting the layers to produce a consistent spectral embedding, including for directed graphs. This embedding can be used to compute social network properties of the combined graph, to predict edges, and to predict edge types. We illustrate with Padgett's dataset of Florentine families in the 15th Century.},

abstract = {Email communication patterns have been long used to derive the underlying social network structure. By looking at who is talking to who and how often, the researchers have disclosed interesting patterns, hinting on social roles and importance of actors in such networks. Email communication analysis has been previously applied to discovering cliques and fraudulent activities (e.g. the Enron email network), to observe information dissemination patterns, and to identify key players in email communication networks. In this paper we are using a large dataset of email communication within a constrained community (i.e. the employees of a single institution) to discover the importance of employees in the underlying network. Contrary to previous attempts, though, we are scrutinizing the delays in answering emails. We base our method on a simple notion of implicit importance: people are more likely to quickly respond to emails sent by people who are being perceived as important. In the paper we propose several methods for building the social network from the email communication data and we introduce various weighting schemes. We aggregate the resulting rankings and compute differences between rankings to observe the stability of our method. We also compare the resulting rankings with an a priori assessment of employees' importance to verify our method. The results of the conducted experiments clearly show the validity and robustness of the proposed method.},

The results indicate that interactive predictability of effective sizes and significant ties to knowledge competitions can reveal the effects on competitive advantages. Based on this predictability, a person's knowledge-contribution to a network of ICT-integration instruction is classified as ineffective with less positional and informational benefits. These findings help confront the deficiency of the achievements of ICT integration instructions and encourage reconsidering the role of STCs in ICT-in-education practices.},

publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Although successfully employed to reduce error rates of difficult pattern recognition problems, multi-classifier systems (MCS) are not in widespread use in the field of Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining. The motivation of using a MCS stems from the fact that different classifiers usually make different errors on different samples. By using just the best classifier, it is possible to loose valuable information contained in the other sub optimal classifiers. In this work, we take advantage of unigrams, big rams and trig rams to design a multi-classifier system for Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining. Three different Naive Bayes classifiers are trained--each one with a specific set of features-- , and then combined in the ROC space by using the Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) technique. IBC iteratively combines the ROC curves produced by different classifiers using all Boolean functions, and does not require prior assumption that the classifiers are statistically independent. An experimental study investigates the advantage of using the proposed MCS, over each individual classifier, in classifying Twitter messages as positive or negative. The Stanford University's Twitter database is employed for this task. As real-world application, the proposed MCS is used to identify the sentiment of electors regarding the main candidates for the 2012 United States Presidential Elections. Results indicate that the proposed MCS can provide useful information about people's opinions that are comparable to conventional opinion polls.},

Finding effective people in societies has been a key question for many groups, e.g., marketers. The research undertaken in this paper focuses on finding important nodes in a network based on their behaviour as well as the structure of the network. This paper views the propagation of information in a social network as a process of infection. The paper proposes an algorithm called the Probability Propagation Method for measuring the probability of infection of all the nodes in a network starting from a given node in the network. Then, assuming independence in activation of nodes in a network, a method is proposed for ranking nodes according to their capabilities in infecting a larger number of nodes in a network. These methods are validated using simulation software in which a non-deterministic model of information diffusion is simulated on several classes of network.},

abstract = {News articles are a captivating type of online content that capture a significant amount of Internet users' interest. They are particularly consumed by mobile users and extremely diffused through online social platforms. As a result, there is an increased interest in promptly identifying the articles that will receive a significant amount of user attention. This task falls under the broad scope of content popularity prediction and has direct implications in various contexts such as caching strategies or online advertisement policies. In this paper we address the problem of predicting the popularity of news articles based on user comments. We formulate the prediction task into a ranking problem where the goal is not to infer the precise attention that a content will receive but to accurately rank articles based on their predicted popularity. To this end, we analyze the ranking performance of three prediction models using a dataset of articles covering a four-year period and published by 20minutes.fr, an important French online news platform. Our results indicate that prediction methods improve the ranking performance and we observed that for our dataset a simple linear prediction method outperforms more dedicated prediction methods.},

abstract = {The last few years have seen an exponential increase in the amount of multimedia content that is available online thanks to collaborative-online communities such as Flickr, You Tube etc. As opposed to "pure" social networking services these collaborative-online communities not only allow users to create new social links (e.g. add other users to their friend or contact list) but also allow users to contribute multimedia content and engage in content-driven interactions (called user-to-content interactions). A good example of this can be seen in Flickr, in general and Flickr Group in particular where users can comment on or "like" an image contributed by another user. This paper looks at the task of predicting the formation of such user-to-content links in Flickr Groups. More specifically, "what is the chance that a user will comment/like an image contributed by another user?". Our proposed method for predicting user-to-content links takes into account both community effect and content effect. Our results on real-world Flickr Group data reveals that the proposed method shows good performance for the user-to-content link prediction task.},

abstract = {In modern politics, parties and individual candidates must have an online presence and usually have dedicated social media coordinators. In this context, we study the usefulness of analysing Twitter messages to identify both the characteristics of political parties and the political leaning of users. As a case study, we collected the main stream of Twitter related to the 2010 UK General Election during the associated period--gathering around 1,150,000 messages from about 220,000 users. We examined the characteristics of the three main parties in the election and highlighted the main differences between parties. First, Lab our members were the most active and influential during the election while Conservative members were the most organized to promote their activities. Second, the websites and blogs that each political party's members supported are clearly different from those that all the other political parties' members supported. From these observations, we develop a simple and practical classification method which uses the number of Twitter messages referring to a particular political party. The experimental results showed that the proposed classification method achieved about 86% classification accuracy and outperforms other classification methods that require expensive costs for tuning classifier parameters and/or knowledge about network topology.},

Such comparisons are often based on quantitative indicators, such as papers per researcher, and data normalization is very difficult to accomplish. Different approaches can provide new insight and in this paper we focus on the comparison of different scientific fields based on their research collaboration networks. We use co-authorship networks where nodes are researchers and the edges show the existing co-authorship relations between them. Our comparison methodology is based on network motifs, which are over represented patterns, or sub graphs. We derive motif fingerprints for 22 scientific fields based on 29 different small motifs found in the corresponding co-authorship networks. These fingerprints provide a metric for assessing similarity among scientific fields, and our analysis shows that the discrimination power of the 29 motif types is not identical. We use a co-authorship dataset built from over 15,361 publications inducing a co-authorship network with over 32,842 researchers. Our results also show that we can group different fields according to their fingerprints, supporting the notion that some fields present higher similarity and can be more easily compared.},

Most of the existing inference algorithms suffer from the scalability issue, making themselves computationally costly, or even infeasible, for the graphs with more than thousands of nodes. In addition, the inference result, which is typically an abstract, numerical trustworthiness score, might be difficult for the end-user to interpret. In this paper, we propose sub graph extraction to address these challenges. The core of the proposed method consists of two stages: path selection and component induction. The outputs of both stages can be used as an intermediate step to speed up a variety of existing trust inference algorithms. Our experimental evaluations on real graphs show that the proposed method can accelerate existing trust inference algorithms, while maintaining high accuracy. In addition, the extracted sub graph provides an intuitive way to interpret the resulting trustworthiness score.},

The conversational dynamics of users in fora can influence their neighbours in the underlying social network. We make use of such influence to target specific communities with information, i.e. post in them, because a post is generally shared with the community and not just with individual users. In short, we study information diffusion across communities and show that we can achieve high community (and user) spread using an efficient targeting strategy. In order to achieve this, we use a set of novel measures for cross-community influence and show that it outperforms other targeting strategies on two different data-sets: the largest Irish online discussion system, Boards.ie, and technical support fora, SAP SCN.},

This novel metric, as well as a set of further metrics we derive from it, enable the pair wise comparison of subsequent states of an evolving network in a discrete-time domain.

abstract = {Microblogging, as a new form of social media, attracts a huge number of users and becomes very popular. In this paper, we consider a fundamental social network issue that illustrates how information flows through a social media network and specify why users have different retweet behaviors. We propose to characterize social ties by using various features such as power ratio, local link structure, location, and gender. Those features can be directly extracted from users' profiles in Microblogging sites. We apply a fitted Log-linear model to describe association patterns among the features and retweet factor. Using the fitted Log-linear model, we explain why users with different profiles and link structures have different retweet behaviors. Our evaluations on Sina Weibo data set show several phenomenons.},

abstract = {We present a new probabilistic approach to modeling social interactions, that seamlessly integrates community discovery and role assignment for a deeper understanding of connectivity patterns in social networks. The devised approach is an unsupervised learning technique based on a Bayesian hierarchical model of social interactions. This model specifies an intuitive generative process, in which pairs of nodes in a social network are associated with communities as well as roles in the context of the respective communities, before that a directed interaction is possibly established between them. According to the generative semantics of the proposed model, nodes are represented as probability distributions over communities, while communities are represented as probability distributions over roles. Such distributions are unknown parameters of the proposed model, that are estimated from social-network data through approximated posterior inference and parameter estimation. A comparative evaluation over real-world social networks reveals that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of link prediction.},

abstract = {In recent years, social media websites, such as Epinions, Twitter, and Google+, have gained in popularity and have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, where rich user-generated texts are propagated through social networks. Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have been proposed and shown to be useful for text analysis. The existing topic models focus on traditional document collections, which consist of a relatively small number of long and high-quality documents. However, user-generated texts tend to be shorter and noisier than traditional content. Besides, the social networks have two novel features: context information on nodes, such as user features, and edges, such as relationship, which have not been considered by the existing topic models. In this paper, we pose the problem of finding user topics in large-scale collection of documents from online social networks. We propose a comprehensive Feature based and a Social based Topic model, taking into account the user features and social networks. We demonstrate that our models have better performance than a baseline LDA in the Epinions, Twitter, and Google+ data sets.},

abstract = {In service-based industries, churn poses a significant threat to the integrity of the user communities and profitability of the service providers. As such, research on churn prediction methods has been actively pursued, involving either intrinsic, user profile factors or extrinsic, social factors. However, existing approaches often address each type of factors separately, thus lacking a comprehensive view of churn behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new churn prediction approach based on collective classification (CC), which accounts for both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors by utilizing the local features of, and dependencies among, individuals during prediction steps. We evaluate our CC approach using real data provided by an established mobile social networking site, with a primary focus on prediction of churn in chat activities. Our results demonstrate that using CC and social features derived from interaction records and network structure yields substantially improved prediction in comparison to using conventional classification and user profile features only.},

We do so by observing the temporal dynamics of the conversation, and performing a clustering so as to judge how much time is required before reasonable conclusions can be drawn about the level of interest surrounding an episode.

abstract = {The network around an entrepreneur is conceptualized as having structural properties of size, diversity and composition as network components of varying prominence in the entrepreneur's network. These properties are important by impacting entrepreneurs' performance in terms of innovation, exporting and expectations for growth. In our research-consortium Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, a sample of 35430 entrepreneurs in 42 countries reported on relations with up to 20 advisors. Cluster analysis of their relations discerned five components: a private network of advice relations with spouse, parents, other family and friends, a work-place network of boss, coworkers, starters and mentors, a professional network of accountants, lawyers, banks, investors, counselors and researchers, a market network of competitors, collaborators, suppliers and customers, and an international network of advice relations with persons abroad and persons who have come from abroad. Entrepreneurs' networking is embedded in their cultures with the dimension of trust and the dimension of traditionality versus rationality. Rationality and trust are hypothesized to enhance size and diversity of networks and prominence of the work-place network, of the professional network, of the market network and of the international network, but to reduce prominence of the private network, that is, the private network is hypothesized to be more prominent in a culture of traditionality and in a culture of distrust in others beyond family and friends. Cultural effects on networking are tested as macro-to-micro effects in two-level mixed linear models with fixed effects of national levels of rationality and trust and individual-level variables as controls and random effects of country, where the dependent variables are the properties of the networks. We find that rationality promotes diversity of networks and prominence of work-place network, professional network, market network and apparently also international network, but reduces prominence of the private network. Trust increases size of the networks, diversity of networks, prominence of market network and apparently also work-place network and professional network, but reduces prominence of the private network. These cultural effects are larger than most effects of entrepreneurs' individual characteristics.},

Most of contemporary community detection algorithms employ single optimization criteria (e.g., modularity), which may have fundamental disadvantages. This paper considers the community detection process as a Multi-Objective optimization Problem (MOP). To solve the community detection problem this study used modified harmony search algorithm (HAS), the original HAS often converges to local optima which is a disadvantage with this method. To avoid this shortcoming the HAS was combined with a Chaotic Local Search (CLS). In the proposed algorithm an external repository considered to save non-dominated solutions found during the search process and a fuzzy clustering technique was used to control the size of the repository. The experiments in synthetic and real networks show that the proposed multi-objective community detection algorithm is able to discover more accurate community structures.},

abstract = {The availability of massive network and mobility data from diverse domains has fostered the analysis of human behaviors and interactions. This data availability leads to challenges in the knowledge discovery community. Several different analyses have been performed on the traces of human trajectories, such as understanding the real borders of human mobility or mining social interactions derived from mobility and vice versa. However, the data quality of the digital traces of human mobility has a dramatic impact over the knowledge that it is possible to mine, and this issue has not been thoroughly tackled so far in literature. In this paper, we mine and analyze with complex network techniques a large dataset of human trajectories, a GPS dataset from more than 150k vehicles in Italy. We build a multi resolution grid and we map the trajectories with several complex networks, by connecting the different areas of our region of interest. Then we analyze the structural properties of these networks and the quality of the borders it is possible to infer from them. The result is a significant advancement in our understanding of the data transformation process that is needed to connect mobility with social network analysis and mining.},

Unfortunately computing MPIDS in Power-Law graph is a NP-Complete problem. Recently, one greedy algorithm has been proposed in the literature for the PIDS problem with time complexity of O(n^3). In this paper, we propose a new greedy algorithm for PIDS which has outstanding time complexity of O(n^2). Theoretical analysis and simulation results are also presented to verify our approach's efficiency. The simulation results reveal that compared to other algorithm, our algorithm efficiently reduces the PIDS size.},

abstract = {Grouping data points is one of the fundamental tasks in data mining, which is commonly known as clustering if data points are described by attributes. When dealing with interrelated data that does not have any attributes and is represented in the form of nodes and their relationships, this task is also referred to as community mining. There has been a considerable number of approaches proposed in recent years for mining communities in a given network. But little work has been done on how to evaluate community mining results. The common practice is to use an agreement measure to compare the mining result against a ground truth, however, the ground truth is not known in most of the real world applications. In this paper, we investigate relative clustering quality measures defined for evaluation of clustering data points with attributes and propose proper adaptations to make them applicable in the context of social networks. Not only these relative criteria could be used as metrics for evaluating quality of the groupings but also they could be used as objectives for designing new community mining algorithms.},

abstract = {nowadays, social networks are more and more widely used as a solution for enriching users\^{a} profiles in systems such as recommender systems or personalized systems. For an unknown user\^{a} s interest, the user\^{a} s social network can be a meaningful data source for deriving that interest. However, in the literature very few techniques are designed to meet this solution. Existing techniques usually focus on people individually selected in the user\^{a} s social network, and strongly depend on each author\^{a} s objective. To improve these techniques, we propose to use a community based algorithm that is applied to a part of the user\^{a} s social network (egocentric network) and that can be reused for any purpose (e.g. personalization, recommendation). We compute weighted user\^{a} s interests from these communities by considering their semantics (interests related to communities) and their structural measures (e.g. centrality measures) in the egocentric network graph. A first experiment conducted in Facebook demonstrates the usefulness of this technique compared to individuals based techniques, and the influence of structural measures (related to communities) on the quality of derived profiles. The results also raise the problem of users\^{a} privacy in platforms such as online social networks. To enable users to better protect their privacy, these platforms should provide their users with a way to also make their friend list private.},

While it is conceptually straightforward, and can be elegantly expressed using clique graphs, certain aspects of k-clique percolation are computationally challenging in practice. In this paper we investigate aspects of empirical social networks, such as the large numbers of overlapping maximal cliques contained within them, that make clique percolation, and clique graph representations, computationally expensive. We motivate a simple algorithm to conduct clique percolation, and investigate its performance compared to current best-in-class algorithms. We present improvements to this algorithm, which allow us to perform k-clique percolation on much larger empirical datasets. Our approaches perform much better than existing algorithms on networks exhibiting pervasively overlapping community structure, especially for higher values of k. However, clique percolation remains a hard computational problem, current algorithms still scale worse than some other overlapping community finding algorithms.},

In this paper, we develop and test a model to estimate the propensity of a user to stop using the social platform in a near future. This problem is called churn prediction and has been extensively studied in telecommunication networks. We focus here on building a statistical model estimating the probability that a user will leave the social network in the near future. The model is based on graph attributes extracted in the user's vicinity. We present a novel algorithm to accurately detect overlapping local communities in social graphs. Our algorithm outperforms the state of the art methods and is able to deal with pathological cases which can occur in real networks. We show that using attributes computed from the local community around the user allows to build a robust statistical model to predict churn.

Notable models include [1] and [2] achieving graphs with power-law degree distribution using preferential attachment and small-world characteristics using randomized rewiring of a regular ring lattice respectively. In contrast to a body of follow-up research which refine upon these seminal works to better capture the graph structure and characteristics (such as improving clustering coefficient by considering social triads along with preferential attachment [3]), this work aims additionally to model the geographic spread in social networks. With increased mobility in our society as well as enhanced communication opportunities social networks are increasingly spread all over the globe. Synthetic graphs imitating real-world social network characteristics are often used for driving simulations for planning and decision support. Incorporating geographic spread can facilitate better infrastructure provisioning in distributed systems supporting social and collaborative applications or model information of malware diffusion, word-of-mouth marketing, etc. The proposed model is tunable and modular. The model can be tuned to produce graphs with different geographic spread. The model is modular in the sense that existing geographic spread agnostic social network models can be plugged into our model to achieve desirable geographic spread in addition to other characteristics (such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient) that such a model would natively support.},

In previous work, we have shown that personality can be predicted relatively accurately by analyzing social media profiles. We demonstrated this using public data from facebook profiles and text from Twitter streams. As social situations are crucial in the formation of one's personality, one's social behavior could be a strong indicator of her personality. Given most users of social media sites typically have a large number of friends and followers, considering only these aspects may not provide an accurate picture of personality. To overcome this problem, we develop a set of measures based on one's behavior towards her friends and followers. We introduce a number of measures that are based on the intensity and number of social interactions one has with friends along a number of dimensions such as reciprocity and priority. We analyze these features along with a set of features based on the textual analysis of the messages sent by the users. We show that behavioral features are very useful in determining personality and perform as well as textual features.},

abstract = {The modern age has seen an exponential growth of social network data available on the web. Analysis of these networks reveal important structural information about these networks in particular and about our societies in general. More often than not, analysis of these networks is concerned in identifying similarities among social networks and how they are different from other networks such as protein interaction networks, computer networks and food web. In this paper, our objective is to perform a critical analysis of different social networks using structural metrics in an effort to highlight their similarities and differences. We use five different social network datasets which are contextually and semantically different from each other. We then analyze these networks using a number of different network statistics and metrics. Our results show that although these social networks have been constructed from different contexts, they are structurally similar.},

In this paper, we explain how traces of peer-to-peer file sharing may be used to this goal. We also perform simulations to assess the relevance of the standard SIR model to mimic key properties of real spreading cascades. We examine the impact of the network topology on observed properties and finally turn to the evaluation of two heterogeneous extensions of the SIR model. We conclude that all the models tested failed to reproduce key properties of such cascades: real spreading cascades are relatively "elongated" compared to simulated ones. We have also observed some interesting similarities common to all SIR models tested.},

We have collected real Facebook profile information and photo privacy policies of 222 participants, through their consent in our Facebook survey application posted on Mechanical Turk. Our data analysis shows that users' customized friend lists are less frequently created and have fewer overlaps as compared to Facebook created friend lists. Also, users do not place all of their friends into lists. Moreover, friends in more than one friend lists have higher values of node betweenness and outgoing to incoming edge ratio values among all the friends of a particular user. Last but not the least, friend list and user based exceptions are less frequently used in policies as compared to allowing all friends, friends of friends and everyone to view photos.},

abstract = {As a media and communication platform, microblog is more and more popular around the world. Users can follow anyone ranges from well-known individuals to real friends, and read their tweets without their permission. Most users follow a large number of celebrities and public media in microblog, however, these celebrities do not necessarily follow all their fans. Such one-way relationship abounds in the user network and is displayed in the forms of users' followees and followers, which make it difficult to identify users' real friends who are contained in the merged list of followees and followers. The aim of this paper is to propose a general algorithm for mining users' real friends in social media and dividing them into different social circles automatically according to the closeness of their relationships. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we build a microblog application which presents the social circles for users identified by the algorithm and enable users to modify the proposed results according to her/his real social circles. We demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to traditional clustering method in terms of F measure and Mean Average Precision.},

Here we present a detailed study on examining the existence and evolution of social macrostructures in an empirical online social network, and exploring how they can be explained by network micro structural properties, i.e. nodal in degree and out degree and dyadic feature. We establish the micro-macro linkage by analyzing the network triadic patterns. Based on a novel clustering coefficient based network sampling approach, we show that the distribution of observed triad census in our data is low dimensional and can be greatly explained by network dyadic properties. In a time series analysis, we observe that our network exhibits strong tendencies towards balanced, transitive and clustered social macrostructure given the nodal and dyadic characteristics. Our findings supplement the studies on structural properties of online social network by providing more insights on the relation between network macrostructures and the micro-level social processes that result in them. And they form the basis to understand better how online social media systems change the information and communication fabric of our society.},

Incorrect privacy policy settings can easily lead to leaks in private and personal information. At the same time, being too restrictive would reduce the benefits of online social networks. This is further complicated with the growing adoption of social networks and with the rapid growth in information uploading and sharing. The problem of facilitating policy settings has attracted numerous access control, and human computer interaction researchers. The solutions proposed range from usable interfaces for policy settings to automated policy settings. We propose a fine grained policy recommendation system that is based on an iterative semi-supervised learning approach that uses the social graph propagation properties. Active learning and social graph properties were used to detect the most informative instances to be labeled as training sets. We implemented and tested our approach using real Facebook dataset. We compared our proposed approach to supervised learning and random walk approaches. Our proposed approaches provided high accuracy and precision when compared to the other approaches.},

abstract = {As social networking is moving into the web, the study and exploitation of social correlation has emerged as a hot research topic. Most of these work consider binary social relations, called "friendships". However, online users tend to establish many friendships of varying degree of strength, e.g., relatives, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances. We argue that, due to their different degree of strength, different friend relationships will have greatly varying degrees of correlation and should be distinguished. Besides, social correlation is not the only factor driving user behavior. In this paper, we address the problem of learning the strength of the social correlation, user, item, and sparsity factors in online social networks. We propose a probabilistic model, Factor Weight Model, for learning these strengths which maximize the joint probability of the observed user behavior, i.e., actions on items. Different from existing methods, our model considers not only social correlation, but it also considers the other factors affecting user behavior. We have conducted experiments on four real life data sets from Epinions, Flixster, Flickr, and Digg. Our experiments prove the superiority of our model over a state-of-the-art method in terms of action prediction. We also analyze the contributions of the various factors for the prediction performance.},

We argue for the use of precision-recall threshold curves and associated areas in lieu of receiver operating characteristic curves due to the extreme imbalance of the link prediction classification problem. We provide empirical examples of how current methods lead to questionable conclusions, how the fallacy of these conclusions is illuminated by methods we propose, and suggest a fair and consistent framework for link prediction evaluation for longitudinal and non-longitudinal network data sets.},

Thus, the hidden knowledge contained in social network data can be considered as an important resource to discover the formation of such positive and negative links. In this work, an inductive learning framework is presented to suggest 'friends' and 'foes' links to individuals which envisage the social balance among users in the corresponding friends and foes networks (FFN). First we learn a model by applying C4.5, the most widely adopted decision tree based classification algorithm, to exploit the feature patterns presented in the users' FFN and utilizing it to further predict friend/foe relationship of unknown links. Secondly, a quantitative measure of social balance, balance index, is used to support our decision on the recommendation of new friends and foes links (FFL) to avoid possible imbalance in the extended FFN with newly suggested links. The proposed scheme ensures that the recommendation of new FFLs either maintains or enhances the balancing factor of the existing FFN of an individual. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.},

abstract = {More and more communities use internet based services and infrastructure for communication and collaboration. All these activities leave digital traces that are of interest for research as real world data sources that can be processed automatically or semi-automatically. Since productive online communities (such as open source developer teams) tend to support the establishment of ties between actors who work on or communicate about the same or similar objects, social network analysis is a frequently used research methodology in this field. A typical application of SNA techniques is the detection of cohesive subgroups of actors (also called "community detection"). A relatively new method for detecting cohesive subgroups is the Clique Percolation Method (CPM), which allows for detecting overlapping subgroups. We have used CPM to analyze data from some open source developer communities (mailing lists and log files) and have compared the results for varied time windows of measurement. The influence of the time span of data capturing/aggregation can be compared to photography: A certain minimal window size is needed to get a clear image with enough "light" (i.e. dense enough interaction data), whereas for very long time spans the image will be blurred because subgroup membership will indeed change during the time span (corresponding to a moving target). In this sense, our target parameter is "resolution" of subgroup structures. We have identified several indicators for good resolution. Applying these indicators to the different CPM results shows the best resolution is a time span of around 2-3 months. In general, this value will vary for different types of communities with different communication frequency and behavior. Following our findings, an explicit analysis and comparison of the influence of time window for different communities may be used to better adjust analysis techniques for the communities at hand.},

abstract = {Enabling accurate analysis of social network data while preserving differential privacy has been challenging since graph features such as clustering coefficient or modularity often have high sensitivity, which is different from traditional aggregate functions (e.g., count and sum) on tabular data. In this paper, we treat a graph statistics as a function $f$ and develop a divide and conquer approach to enforce differential privacy. The basic procedure of this approach is to first decompose the target computation $f$ into several less complex unit computations $f1, cdots, f_m$ connected by basic mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), then perturb the output of each $f_i$ with Lap lace noise derived from its own sensitivity value and the distributed privacy threshold $epsilon_i$, and finally combine those perturbed $f_i$ as the perturbed output of computation $f$. We examine how various operations affect the accuracy of complex computations. When unit computations have large global sensitivity values, we enforce the differential privacy by calibrating noise based on the smooth sensitivity, rather than the global sensitivity. By doing this, we achieve the strict differential privacy guarantee with smaller magnitude noise. We illustrate our approach by using clustering coefficient, which is a popular statistics used in social network analysis. Empirical evaluations show the developed divide and conquer approach outperforms the direct approach.},

abstract = {Early Internet architecture design goals did not put security as a high priority. However, today Internet security is a quickly growing concern. The prevalence of Internet attacks has increased significantly, but still the challenge of detecting such attacks generally falls on the end hosts and service providers, requiring system administrators to detect and block attacks on their own. In particular, as social networks have become central hubs of information and communication, they are increasingly the target of attention and attacks. This creates a challenge of carefully distinguishing malicious connections from normal ones. Previous work has shown that for a variety of Internet attacks, there is a small subset of connection measurements that are good indicators of whether a connection is part of an attack or not. In this paper we look at the effectiveness of using two different co-clustering algorithms to both cluster connections as well as mark which connection measurements are strong indicators of what makes any given cluster anomalous relative to the total data set. We run experiments with these co-clustering algorithms on the KDD 1999 Cup data set. In our experiments we find that soft co-clustering, running on samples of data, finds consistent parameters that are strong indicators of anomalous detections and creates clusters, that are highly pure. When running hard co-clustering on the full data set (over 100 runs), we on average have one cluster with 92.44% attack connections and the other with 75.84% normal connections. These results are on par with the KDD 1999 Cup winning entry, showing that co-clustering is a strong, unsupervised method for separating normal connections from anomalous ones. Finally, we believe that the ideas presented in this work may inspire research for anomaly detection in social networks, such as identifying spammers and fraudsters.},

abstract = {Privacy of social network data is a growing concern which threatens to limit access to this valuable data source. Analysis of the graph structure of social networks can provide valuable information for revenue generation and social science research, but unfortunately, ensuring this analysis does not violate individual privacy is difficult. Simply anonymizing graphs or even releasing only aggregate results of analysis may not provide sufficient protection. Differential privacy is an alternative privacy model, popular in data-mining over tabular data, which uses noise to obscure individuals' contributions to aggregate results and offers a very strong mathematical guarantee that individuals' presence in the data-set is hidden. Analyses that were previously vulnerable to identification of individuals and extraction of private data may be safely released under differential-privacy guarantees. We review two existing standards for adapting differential privacy to network data and analyse the feasibility of several common social-network analysis techniques under these standards. Additionally, we propose out-link privacy, a novel standard for differential privacy over network data, and introduce two powerful out-link private algorithms for common network analysis techniques that were infeasible to privatize under previous differential privacy standards.},

abstract = {In recent years, concerns of privacy have become more prominent for social networks. Anonymizing a graph meaningfully is a challenging problem, as the original graph properties must be preserved as well as possible. We introduce a generalization of the degree anonymization problem posed by Liu and Terzi. In this problem, our goal is to anonymize a given subset of nodes while adding the fewest possible number of edges. The main contribution of this paper is an efficient algorithm for this problem by exploring its connection with the degree-constrained sub graph problem. Our experimental results show that our algorithm performs very well on many instances of social network data.},

abstract = {Privacy preserving analysis of a social network aims at a better understanding of the network and its behavior, while at the same time protecting the privacy of its individuals. We propose an anonymization method for weighted graphs, i.e., for social networks where the strengths of links are important. This is in contrast with many previous studies which only consider unweighted graphs. Weights can be essential for social network analysis, but they pose new challenges to privacy preserving network analysis. In this paper, we mainly consider prevention of identity disclosure, but we also touch on edge and edge weight disclosure in weighted graphs. We propose a method that provides k-anonymity of nodes against attacks where the adversary has information about the structure of the network, including its edge weights. The method is efficient, and it has been evaluated in terms of privacy and utility on real word datasets.},

While these social networks are promising privacy through privacy agreements, everyday new privacy leakages are emerging. Ideally, online social networks should be able to manage and maintain their agreements through well-founded methods. However, the dynamic nature of the online social networks is making it difficult to keep private information contained. We have developed PROTOSS, a run time tool for detecting privacy leakages in online social networks. PROTOSS captures relations among users, their privacy agreements with an online social network operator, and domain-based inference rules. It then uses model checking to detect if an online social network will leak private information.},

abstract = {Graph mining is a popular technique for discovering the hidden structures or important instances in a graph, but the computational efficiency is usually a cause for concern when dealing with large-scale graphs containing billions of entities. Cloud computing is widely regarded as a feasible solution to the problem. In this work, we present an open source graph mining library called the MapReduce Graph Mining Framework (MGMF) to be a robust and efficient MapReduce-based graph mining tool. We start from dividing graph mining algorithms into four categories and designing a MapReduce framework for algorithms in each category. The experimental results show that MGMF is 3 to 20 times more efficient than PEGASUS, a state-of-the-art library for graph mining on MapReduce. Moreover, it provides better coverage of different graph mining algorithms. We also validate our framework on billion-scaled networks to demonstrate that it is scalable to the number of machines. Fur-thermore, we test and compare the feasibility between single ma-chine and the cloud computing technique. The effects of different file input formats for MapReduce are investigated as well. Our implemented open-source library can be downloaded from http://mslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~noahsark/MGMF/.},

abstract = {Researchers have discovered, in recent years, the advantages of modeling complex systems using heterogeneous information networks. These networks are comprised of heterogeneous sets of nodes and edges that better represent the different entities and relationships often found in the real world. Although heterogeneous networks provide a richer semantic view of the data, the added complexity makes it difficult to directly apply existing techniques that work well on homogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a graph modification process that alters an existing heterogeneous bibliographic network into another network, with the purpose of highlighting the important relations in the bibliographic network. Several importance scores, some adopted from existing work and others defined in this work, are then used to measure the importance of links in the modified network. The link prediction problem is studied on the modified network by implementing a random walk-based algorithm on the network. The importance scores and the structure of the modified graph are used to guide a random walker towards relevant parts of the graph, i.e. towards nodes to which new links will be created in the future. The different properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated experimentally on a real world bibliographic network, the DBLP. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised technique as well as various approaches based on topology and node attributes.},

abstract = {Social networks have demonstrated in the last few years to be a powerful and flexible concept useful to represent and analyze data emerging form social interactions and social activities. The study of these networks can thus provide a deeper understanding of many emergent global phenomena. The amount of data available in the form of social networks data is growing by the day, and this poses many computational challenging problems for their analysis. In fact many analysis tools suitable to analyze small to medium sized networks are inefficient for large social networks. The computation of the betweenness centrality index is a well established method for network data analysis and it is also important as subroutine in more advanced algorithms, such as the Girvan-Newman method for graph partitioning. In this paper we present a new approach for the computation of the betweenness centrality, which speeds up considerably Brandes' algorithm (the current state of the art) in the context of social networks. Our approach exploits the natural sparsity of the data to algebraically (and efficiently) determine the betweenness of those nodes forming trees (tree-nodes) in the social network. Moreover, for the residual network, which is often of much smaller size, we modify directly the Brandes' algorithm so that we can remove the nodes already processed and perform the computation of the shortest paths only for the residual nodes. Tests conducted on a sample of publicly available large networks from the Stanford repository show that improvements of a factor ranging between 2 and 5 are possible on several such graphs, when the sparsity, measured by the ratio of tree-nodes to the total number of nodes, is in a medium range (30% to 50%). For some large networks from the Stanford repository and for a sample of social networks provided by Sistemi Territoriali with high sparsity (80% and above) tests show that our algorithm consistently runs between one and two orders of magnitude faster than the current state of the art exact algorithm.},

Participants may not have a priori knowledge that allows them to select the right talks or informal interactions with other participants. In this paper we present the context-aware mobile recommendation services (CAMRS) based on the current context (whereabouts at the venue, popularity and activities of talks and presentations) sensed at the conference venue. Additionally, we augment the current context with the academic community context of conference participants which is inferred by using social network analysis and link prediction on large-scale co-authorship and citation networks of participants. By combining the dynamic and social context of participants, we are able to recommend talks and people that may be interesting to a particular participant. We evaluated CAMRS using data from two large digital libraries - the DBLP and CiteSeerX, and participants from two conferences - ICWL 2010 and EC-TEL 2011. The result shows that the new approach can recommend novel talks and helps participants in establishing new connections at conference venue.},

abstract = {Two rating patterns exist in the user-item rating matrix and influence each other: the personal rating patterns are hidden in each user's entire rating history, while the global rating patterns are hidden in the entire user-item rating matrix. In this paper, a Rating Pattern Subspace is proposed to model both of the rating patterns simultaneously by iteratively refining each other with an EM-like algorithm. Firstly, a low-rank subspace is built up to model the global rating patterns from the whole user-item rating matrix, then, the projection for each user on the subspace is refined individually based on his/her own entire rating history. After that, the refined user projections on the subspace are used to improve the modelling of the global rating patterns. Iteratively, we can obtain a well-trained low-rank Rating Pattern Subspace, which is capable of modelling both the personal and the global rating patterns. Based on this subspace, we propose a RapSVD algorithm to generate Top-N recommendations, and the experiment results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art Top-N recommendation methods in terms of accuracy, especially on long tail item recommendations.},

Since the number of interactions is much less than the possible number of interactions, the graphs and matrices used in the analyses are usually sparse. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation of a sparse-matrix computation which arises in our publicly available citation recommendation service called the advisor. The recommendation algorithm uses a sparse matrix generated from the citation graph. We observed that the nonzero pattern of this matrix is highly irregular and the computation suffers from high number of cache misses. We propose techniques for storing the matrix in memory efficiently and reducing the number of cache misses. Experimental results show that our techniques are highly efficient on reducing the query processing time which is highly crucial for a web service.},

A social group is an entity that defines a group based on demographic, ethnic, cultural, religious, age, or other characteristics. In the PDGP framework, query results are filtered and ranked based on the preferences of the social groups to which the user belongs. The user's social groups are inferred implicitly by the system without involving the user. PDGP constructs the social groups and identifies their preferences dynamically on the fly. These preferences are determined from the preferences of the social groups' member users using a group modeling strategy. PDGP can be used for various practical applications, such as Internet or other businesses that market preference-driven products. We experimentally compared PDGP with an existing system. Results showed marked improvement.},

abstract = {Social networks are dynamic structures that contain a set of entities and links. In such a dynamic environment, a specific node or a group of nodes can play an important role in the information flow transmission within the network and therefore, its disappearance may lead to a disconnected network or a breakdown in the information flow. The objective of this paper is to extend our previous work on managing a node disappearance to handling the disappearance of a group of nodes. The proposed approach relies on the role played by a group of nodes to conduct network changes and maintain the network connected while restoring the information flow with a similar quality as before the group disappearance. We consider two situations (only one versus many communities) and categorize groups of nodes into three classes (scattered, contiguous and hybrid). Hence, we manage a group disappearance with respect to its class and the network topology by adding new links in a parsimonious way and finding a substitute for a leaving group. Our approach differs from existing link prediction solutions by the fact that it uses the information flow quality as a key performance indicator to identify the potential links to add and/or the possible substitute to a disappearing group. We implement a prototype by using an open source social network analysis library (NetworkX) and we validate our solution through experiments. The results show the benefits of our solution in terms of response time and the number of added links.},

In this new scenario, the role of Social Network Analysis is of course still crucial but the preliminary step to do is designing a good way to crawl the underlying graph. While this aspect has been deeply investigated in the field of social networks, it is an open issue when moving towards SISs. Indeed, we cannot expect that a crawling strategy which is good for social networks, is still valid in a Social Internetworking Scenario, due to its specific topological features. In this paper, we first confirm the above claim and, then, define a new crawling strategy specifically conceived for SISs. Finally, we show that it fully overcomes the drawbacks of the state-of-the-art crawling strategies.},

So far, very little is known about the relationship between sentiments and network emergence, dissemination patterns and possible differences between positive and negative sentiments. The dissemination patterns analyzed in this study consist of network motifs based on triples of actors and the ties among them. These motifs are associated with common social network effects to derive meaningful insights about dissemination activities. The data basis includes several thousand social networks with textual messages classified according to embedded positive and negative sentiments. Based on this data, sub-networks are extracted and analyzed with a dynamic network motif analysis to determine dissemination patterns and associated network effects. Results indicate that the emergence of digital social networks exhibits a strong tendency towards reciprocity, followed by the dominance of hierarchy as an intermediate step leading to social clustering with hubs and transitivity effects for both positive and negative sentiments to the same extend. Sentiments embedded in exchanged textual messages do only play a secondary role in network emergence and do not express differences regarding the emergence of network patterns.},

Barabasi-Albert model is a generative procedure that uses preferential attachment based on degree and one can use this model to generate networks with power-law degree distribution. In this model, the network is assumed to grow one node every time step. After the evolution of such a network, it is impossible for one to predict the exact order of node arrivals. We present in this article, a novel strategy to partially predict the order of node arrivals in such an evolved network. We show that our proposed method outperforms other centrality measure based approaches. We bin the nodes and predict the order of node arrivals between the bins with an accuracy of above 80%.},

We propose here Out skewer, a new approach based on the notion of skewness (a measure of the symmetry of a distribution) and its evolution when extremal values are removed one by one. Our method is easy to set up, it requires no prior knowledge on the system, and it may be used on-line. We illustrate its performance on two data sets representative of many use-cases: evolution of ego-centered views of the internet topology, and logs of queries entered into a search engine.},

abstract = {Decentralized Online Social Networks (OSNs) attempt to improve user privacy and security. One example is Vegas, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) OSN which attempts to bring its users back into complete control of the data they share. Due to its decentralized characteristics, P2P OSNs cannot support social search functions in the same way users of centralized OSNs like Facebook are familiar with. Well-known and efficient P2P search algorithms cannot always be applied as knowledge about the structure of the social graph can be very limited. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of forwarding strategies to enable social search for secure and privacy preserving P2P OSNs. We compare well-known metrics from the field of unstructured P2P networks with metrics from the area of social network analysis and evaluate their applicability for P2P OSNs like Vegas. We simulate all metrics on four distinct datasets which were generated artificially from the ER- and the BA-model and from crawling data of Lastfm and Flickr. Our evaluation shows that prioritization based on knowledge from the ego network often yields the best results.},

abstract = {In large-scale networks, certain topological patterns may occur more frequently than expected from a null model that preserves global (such as the density of the graph) and local (such as the connectivity of each node) properties of the graph. These network motifs are the building blocks of large-scale networks and may confer functional/mechanistic implications of their underlying processes. Despite active investigations and rich literature in systems biology, network motifs are less explored in social network studies. In this work, we modified and improved the method from Milo et al. 2002 to detect significantly enriched motifs in both directed and undirected networks. We applied this method to identify 3-node and 4-node motifs from the datasets of 18 networks (4 directed and 14 undirected) covering social interactions, co-authorships, web document hyperlinks, neuronal circuitry, protein-protein interactions (PPI), trophic relations in a food web, and others. Presence and absence of enriched motifs provide rich information regarding each type of network relations. In undirected networks, triangles are enriched in almost all datasets, suggesting the prevalence of transitivity in diverse networks. However, 4-node structures lacking transitivity--diamonds and stars--are also enriched in the majority of undirected networks. In directed networks, variations of feed-forward loops are over-represented in the networks of web document and political web log hyperlinks as well as neuronal connections. In contrast, the food web is enriched with unidirectional motifs with distinct trophic levels. These results reveal the nature of distinct types of networks and invite further explorations on the relations of network structures and types of relations.},

abstract = {Though centrality of vertices in social networks has been extensively studied, all past efforts assume that centrality of a vertex solely depends on the structural properties of graphs. However, with the emergence of online "semantic" social networks where vertices have properties (e.g. gender, age, and other demographic data) and edges are labeled with relationships (e.g. friend, follows) and weights (measuring the strength of a relationship), it is essential that we take semantics into account when measuring centrality. Moreover, the centrality of a vertex should be tied to a diffusive property in the network - a Twitter vertex may have high centrality w.r.t. jazz, but low centrality w.r.t. Republican politics. In this paper, we propose a new notion of diffusion centrality (DC) in which semantic aspects of the graph, as well as a diffusion model of how a diffusive property p is spreading, are used to characterize the centrality of vertices. We present a hyper graph based algorithm to compute DC and report on a prototype implementation and experiments showing how we can compute DCs (using real YouTube data) on social networks in a reasonable amount of time. We compare DC with classical centrality measures like degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector and stress centrality and show that in all cases, DC produces higher quality results. DC is also often faster to compute than both betweenness, closeness and stress centrality, but slower than degree and eigenvector centrality.},

Empirical mobile traffic data illuminate exceptional behavior, just after the bombing in Oslo. We find that in the minutes after the bombing people called ties that were (1) close socially and (2) perceived to be in danger, that is, people who were close to the bombing point. Our main findings: (1) individuals first focus on their single closest contact ('best friend'), but, soon after, switch to spending more mobile communication resources than average on contacts ranked 2 -- 5. (2) we see clearly a large increase (over typical) in traffic to and from, and not least within, the affected area (Oslo) -- in some cases more than a 300% increase, right after the bombing. Interestingly, we also find a marked increase in traffic for relationships where both persons were outside of Oslo. All these results illustrate the importance of social contact in this highly unusual situation. This paper underscores how the mobile phone is an instrument of the intimate sphere. The situation on the 22nd of July in Oslo is a prime example of an unexpected situation, where individuals use the mobile to get critical information on their loved ones in their core network.},

abstract = {Several important social network data sets have an inherent bipartite structure: for example, agents are affiliated with societies, authors write articles, customers buy, rent, or rate products. One commonly used network analytic approach to their analysis involves projecting them, i.e., deducing relations between actors of the same type (e.g. societies, articles, or products). Some of the available large scale data sets not only represent one, but several distinct relations between the same actors thereby calling for a projection method that accounts for the multiple nature of the relations. In this article we present a statistical method that properly extends a projection algorithm developed for bipartite networks containing one single type of relation. We show the stability of the proposed method on synthetic data. Then, we apply it to a real-world network of users rating films, namely a subset of the Netflix prize data set. We show that there is a gain from differentiating between the relation types. Based on the assumption that co-ratings of films contain information about the films' similarity, we analyze the co-liking and co-disliking structures obtained by the new one-mode projection. We find that the projections of concordant ratings show a high clustering coefficient while discordant co-ratings have a very small one. This result indicates that the assumption is valid and that thus the new one-mode projection can be used as basis for recommendations.},

abstract = {In this paper we study network games where agents with different skills come together to cooperate and yet competitively pursue individual goals. We propose a multi-agent based utilitarian approach to model the payoff allocation problem for a class of such games where the capabilities of the agents and the payoffs are not known with certainty. The primary objective is to maximize a linear sum of the expected utilities of risk-averse agents, and we consider constant risk-aversion with exponential utility functions. We pose the problem as a stochastic cooperative game which is solved in two phases. In the first phase we apply a learning mechanism on this 'social' network of fully connected agents to arrive at a consensus on the capability of every agent in the coalition thus resolving uncertainty in capabilities. Agents initially start with a social influence matrix reflecting the influence agents have on each other and prior subjective beliefs of the capabilities of the others and these beliefs evolve through a process of interaction. We use a variant of the DeGroot algorithm to show that over time learning results in a dynamic update of the beliefs and the social influence matrix leading to a consensus. We provide theoretical convergence proofs for the algorithm. The second phase involves optimizing a capability-weighted sum of the expected utilities of the agents to achieve a group Pareto optimal solution. In this paper we propose a new framework called the Capability Weighted Group Utility Maximizer developed around Borch's theorem borrowed from the actuarial world of insurance to obtain a fair distribution of the stochastic payoffs once a consensus is reached on the capabilities of the agents in the coalition.},

On the one hand the dynamics of the network is related to the movements of individuals in a social space that lead ephemeral social proximity contacts. On the other hand the diffusion phenomenon is studied through the epidemic paradigm. The results obtained by simulations provide original insight about how and why the "social dynamics" of individuals, related to the proximity in a social space and its evolutions, influences diffusion phenomena through a population.},

abstract = {The social network represents various relationships between users, and community discovery is one of the most popular tasks analyzing these relationships. The relationships are either explicit (e.g., friends) or implicit, and we focus on community discovery with implicit relationships. Here, the key issue is how to extract the relationships between users. A user is typically represented by his/her profile, and the similarity between user profiles is measured. In most algorithms, a user has a single profile aggregating all the information about the user. For example, a profile for a researcher is a list of papers he/she wrote. This setting, however, oversimplifies the multiple characteristics of a man since individual characteristics are mixed up. In this paper, we propose the notion and method of profile decomposition, which divides a profile into a set of sub-profiles so that they represent individual characteristics precisely. Then, we develop a community discovery algorithm, which we call DecompClus, based on profile decomposition. Using a real data set of CiteULike, we show that our proposed algorithm can precisely distinguish multiple research interests of a user and discover communities corresponding to each interest, whereas previous algorithms cannot. Overall, profile decomposition enables us to find fine-granularity user communities, thus improving the accuracy of community discovery.},

First, we use axiomatic foundations to `rigorously' establish shorter, strongly-connected evolutions. In the second step, we use heuristics to combine these shorter evolutions to form longer evolutions. We apply the procedure on data generated from two networks - the DBLP co-authorship database and Live Journal blog data. We visually validate our algorithms by examining the topic evolution of the associated documents. Our results demonstrate that our algorithms, based solely on structural properties of the data (who interacts with whom), are able to track thematic trends in the literature. We then use a machine learning framework to identify the structural features of the early stages of a community's evolution are most useful for predicting the lifetime of the community. We find that (in order) size, intensity and stability are the most important features.},

The government funds billions of dollars every year to lead research initiatives that will shape the future. In this paper, we analyze the funds distributed by the National Science Foundation (NSF), a major source of research funding in the States, to understand the collaboration patterns among researchers and institutions.

We further analyze the directorates to identify the differences in collaboration trends between disciplines.},

abstract = {The evaluation of novel algorithms, protocols, applications, or security attacks in context of Online Social Networks (OSN) necessitates datasets that represent a realistic snapshot of the underlying social graph. As crawling social graphs can become a time and resource consuming task, only a few anonymized datasets exist which are shared among the research community. Besides concerns about de-anonymization attacks on crawled graphs and the fact that such datasets cannot satisfy the statistical confidence in simulation results, more and more secure and privacy-preserving Peer-to-Peer (P2P) OSN architectures emerge that do not facilitate crawling of social graph data at all. In order to evaluate new metrics for OSNs in general, we need social graph models which enable the generation of synthetic datasets. In this paper we present a generic model to synthesize social interaction graphs for both centralized OSNs like Facebook and secure and privacy-preserving P2P OSNs such as Vegas. Our approach accounts for a static component which models relationships and network effects and a dynamic component which models interactions among users. A flexible parameterization schema allows our model to individually influence certain graph characteristics like node degrees, clustering coefficients, and node interactions.},

No connection in the reduced version exists unless it was in the original network, connectivity is preserved. Reduction of as much as 80% can be observed in real networks. Just reducing the size makes comprehension of the network much easier.},

abstract = {The spread of influence in a network is a fundamental issue in many complex systems. For instance, the word of-mouth effect in a social network is crucial to the emerging viral market. The process was previously analyzed with a voter model where an individual weighs the opinions of his acquaintances equally. However, one would expect that an individual's opinion is often more swayed by her/his better connected peers. As such, the influence of a node x on another node should be proportional to x's degree. This paper studies the spread of influence under the latter model -- called Preferential Voter Model (PVM) for easier reference. We first present the exact form of the random walk stationary distribution for PVM, based on which, we show that the First Passage Time (FPT) of PVM follows an exponential decay. Furthermore, compared against the conventional (nonpreferential) voter model, we show that nodes with larger degrees exhibit faster decay rate and lower mean First Passage Time in PVM. These new results have applications to network-based complex systems. For instance, in the context of viral marketing in a social network, picking nodes of larger degrees as the starting nodes of a sales campaign not only maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes in the network, but also reduces the expected time to spread the influence. Thus, our result confirms analytically that well-connected individuals indeed exert faster and more effective influences in social networks under the preferential model.},

Besides this, friend recommendation is an important tool for recommending potential candidates as friends to users in order to enhance the development of the entire network structure. Existing friend recommendation methods utilize social network structure and/or user profile information. However, these techniques can no longer be applicable if the privacy of users is taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose a two-phase private friend recommendation protocol for recommending friends to a given target user based on the network structure as well as utilizing the real message interaction between users. Our protocol computes the recommendation scores of all users who are within a radius of h from the target user in a privacy preserving manner. In addition, we show the practical applicability of our approach through empirical analysis.},

We also analyzed changes over the previous two decades and compared the networks with earlier air transportation network studies. In our analysis, we did not observe considerable changes in the analyzed complex network features of the U.S. air transportation over the past two decade. Moreover, the U.S. air transportation network exhibits small world characteristics and has an assortative mixing by the degree similar to the earlier study on the world-wide air transportation network. However, the US air transportation network exhibits a partial power law degree distribution unlike the complete power law reported in earlier air transportation networks.},

Finally community structure of the graph reveals after reaching to the local Nash equilibrium of the game.

These interactions are performed by actors who actually share links with different communities. Thus, dividing the set of nodes into those who interact with several communities and those who only interact with their own communities, will give some insight about how the communities interact.},

This feature promotes real time collaboration, opening the door towards a social interaction among development team members. This interaction allows software developers to communicate more effectively through an internal social networking site within the context of the version control environment. The new feature demonstrates that it can be effectively utilized to avoid conflicts, which is one of the major challenges not only in version control, but in any collaborative system.},

Results show that there is a clear pattern of networks losing their disassortative character in the early years followed by disassortative networks in the later years.

Hence most service providers offer various preference-based privacy policies, allowing users to suppress any information under their accounts in case they do not wish to share it with public. In this paper, we show that such policies are not sufficient to provide privacy mainly because they do not allow users to control data belonging to other users they are linked with. We show experimentally that one can predict a suppressed boolean label (e.g, being rich or having voted for a specific political party) of a node from other released information in neighboring nodes when there is a known correlation between the links and the label.},

In order to ensure cooperative behavior, we have added a new node type to the system, called inspector and used game theoretical tools to analyze the system. Inspectors punish both misbehaving nodes as well as nodes who provide dishonest ratings about other peers. Analyzing the proposed inspection game ensures that corruption of inspectors and misbehavior of nodes is bounded. The game enables the system designer to set the amount of corruption that is allowed according to the budget.},

Our algorithms are based on three main features: a social network analysis measure (degree centrality), the graph searching algorithm (Depth First Search algorithm), and the semantic similarity measure (which measures the closeness between the input item and users). We apply these algorithms to a real dataset (Amazon dataset) and we compare them with item-based collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendation algorithms. Our results show good precision as well as in a good performance in terms of runtime. Moreover, Node-Edge-Based and Node-Based algorithms search a small part of the dataset, compared to item-based and hybrid recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of trade and traffic in our country has resulted in the increasing occurrence of various types of disasters and emergency injuries. According to the statistics from Fire Departments of Taiwan, medical emergency dispatch frequencies have exceeded 300,000, and the frequency of medical emergency dispatches has increased each year. These figures reflect the phenomenon that, despite the continual growth and progression of the community, various accidents and unforeseen situations are becoming increasingly common. Therefore, fire units have established a medical emergency care system with the objective of minimizing injuries, patient suffering, and the risk of mortality, reducing social medical costs, and alleviating the financial burden of medical emergencies on families. Many countries have special medical emergency dispatch systems, but these do not meet Taiwan's rules and emergency procedures. Thus, our research has focused on compiling a symptom-based medical emergency dispatch guide designed to match Taiwan's medical emergency dispatch system. We collate national medical emergency dispatch guides and present a medical emergency dispatch system to support medical staff and to educate these staff on the correct methodology in a short time. This system achieves the following objectives: (1) to enhance the quality of medical emergency services in Taiwan, (2) to reduce the response time of medical emergency dispatch, (3) to reduce the unnecessary waste of medical resources.},

abstract = {Online health communities enable patients to share ideas and experiences to improve their understanding of themselves and their treatment. Personalized recommendation helps patients find appropriate online social resources and protects and enhances the character of the resources. Recommendation needs to leverage a wide variety of types of interactions, but most state-of-the-art recommender systems using matrix factorization are designed for one type of relation with a restricted range of ratings. In this paper, we address the problem of recommendation using multiple relations with unrestricted ranges of ratings derived from social behaviors. We model multiple relations through multi-task matrix factorization where the latent profiles are emph{partially shared} between relations. Moreover, we offer two new techniques for transforming between the distribution produced by latent factor models and power-law-distributed ratings. The experiments conducted over a data set from a diabetes community suggest that the proposed model can improve the accuracy of recommendation in online health communities. The performance for recommendation to users is very good (mean rank of test examples is less than 5 out of 30) but poorer for recommendation to groups (mean rank 10 out of 30).},

Distributed applications are gaining popularity with the widespread of reliable communication services. It is affordable to have data accessible 24/7 from almost anywhere, thanks to the well-developed mobile technology and handheld devices. Healthcare domain is one of the very demanding application areas that highly benefits from these developments. Actually, health clinic system is an evolving and promising area in which clients can easily log into a distant health clinic server and retrieve, add, or update the data and diagnosis of the patients using Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) middleware. In this paper, we describe the development and implementation of a middleware model that utilizes the effective connection between two different programming languages (java and .Net) to send and receive requested patients' data in a very efficient response time. This is achieved by using the reference of the object in the server. Based on our knowledge, our approach has the best response time compared to the existing works in the area. Our approach has been successfully tested and evaluated.},

abstract = {Hepatitis C virus' patients with genotypes 1 &amp; 4 have break-even response rates to Pegylated-Interferon (Peg-IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) treatment. Furthermore, the incompliance to the treatment because of its high cost and related unfavorable effects makes its prediction of paramount importance. By using machine-learning techniques, a significantly accurate predictive model constructed to predict Egyptian patients' response based on their clinical and biochemical data. The model uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees (DT) to achieve this goal. Two-hundred patients treated with Peg-IFN and RBV, 83 responders (41%), and 117 non-responders (59%) retrospectively studied to extract informative features and train the Neural Networks and Decision Trees. Optimization was done by using six different Neural Network architectures, starting with an input layer of 12 neurons, a hidden layer of 70 to 180 neurons and an output layer containing a single neuron. For decision Trees (DTs), the CART classification algorithm was used. Six DTs with two classes, pruning levels of 9, 11, 13, and 17, and nodes from 45 to 61 were investigated. Among the 12 features in the study, the most statistically significant informative features were the patient's Histology activity index, fibrosis, viral-load, Alfa-feta protein and albumin. Validation of the models on a 20% test set was then performed. The best and average accuracy for the ANN and DT models were 0.76 and 0.69, and 0.80 and 0.72 respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.39, and 0.89 and 0.78 respectively. We conclude that decision trees gave a higher accuracy in predicting response, and would help in proper therapy options for patients.},

abstract = {Tumor markers are substances, usually proteins that can be found in the blood, urine, stool, tumor tissue and more recently DNA changes, which are produced by the body in response to cancer growth. Thus far, more than 20 different tumor markers have been identified where some of them are specific for a particular type of cancer, while others are associated with several cancer types. The problem of tumor profiling has been extensively studied by the bioinformatics community. Although tumor classification has improved nowadays, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes or for assigning tumors to known classes. In this paper we describe a novel strategy for tumor classification by using Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing map (GHSOM) since it is able to weigh the contribution of each marker according to its relatedness with other tumor markers as well as handles highly skewed tumor marker expressions well. In the end, experiments are conducted to further demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of tumor classification approach which provide valuable contribution in the field of oncology and cancer diseases and will be as a guide for the identification of these diseases.},

For example, time-series genomic or metabolic micro array data can be used to construct dynamic genetic regulatory network models, which can be used to better understand the biological system and to design intervention strategies to cure or manage major diseases. Unfortunately, biological measurements are usually highly contaminated with errors that mask the important features in the data. Therefore, these noisy measurements need to be filtered to enhance their usefulness in practice. Wavelet-based multiscale filtering has been shown to be a powerful data analysis and denoising tool. In this work, different batch as well as online multiscale filtering techniques are used to filter biological data contaminated with white noise. The performances of these multiscale filtering techniques are demonstrated and compared to those of some conventional low pass filters using simulated time series metabolic data. The results of this comparative study show that significant improvement can be achieved using multiscale filtering over conventional filtering methods.},

abstract = {In this study, a Central Composite Face Centered (CCF) design was employed to study the individual and interaction effects of demographic characteristics on the spread of HIV in South Africa. The demographic characteristics studied for each pregnant mother attending an antenatal clinic in South Africa, were mother's age, partner's age, mother's level of education and parity. HIV status of an antenatal clinic attendee was found to be highly sensitive to changes in pregnant woman's age and partner's age, using the 2007 South African annual antenatal HIV and syphilis seroprevalence data. Individually the pregnant woman's level of education and parity had no significant effect on the HIV status. However, the latter two demographic characteristics exhibited significant effects on the HIV status of antenatal clinic attendees in two way interactions with other demographic characteristics. Using HIV as the optimization objective, the following summary statistics were obtained, R2 = 0.99 and two-factor interactions (2FI) model F-value of 63.77. The model F-value of 63.77 implied the 2FI model was significant and there was only a 0.01% chance this model value could occur due to noise. The model 'Lack of Fit' value of 0.01 implied that the 'Lack of Fit' was not significant relative to the pure error and thus there was a 99.88% chance that this 'Lack of Fit' F-value could occur due to noise. An adeq. precision value of 25 was obtained, suggesting that this 2FI model could be used to navigate the design space. A 3D response surface plot indicated that the highest rate of HIV positive individuals was obtainable at the highest age of the pregnant women and lowest age of their partners.},

abstract = {Critical refers to infrastructure that provides an essential support for economic and social well-being, for public safety and for the functioning of key government responsibilities. According to Resolution of the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia various sources of threat are directed towards critical infrastructure. An operational infrastructure ensures the implementation of key state and society function. In this respect, the treat to critical infrastructure may also influence the national security. Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that will have an impact on the achievement of objectives. When we discuses risks, we usually talk about negative impacts, which can cause that we can't be able to achieve our objectives. Risk management is an act or process of controlling risks. All of the government programmes studied adopt a risk management approach to critical infrastructure protection. Risk management helps governments to identify key security assets, assess risks and establishes strategies and priorities for mitigating these risks. We can almost never eliminate the risks completely. Risks can be reduced to an acceptable level. The acceptable risk is a set of risks that the process is facing is sufficiently small or unimportant for the critical infrastructure to coexist with it and not try to further reduce it. Management or those who are responsible for critical infrastructure will want to reduce risk to an acceptable level by applying controls and other measures.},

abstract = {It has been known for some time that in terror networks, money laundering networks, and criminal networks, "important" players want to stay "off" the radar. They need sufficient centrality (according to traditional measures) to be well connected with the rest of their network, but need to blend in with the crowd. In this paper, we propose the concept of covertness centrality (CC). The covertness centrality of a vertex $v$ consists of two parts: how "common" $v$ is w.r.t. a set $mathcal{C}$ of centrality measures, and how well $v$ can "communicate" with a user-specified set of vertices. The more "common" $v$ is, the more able it is to stay hidden in a crowd. Given $mathcal{C}$, we first propose some general properties we would like a common-ness measure to satisfy. We then develop a probabilistic model of common-ness that a vertex has w.r.t. $mathcal{C}$ (specifying, intuitively, how many other vertices are like it according to all centrality measures in $mathcal{C}$). Covertness centrality of vertex $v$ is then defined as a linear combination of common-ness and the ability of $v$ to communicate with a user-specified set of other vertices. We develop a prototype implementation of CC and report on experiments we have conducted with it on several real-world data sets.},

The human brain has great capabilities of developing invariant representations of objects by taking advantage of both spatial similarity of features of objects/events and their relative timings (temporal information). Trace learning rule is one well-known solution for this problem of combining temporal relations with spatial proximity in clustering tasks such as the one performed by self organizing maps. In this work, we investigate a two stage mechanism: i) finding local clusters using spatial proximity, ii) grouping these clusters as suggested by temporal continuity patterns. We show our experimental results on a movie created from face images.},

abstract = {While the focus of trust research has been mainly on defining and modeling various notions of social trust, less attention has been given to modeling opinion trust. When speaking of social trust mainly homophily (similarity) has been the most successful metric for learning trustworthy links, specially in social web applications such as collaborative filtering recommendation systems. While pure homophily such as Pearson coefficient correlation and its variations, have been favorable to finding taste distances between individuals based on their rated items, they are not necessarily useful in finding opinion distances between individuals discussing a trending topic, e.g. Arab spring. At the same time text mining techniques, such as vector-based techniques, are not capable of capturing important factors such as saliency or polarity which are possible with topical models for detecting, analyzing and suggesting aspects of people mentioning those tags or topics. Thus, in this paper we are proposing to model opinion distances using probabilistic information divergence as a metric for measuring the distances between people's opinion contributing to a discussion in a social network. To acquire feature sets from topics discussed in a discussion we use a very successful topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use the distributions resulting to model topics for generating social networks of group and individual users. Using a Twitter dataset we show that learned graphs exhibit properties of real-world like networks.},

We do this by examining the language used by the U.S. presidential candidates in the high-stakes attempt to get elected. Such candidates try to influence potential voters, but must also pay attention to the parallel attempts by their competitors to influence the same pool. We examine seven channels: persona deception, the attempt by each candidate to seem as attractive as possible, nouns, as surrogates for content; positive and negative language; and three categories that have received little attention, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Although the results are preliminary, several intuitive and expected hypotheses are supported, but some unexpected and surprising structures also emerge. The results provide insights into related influence scenarios where open-source data is available, for example marketing, business reporting, and intelligence.},

abstract = {Smart mobile phones are, nowadays, in wide use and day by day they are transformed into an essential part of everyday life, for business and for entertainment alike. Mobile Networks have been implemented in order to serve these needs. Unfortunately there are many users who want to use the benefits that technology gives to them for malicious and/or illegal actions. In this paper we present and analyze a hypothetical (but realistic) cyber crime investigation scenario. According to this, a user who has wireless internet access using a mobile phone through a University's network facilities, visits sites with pornographic content. A fact that complicates the analysis of the scenario is that the user employs anti-forensics techniques (e.g. data encryption). In this paper we show how to apply to the investigation of this scenario (as well as similar ones) a number of widely available open source forensics analysis tools overcoming the anti-forensics efforts of malicious users. Our goal is to demonstrate their applicability to cyber-crime forensics and their capability to operate in a complementary, to each other, way so that their deployment sheds light to different aspects of the case at hand.},

abstract = {It is often essential for people to consult with others and ask them about their past experience and thoughts when making choices. Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social book marking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social book marking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data.},

However, there is no detailed investigation on how accurately Web-mined data reflect real-world data. It must be problematic to idolatrously utilize the Web-mined data in public Web applications without ensuring their accuracy sufficiently. Therefore, this paper defines spatio-temporal Web Sensors by analyzing Twitter, Facebook, web logs, news sites, or the whole Web for a target natural phenomenon, and tries to validate the potential and reliability of the Web Sensors' spatio-temporal data by measuring the coefficient correlation with Japanese weather, earthquake, and influenza statistics per week by region as real-world data.},

abstract = {Study of the dynamics of longitudinal networks has already attracted enormous research interest. Although dynamics of networks can be captured both at network-level and node / actor-level, the latter has gained less attention in current literature. By following a topological approach (i.e., static topology and dynamic topology) to analyze networks, this paper first proposes a research framework to capture actor-level dynamics for longitudinal networks. In static topology, Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods are applied on the aggregated network of entire data collection period. A smaller segment of network data that are accumulated in less time compared to the entire data collection period are used in dynamic typology for analysis purpose. This study further successfully compiles and applies this framework to the context of organizational crisis and project dynamics with the purpose to explore different level of actor-level dynamics at the different operational environment of these contexts over time. It is noticed that different level of actor-level dynamics are observed in the communication and collaboration network during the different facets of the organizations. In the context of organizational crisis, it is evident that during the 'crisis' period of operational running of organization, actors in the organizational email communication networks show higher level of actor-level dynamics compared to the 'normal' period. Less actor-level dynamics are observed during the 'final' phase of project life cycle, as found from the second context.},

With the popularity of microblogging services, the huge volume of very short texts makes it difficult to track the latest updates or breaking news. In this paper, we propose a novel social influence model for estimating the popularity score for each short text in plurk. First, the degrees of user participation and user propagation are estimated by the number of replies, replurks, likes, and URIs. Then, we measure the influence persistence by the duration of the initial post and the last response, and the influence score can be derived from a linear combination of these simple statistics. Our experimental results on more than 300 thousand plurks collected from 1,750 users showed a good performance in determining popular messages, with the best F-measure of 0.86. From our case studies, top-ranked messages can accurately reflect the popular discussions on important events. This shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Further investigation of applying the influence model in event detection is needed.},

abstract = {We introduce our initial work for developing a social networks recommender system called T-Recs. The system is a time-aware Twitter-based alternative medicine recommender system. We collected a set of tweets (around 500,000 tweets) that contain specific hash tags (#throwing up, #headache, #itching etc) for a three consecutive weeks. The individual tweets were examined manually by a domain expert (a medical doctor) who inspected the tweet sentiments along with the tweet's timestamp. Using this data, the domain expert assigned a preliminary label to the tweet/group of tweets. We then trained a classifier using the hash tags and its labels taking into consideration other factors (i.e., age, gender, co-morbidity conditions) that the Tweeter must provide by taking a questionnaire. After the questions are answered, the recommender system makes recommendations based on the Tweet contents and the questionnaire factors for never-seen-before tweets. The classifier, is the core component of the recommender system, is designed as a Decision Tree algorithm to classify the Tweets. Each recommendation is made by the system provides a medical advice to promote public health awareness, and a link to the recommender systems' web portal to answer the questionnaire. When the questionnaire is submitted, the symptoms and Tweeter's basic information are consolidated and a recommendation is made available to the user at once. For the sake of feasibility, we only considered tweets that are sent from within the United States.},

Particularly important is the possibility to create complex metadata descriptions for any problem domain, based on pre-defined ontologies. In this paper we evaluate the use of a semantic similarity measure based on pre-defined ontologies as an input for a classification analysis in the context of social network analysis. A link prediction between actors of two real world social networks is performed, which could serve as a recommendation system. The social networks involve different types of relations and nodes. We measure the prediction performance based on a semantic similarity measure as well as traditional approaches. The findings demonstrate that the prediction accuracy based on the semantic similarity is comparable to traditional approaches and shows that data mining on complex social networks using ontology-based metadata can be considered as a very promising approach.},

Conversely, strong ties are the people we really trust, people whose social circles tightly overlap with our own and, often, they are also the people most like us. Unfortunately, the majority of social media do not incorporate explicitly tie strength information in the creation and management of relationships, and treat all users the same: friend or stranger, with little or nothing in between. In the current work, we address the challenging issue of detecting on online social networks the strong and intimate ties from the huge mass of such mere social contacts. In order to do so, we propose a novel multidimensional definition of tie strength which exploits the existence of multiple online social links between two individuals. We test our definition on a multidimensional network constructed over users in Foursquare, Twitter and Facebook, analyzing the structural role of strong and weak links, and the correlations with the most common similarity measures.},

abstract = {We calculate the cyclic entropy of a real virtual friendship network to have an insight on the degree of its robustness. Upon counting the number of cycles of different sizes in the network, a probability distribution function is resulted. An actual friendship network is found to have cyclic entropy bounded between random and small-world networks models. It has dual properties. Small world networks indicate the existence of critical network sizes: 150 and 700 at which the cyclic entropy is minimum. Scale-free networks have the highest cyclic entropy among all other complex network models regardless of the size of the network.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity and usage of online social media services, people now have accounts (some times several) on multiple and diverse services like Facebook, Linked In, Twitter and You Tube. Publicly available information can be used to create a digital footprint of any user using these social media services. Generating such digital footprints can be very useful for personalization, profile management, detecting malicious behavior of users. A very important application of analyzing users' online digital footprints is to protect users from potential privacy and security risks arising from the huge publicly available user information. We extracted information about user identities on different social networks through Social Graph API, Friend Feed, and Profilactic, we collated our own dataset to create the digital footprints of the users. We used username, display name, description, location, profile image, and number of connections to generate the digital footprints of the user. We applied context specific techniques (e.g. Jaro Winkler similarity, Word net based ontologies) to measure the similarity of the user profiles on different social networks. We specifically focused on Twitter and Linked In. In this paper, we present the analysis and results from applying automated classifiers for disambiguating profiles belonging to the same user from different social networks. User ID and Name were found to be the most discriminative features for disambiguating user profiles. Using the most promising set of features and similarity metrics, we achieved accuracy, precision and recall of 98%, 99%, and 96%, respectively.},

abstract = {On-line Social Networks (OSNs) are increasingly influencing the way people communicate with each other and share personal, professional and political information. Like the cyberspace in Internet, the OSNs are attracting the interest of the malicious entities that are trying to exploit the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the OSNs. Increasing reports of the security and privacy threats in the OSNs is attracting security researchers trying to detect and mitigate threats to individual users. With many OSNs having tens or hundreds of million users collectively generating billions of personal data content that can be exploited, detecting and preventing attacks on individual user privacy is a major challenge. Most of the current research has focused on protecting the privacy of an existing online profile in a given OSN. Instead, we note that there is a risk of not having a profile in the last fancy social network! The risk is due to the fact that an adversary may create a fake profile to impersonate a real person on the OSN. The fake profile could be exploited to build online relationship with the friends of victim of identity theft, with the final target of stealing personal information of the victim, via interacting online with the friends of the victim. In this paper, we report on the investigation we did on a possible approach to mitigate this problem. In doing so, we also note that we are the first ones to analyze social network graphs from a dynamic point of view within the context of privacy threats.},

In this work we present a visualization approach that uses coloring, sizing and filtering to help the users perceive the communicated information. The result of sensitivity analyses is integrated into the visualization using the change amount caused by the actors as information. The main contribution of this study is a visualization where the information communicated from a social network is enhanced by the help of sensitivity analyses.},

Specifically, it seeks to address two research questions: (1) what relationship exists between the number of director interlocks and companies' profitability? (2) what relationship exists between power within the network of interlocking directorates and companies' profitability? The dataset was drawn from 2010 Fortune 500 companies. Regression models were developed to address the two research questions. To mitigate the effects of confounding factors, three control variables, namely, size, age and sector of the companies were used. Results suggest that both interlocks and power asserted a positive linear relationship with companies' profitability. However, the control variables did not seem to influence these relationships. Moreover, prediction of companies' profitability was found to be a complex undertaking. In conclusion, this paper acknowledges a few limitations and offers suggestions for future research.},

As time goes by, the links between people will form the so-called §Strong Links . For those users, information provided by the friends with strong link is considered as more interesting and useful. Most of recent search engines are designed based on only measuring the similarity between keywords and articles. However, the social relations between authors of articles and searcher have not been taken into account in recent research. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of recent search engines, we include the measurement of social relationships in search engine and expect the search quality can be improved. In this study, we collected the data from Facebook to calculate the social relationship. About the content, the data will be processed by using CKIP (Chinese word net) and TF-IDF. Finally, we combine key-word frequency and social relations as a value, which is called the Social Ranking vaule. The value will be used as the key to rank the search results. In this paper, we will also demonstrate a real example to explain the proposed methodology as well as a system interface.},

abstract = {Retrieval and management of Web data is becoming a more and more complex problem, due to the amount of information to be dealt with, to the diversity of the information sources and of the data formats, and to the evolving expectations of users. In particular, some tasks such as quality assessment, opinion making, and sense extraction cannot be completely delegated to automatic procedures. More and more users are increasingly relying on social interaction to complete and validate the results of their online activities. For instance, scouting "interesting" results, or suggesting new, unexpected search directions in information seeking processes occurs in most times aside of the search systems and processes, possibly instrumented and mediated by a social network. In this paper we propose paradigm that embodies crowds and social network communities as first-class sources for the information management and extraction on the Web. Our approach aims at filling the gap between traditional Web systems (CMS, search engines and others), which operate upon world-wide information, with social systems, capable of interacting with real people, in real time, to capture their opinions, suggestions, and emotions by leveraging crowd sourcing practices and making them viable upon a social network. This enormously enriches the data manipulation experience for the user can be enormously enriched.},

It is beneficial to detect conversation threads contained in the email corpora for various applications, including discussion search, expert finding and even email clustering and classification. Conversation thread in email corpora can be defined as a cluster of exchanged emails among the same group of people by reply or forwarding on the same topic. According to this definition, we can define parent-child relation between emails, so email conversation threads seem to demonstrate tree structure. This paper presents a new approach based on genetic programming for reconstruction of conversation threads in emails data. This approach considers finding email conversation threads as an optimization problem, and exploits genetic programming to search intelligently in the space of possible solutions. Rather than several studies that have been conducted on this problem, this work concentrates on detecting accurate structure of conversation threads in high recall. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation on the BC3 data set. Preliminary results suggest that our method provides acceptable precision and higher recall than existing methods.},

abstract = {Today's social networks are getting larger, and the need to analyze datasets with millions of nodes and billions of edges is not uncommon any more. As a network of social relationships evolves by the addition of new nodes and edges, fast algorithms are desirable for the recomputation of key network measures such as actor centrality. The distributed computing paradigm offers a scalable approach to addressing the recomputation challenge. This paper develops a Map-Reduce implementation of an incremental All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) algorithm. The incremental nature of the approach allows for performing minimal work in updating centrality measures, while the Map-Reduce implementation makes it scalable to large data. The key idea of the incremental APSP algorithm [1] is based on the efficient use of past information about the shortest paths between any node and the neighbors of the newly added node. A presented parallelized version of the algorithm relies on a three-step iterative execution of the "map" and "reduce" jobs. Experiences with its implementation are reported in application to a real-world dataset containing 7115 nodes. The experimental runs were performed using the Amazon's EMR service.},

Therefore, the analysis of the characteristics of density-based clustering methods in application to community identification is important and valuable. The article presents and evaluates new similarity measures that can be utilised by the approaches to density-based community identification. Several experiments on real life and generated networks are performed to show and explain the differences between these measures and to compare them with other methods. The results show that the new measures improve the quality of analysis and that density-based clustering algorithms can be valuable community identification methods.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a scheme of detecting gIntensive Bookmarking using Multiple Accounts h (IBMA), where many social bookmark accounts are used to create bookmark entries linking to the target web resources with the aim of increasing site visitors or optimizing search result ranking. To efficiently detect IBMA, we propose to use clustering social bookmark user accounts according to the similarity with respect to the book marked web resources or web sites. Specifically, we cluster users who create bookmarks linking to similar set of web resources or web sites. For this, we propose three similarity measurements over two sets of bookmarks. We experimentally show that the proposed scheme successfully detects IBMA spammers in a real dataset. We also evaluate the accuracy of the proposed scheme with varying the similarity measurements, and characterize them.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been strongly researched within the last decade. With the arising and popularization of digital social networks a new field has been opened for social recommendations. Considering the network topology, users interactions, or estimating trust between users are some of the new strategies that recommender systems can take into account in order to adapt their techniques to these new scenarios. We introduce MarkovTrust, a way to infer trust from Twitter interactions and to compute trust between distant users. MarkovTrust is based on Markov chains, which makes it simple to be implemented and computationally efficient. We study the properties of this trust metric and study its application in a recommender system of tweets.},

abstract = {Currently, the detection of global community structure in networks has gathered a lot of attention. Most of the methods need global knowledge of the graphs which would be unrealistic to get when the graphs are too large or evolve too quickly. Moreover, sometimes we are only interested in the community structures of some given nodes, not all nodes. So detecting the community of a given node i.e. local community detection is more appropriate. Most of the proposed solutions for local community detection built upon the source nodes are sensitive to the position of source nodes. In this paper, we propose a method to detect local community of a given node by finding the core node of the community firstly. Then expand the core node's cliques to get community of the given node. We validate our method on real-world networks whose community structures are available. The result shows that our method can get high recall and precision score and is quite effective and flexible to identify local communities, irrespective of the source node position.},

We conducted a survey in Japan, using a mock Thai website that showed three different levels of SNS information. We found that consumers who are SNS members have a more positive attitude towards the website when SNS-based feedback information is shown. We also found that the nationality of the SNS members giving the feedback affects trust and risk perceptions differently.},

abstract = {The use of social networking sites, such as Twitter, for various purposes, continues to grown since its first appearance. This social net is a microblogging site to share short messages on a variety of topics. In particular, political elections are a very interesting field to exchange views using this platform. In this paper we have used Spanish elections to investigate the use of Twitter for this purpose, and to find out if the conversations maintained there can anticipate, in some way, the results of the elections. In order to do this, we have developed a tool, called Tara tweet, to define experiments and to capture the defined conversations, and have applied it to the cases of three Spanish elections during 2011 and 2012. Our results show that Twitter is used for political discussion, and that the references to the different political parties correlate, significatively, with the votes of the electors. This is an indicator that Twitter may be used by social researchers as a tool, among others, to predict future results of the elections. Of course, with due caution because the measured data correspond to distinct actions, so obviously, much more research and studies should be done in this field.},

Not only RWP and ER are useful in evaluating networking protocols in a simulation environment, but they are also used for theoretical analysis of such dynamic networks. However, it has been observed that neither relationships among people nor their movements are random. Instead, human movements frequently contain repeated patterns and friendship is bounded by distance. We used social networking site Go Walla to collect, create and validate models of human mobility and relationships for analysis and evaluations of applications in opportunistic networks such as sensor networks and transportation models in civil engineering. In doing so, we hope to provide more human-like movements and social relationship models to researchers to study problems in complex and mobile networks.},

In this paper we examine knowledge generation under informal social communications, based on semantically enriched user-generated data and associated metadata. We dynamically capture users' interests and expertise using such semantically enriched content. Knowledge networks of users emerge, exhibiting collective intelligence. To capture such collective knowledge, we propose a novel knowledge base paradigm, which seamlessly integrates information from multiple platforms and facilitates knowledge extraction, mining, discovery and inferencing. Using semantically enriched user profiles, we compute semantic similarity between users and content in a joint semantic space, driving numerous applications.},

In general, a community can be thought of as a portion of a graph in which intra-community links are dense while inter-community links are sparse. Automatic community structure detection has been well studied in static graphs. However, many practical applications of community structure involve networks in which communities change dynamically over time. Several methods of detecting the community structure of dynamic graphs have been proposed, however most treat the dynamic graph as a series of static snapshots, which creates unrealistic assumptions. Others require large amounts of computational resources or require knowledge of the dynamic graph from start to finish, relegating them to post-processing. For those who desire real-time community structure detection distributed over the observing network, these solutions are insufficient. This paper proposes a new method of community structure detection which allows for real time distributed detection of community structure.},

Network of legal authorities of formal institutions related to water resources in national level was delineated with "Network Analysis" through UCINET and Net draw Software's. The data have been analyzed using the different indices in network analysis such as centrality, degree, power, and cut point. The results show that there is no good power distribution among water section institutions and no firm relationship among administrative and authoritative institutions in this section. Moreover, nongovernmental institutions do not profit from an appropriate position in these documents. So, it is necessary for policy makers to pay more attention to a balanced power distribution among institutions in national and provincial levels.},

The authors study behavioral motifs that are possible to observe at the dyadic level. The study shows significant differences between dyads that are more vs less engaged in the diffusion process. Dyads that fuel the diffusion proccess are characterized by stronger relationships (higher activity, more common friends), more active and networked receiving party (higher centrality measures), and higher authority centrality of person sending a viral message.},

Outlet performs customer segmentation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) score after which a Recursive Cluster Elimination is performed that eliminates customers within the targeted segment. Recursive Frequent Item set Mining and Recursive Market Basket Analysis are performed for the rest of customers in the targeted segment. From the obtained results, the product preferences of the remaining customers in the segment are identified based on which offers are formulated and recommended for the entire segment. It is then communicated to the MMO that intimates these offers to the potential customers among the segment. This model results in boosting customer purchases, expanding customer base and effects in the profitability of the combined source.},

abstract = {Studying the text messages of a user such as his posts in Facebook or his tweets in Twitter can help in detecting his topics of interests. User in Social Network Systems (SNS) posts text messages about a wide diverse of topics. Posts usually written in a non-standard language, which make it not applicable to the standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques used to catch the relations between words in text. In many cases there are semantic relations between the contained entities of posts that can infer the interest of the user. Bag-Of-Words (BOW) based text classification techniques classify this kind of messages to a wide diverse of topics, but they fail in catching the implicit semantic relation between the contained entities. In this paper we propose a technique to discover the implicit semantic relations between entities in text messages, which can infer the interests of a user. The proposed technique based on a semantically enriched graph representation of entities contained in text messages generated by a user, a new algorithm (Root-Path-Degree) is invented and used to find the most representative sub-graph that reflects the semantic implicit interests of the user. An evaluation was done using manually annotated posts of 687 Facebook users. Precision and Recall results showed our technique performs better than the standard BOW technique.},

abstract = {Trust-ware recommender systems provide the features of personalized product and service recommendations in web based social networks by using the trust connections existing between users and preferences data available for each user. One of the main sources of user preferences data are the tags that users apply to different items. Encouraging users to apply more tags is one of the challenges faced by most social network sites. In this paper we purpose an approach to identify influential taggers in a trust based social network so that efforts to encourage tagging can be achieved by designing incentives for motivating the influential taggers to apply more tags. In our proposed approach, for every user his tagging influencer is that user in his personal network who has influenced his tagging behavior the most. We define an active user tagging actions has been influenced by a user in his personal network only when the active user tags an item after his influencer has tagged it. The influential taggers in the overall social network are those who have the influenced the maximum number of users in the network. We analyze the real life dataset of Last.fm to show that our approach is different from the current approach of defining those users who have tagged the maximum number of items as the influential users. We also discuss the implications of using our approach.},

abstract = {Multi agent systems with autonomous interaction, negotiation and learning capabilities can efficiently model social behavior of individuals participating in a social network. A central problem in a social network is to identify the nodes that actively participate in the expansion of the net both physically and functionally. Several metrics have already been proposed to identify those hot spots. The algorithms to identify hot spots are either heuristic based or computationally expensive. In this paper we use an agent model of the social net and propose a method that can identify the neutral nodes, i.e. the nodes that can never be considered as hot spot nodes given the network topology and rules of negotiation among nodes. Therefore these nodes can be eliminated from the net. A direct advantage of this method is reducing the computational complexity for the configuration and identification of hot spots. Through a case study we have shown that the proposed method can lead to 33% reduction of computation regarding the number of agent types in the example.},

abstract = {The current paper is an investigation towards understanding the navigational performance of humans on a network when the 'landmark' nodes are blocked. We observe that humans learn to cope up, despite the continued introduction of blockages in the network. The experiment proposed involves the task of navigating on a word network based on a puzzle called the word morph. We introduce blockages in the network and report an incremental improvement in performance with respect to time. We explain this phenomenon by analyzing the evolution of the knowledge in the human participants of the underlying network as more and more landmarks are removed. We hypothesize that humans learn the bare essentials to navigate unless we introduce blockages in the network which would whence enforce upon them the need to explore newer ways of navigating. We draw a parallel to human problem solving and postulate that obstacles are catalysts for humans to innovate techniques to solve a restricted variant of a familiar problem.},

abstract = {A fully connected network of multiple interacting agents modeled as a cooperative game to attain a common objective has found wide applications in the real world. Competitors frequently come together to work in coalitions that are mutually beneficial to them all, though the allocation of the mutual gains achieved is seldom easy. Shapley value is a popular way to compute payoffs in cooperative games where the agents are assumed to have deterministic, risk-neutral (linear) utilities. This paper explores a class of Multi-agent constant-sum cooperative games where the payoffs are random variables. We introduce a new model based on Borch's Theorem from the actuarial world of re-insurance, to obtain a Pareto optimal allocation for agents with risk-averse exponential utilities. This allocation problem seeks to maximize a linear sum of the expected utilities of a set of agents and the solution obtained at this optimal value naturally maximizes the social welfare of the grand coalition. The four main axioms of the Shapely Value, namely, nullity, additivity, symmetry and efficiency are satisfied by this solution. We show the correspondence of our solution to the Shapley value. As a result we can directly obtain the Shapley value from the allocation values obtained at the Pareto optimum as the individual utility achievements of the grand coalition.},

abstract = {The paper performs an empirical study of the My Space Online Social Network (OSN). It aims to capture the evolution of user population, to examine user activity, and finally to characterize community formation using two well established community finding algorithms, namely the Fortuna to et al. and the Clique Percolation algorithms. Both algorithms are known to be effective in identifying communities in large graphs, starting at seed nodes and utilizing only local interactions between nodes. One million user profiles were randomly collected in a month's period. For each profile certain attributes were fetched: profile status (public, private, invalid), member since and last login dates, number of friends, number of views, etc. The profiles and their attributes were analyzed in order to reveal the evolution in user population and the activity of the participating members. Significant conclusions were drawn for the synthesis of the population based on profile status, the number of friends, and the duration My Space members stay active. Subsequently, a large number of communities were identified aiming to reveal the structure of the underlying social network graph. The collected data were further analyzed in order to characterize community size and density but also to retrieve correlations in the activity among members of the same community. A total of 171 communities were detected with Fortunato's algorithm, while using Clique Percolation this number was 201. Results demonstrate that My Space members tend to form dense communities. For the first time, strong correlation in the last login date (the main attribute that shows user activity) for members of the same community was documented. It was also shown that members participating in the same community have similar values for other attributes like for example number of friends. Lastly, there is strong evidence that participation of users in communities inhibits them from abandoning My Space.},

The common processes of 'loads' generated by dissident activities and the core features of state resilience and its 'capacity' to withstand these 'loads' have been explored in the traditional "real world" view. More recently, however, there has been increased attention to the "cyber world" -- the role of cyber technologies in coordinating and amplifying dissident messages, as well as in aiding regimes in suppressing anti-regime dissidents. As of yet, these two views (real and cyber) have not been integrated into a common framework that seeks to explain overall changes in regime stability over time. Further, emerging uses of social media technologies, such as Twitter have not fully been examined within an overall framework of state stability that represents the nature and dynamics of 'loads' generated by dissident activities in the real (i.e. protests) and cyber (i.e. planning and coordination via cyber venues) domains.},

abstract = {We model the persuasive effect of external information sources such as media on social networks using a new endogenous social learning framework. The agents are thought to hold uninformative probabilistic prior beliefs about an issue that concerns them and learn about this state of the world through a non-Bayesian myopic DeGroot-style update process applied on the priors using social influence 'mixtures'. We model external information sources in this framework as entities that can bring to the attention of agents 'global' beliefs that are potentially from beyond the confines of a community, and may well be in conflict among themselves. In our model agents score these information sources on the basis of how closely the beliefs propounded by the sources match their own beliefs, but determine how to assimilate such beliefs on the basis of the views of their community of connected neighbors. This form of social learning of external information allows local social influences to carry shared views resulting in the potential emergence of modified homophyllic structures, for example to capture the notion that those who view external information sources in a similar manner might be inclined to demonstrate higher affinities among themselves. We show that this form of social learning of externally expounded beliefs has a learnable dynamic which achieves convergence, and can mirror scenarios where external sources can bring about consensus among opposed cliques, or break emerging consensus. We illustrate the working of the learning model on a simple example.},

In general, caching and prefetching techniques are used to reduce the delay experienced by the user while waiting to get the web page from the remote web server. The present paper attempts to solve the problem of predicting the next page to be accessed by the user based on the mining of web server logs that maintains the information of users who access the web site. The prediction of next page to be visited by the user may be pre fetched by the browser which in turn reduces the latency for user. Thus analyzing user's past behavior to predict the future web pages to be navigated by the user is of great importance.
