There are growing needs to get useful information from Twitter, because an enormous amount of information is transmitted in real time. Twitter users, who play an important role as information sources, typically transmit information about some particular topics which they are interested in. Therefore, to identify useful information, it is very important to know which topics a user tends to transmit. In this paper, we propose a method to discover appropriate topics for a user by using Twitter list. Twitter list is an official functionality to make a"user list, " list members tend to transmit information about the topic represented in the name of the list. From this observation, our idea is to extract tags from list names, and exploit the relationship among lists, tags extracted from the list names, and list members. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Social and communication networks across the world generate vast amounts of graph-like data each day. The modeling and prediction of how these communication structures evolve can be highly useful for many applications. Previous research in this area has focused largely on using past graph structure to predict future links. However, a useful observation is that many graph datasets have additional information associated with them beyond just their graph structure. In particular, communication graphs (such as email, twitter, blog graphs, etc.) have information content associated with their graph edges. In this paper we examine the link between information content and graph structure, proposing a new graph modeling approach, GC-Model, which combines both. We then apply this model to multiple real world communication graphs, demonstrating that the built models can be used effectively to predict future graph structure and information flow. On average, GC-Model's top predictions covered 19% more of the actual future graph communication structure when compared to other previously introduced algorithms, far outperforming multiple link prediction methods and several naive approaches.},

The main research question has been, `what do people talk about?' focusing on topic extraction and topic modeling. While content is clearly critical for many real-world applications, we have largely ignored identifying `how' people communicate. Conversation structure and communication patterns provide deep insight into how conversations evolve, and how the content is shared. Motivated by theoretical work from psychology and linguistics in the area of conversation alignment, we introduce SCENE, an evolution network approach to extract knowledge from a conversation network. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by taking the task of matching conversation partners. We find that SCENE is more successful because, in contrast to existing approaches, SCENE treats a conversation as an evolving, rather than a static document, and focuses on the structural elements of the conversation instead of being tied to the specific content.},

In this paper, we explore this problem from a perspective of community structure. We first find that through maximizing sample conductance, we can get high coverage sample. Based on this result, then, we propose a new decentralized search strategy named Conductance Search which tries to efficiently find the nodes belonging to different communities. We compare the strategy with other common strategies. And the results show that the conductance search outperforms others in number of steps to find the target and time complexity. Finally, we find some previous conclusions fail in many real-world networks and discuss network search-ability from the perspective of various structural properties.},

The representation and visualization of bibliographic databases as graphs and the application of data mining techniques can help us uncover interesting knowledge concerning potential synergies between researchers, possible matchings between researchers and venues, or even the ideal venue for presenting a research work. In this paper, we propose a novel representation model for bibliographic data, which combines co-authorship and content similarity information, and allows for the formation of scientific networks. Using a graph visualization tool from the biological domain, we are able to provide comprehensive visualizations that help us uncover hidden relations between authors and suggest potential synergies between researchers or groups.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of evolutionary clustering of multi-typed objects in a heterogeneous bibliographic network. The traditional methods of homogeneous clustering methods do not result in a good typed-clustering. The design of heterogeneous methods for clustering can help us better understand the evolution of each of the types apart from the evolution of the network as a whole. In fact, the problem of clustering and evolution diagnosis are closely related because of the ability of the clustering process to summarize the network and provide insights into the changes in the objects over time. We present such a tightly integrated method for clustering and evolution diagnosis of heterogeneous bibliographic information networks. We present an algorithm, ENetClus, which performs such an agglomerative evolutionary clustering which is able to show variations in the clusters over time with a temporal smoothness approach. Previous work on clustering networks is either based on homogeneous graphs with evolution, or it does not account for evolution in the process of clustering heterogeneous networks. This paper provides the first framework for evolution-sensitive clustering and diagnosis of heterogeneous information networks. The ENetClus algorithm generates consistent typed clusterings across time, which can be used for further evolution diagnosis and insights. The framework of the algorithm is specifically designed in order to facilitate insights about the evolution process. We use this technique in order to provide novel insights about bibliographic information networks.},

To discover multi-scale overlapping communities quickly, we propose a highly efficient multi-resolution link community detection algorithm to detect the link communities in massive networks based on the idea of edge labeling. First, we will get the node partition of the network based on a new multi-resolution node detection algorithm. After that, we can find the link community in a linear time by the labels of nodes. Its time complexity is near linear and its space complexity is linear. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by extensive experiments on lots of computer generated artificial graphs and real-world networks. The results show that our algorithm is very fast and highly reliable. Tests on real and artificial networks also give excellent results comparing with the newly proposed link partition algorithm.},

abstract = {The ability to discover community structures from explorative networks is useful for many applications. Most of the existing methods with regard to community mining are specifically designed for assortative networks, and some of them could be applied to address disassortative networks by means of intentionally modifying the objectives to be optimized. However, the types of the explorative networks are unknown beforehand. Consequently, it is difficult to determine what specific algorithms should be used to mine appropriate structures from exploratory networks. To address this issue, a novel concept, generalized community structure, has been proposed with the attempt to unify the two distinct counterparts in both types of networks. Furthermore, based on the proposed random network ensemble model, a generalized community mining algorithm, so called G-NCMA, has been proposed, which is promisingly suitable for both types of networks. Its performance has been rigorously tested, validated and compared with other related algorithms against real-world networks as well as synthetic networks. Experimental results show the G-NCMA algorithm is able to detect communities, without any prior, from explorative networks with a good accuracy.},

Many popular community-finding algorithms partition the entire graph into non-overlapping communities. We show that on a wide range of empirical networks, from different domains, significant numbers of cliques are split across separate partitions, as produced by such algorithms. We examine the largest connected component of the sub graph formed by retaining only edges in cliques, and apply partitioning strategies that explicitly minimise the number of cliques split. We conclude that, due to the connectedness of many networks, any community finding algorithm that produces partitions must fail to find at least some significant structures. Moreover, contrary to traditional intuition, in some empirical networks, strong ties and cliques frequently do cross community boundaries.},

abstract = {The problem of predicting links or interactions between objects in a network, is an important task in network analysis. Along this line, link prediction between co-authors in a co-author network is a frequently studied problem. In most of these studies, authors are considered in a homogeneous network, i.e., only one type of objects(author type) and one type of links (co-authorship) exist in the network. However, in a real bibliographic network, there are multiple types of objects (e.g., venues, topics, papers) and multiple types of links among these objects. In this paper, we study the problem of co-author relationship prediction in the heterogeneous bibliographic network, and a new methodology calledemph{Path Predict}, i.e., meta path-based relationship prediction model, is proposed to solve this problem. First, meta path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-author relationships. We present experiments on a real bibliographic network, the DBLP network, which show that metapath-based heterogeneous topological features can generate more accurate prediction results as compared to homogeneous topological features. In addition, the level of significance of each topological feature can be learned from the model, which is helpful in understanding the mechanism behind the relationship building.},

abstract = {In this paper we extend the formulation of the User Rating Profile model, providing a Gibbs Sampling derivation for parameter estimation. Validation tests on Movielens data show that the proposed approach outperforms significantly the variational version in terms of both prediction accuracy and learning time. Gibbs Sampling provides a simple and flexible learning procedure which can be extended to include external evidence, in the form of soft constraints. More specifically, given a-priori information about user-neighbors, we propose an effective regularization technique that drives the first sampling iterations pushing the model towards a state which better represents the user-neighborhoods specified in input.},

abstract = {The task of recommending items, like movies, to users is a core feature of many social networks. Standard approaches either use item or user similarity to suggest the next items users might be interested in. Recently, multivariate models like matrix factorization have become popular to combine the advantages of both perspectives. In addition, extensions have been proposed to capture the dynamics of user interests over time, like trends or recurrent user needs. While offering good predictive performance, so far those models do not exploit possibly available rich semantic context. Typically, only one implicit feature, like user ratings, is tracked to give personalized recommendations. However, with semantic data sources, like linked data, wealthy background knowledge becomes available that could be leveraged to improve predictive performance. We argue, that a more flexible framework is needed to model and learn a greater class of recommendation scenarios where rich context is available. Thus, we propose a generic approach which generalizes state-of-the-art methods based on pair wise interaction tensor factorization by leveraging arbitrary background knowledge related to the recommendation situation. Our experiments on streamed semantic data from a social network show that by adding varying sets of context - like user information, sequential information or time information - the ranking of potential items can be personalized and the predictive performance can be improved.},

abstract = {The main focus of this study is the computational evaluation of candidacy for an executive vacancy. We identified a new problem framework on bureaucratic promotion and proposed to tackle the problem with social network analysis that involved bipartite graph and link prediction. A bureaucratic career bipartite network model was developed to encode key information reflecting a candidate's service merit and the aggregated merit standards of an executive position. This allowed us to approximate merit measurement with node similarity. We implemented this candidacy evaluation approach and conducted experiments with data from Taiwan's bureaucratic career database. Empirical evaluation shows acceptable baseline performance and demonstrates feasibility of the link prediction approach to candidacy ranking. The results also seem to indicate that bureaucratic promotion for executive positions in Taiwan government is mostly a merit system, as opposed to at-will.},

In this paper, we study the following problem: Given a social network modeled as an {em edge-labeled graph} $G$, we aim to make a pre-specified subset of vertices of $G$ $k$-label sequence anonymous with the minimum number of edge additions. Here, the label sequence of a vertex is the sequence of labels of edges incident to it. The contributions of this paper are two fold: We provide a framework to show hardness results for different variants of social network anonymization using a common approach. We start by showing that $k$-label sequence anonymity of arbitrary labeled graphs is hard, and use this result to prove NP-hardness results for many other recently proposed notions of graph anonymization. Secondly, we present interesting algorithms and hardness for bipartite graphs. For unlabeled bipartite graphs, we show $k$-degree anonymity is in P for all $k geq 2$. For labeled bipartite graphs, we show that $k$-label sequence anonymity is in P for $k=2$ but it is NP-hard for $k geq 3$.},

Recently different researches have shown that there is a fairly strong concept of network among offenders. Analyzing these networks can help law enforcement agencies in designing more effective strategies for crime prevention and reduction. One of the important tasks in co-offending network analysis is central actors identification. In this paper, firstly we introduce a data model, called unified crime data model to bridge the conceptual gap between abstract crime data level and co-offending network mining level. Using this data model, we extract the co-offending network of five years real-world crime data. Then we apply different variations of centrality methods on the extracted network and discuss how key player identification and removal can help law enforcement agencies in policy making for crime reduction.},

abstract = {Social book marking Web sites have emerged recently for collecting and sharing of interesting Web sites among users. People can add Web pages to such sites as bookmarks and allow themselves as well as others to manipulate them. One of the key features of the social book marking sites is the ability of annotating a Web page when it is being bookmarked. The annotation usually contains a set of words or phrases, which are collectively known as tags, that could reveal the semantics of the annotated Web page. Efficient and effective search of Web pages can then be achieved via such tags. However, spam tags that are irrelevant to the content of Web pages often appear to deceive other users for malicious or commercial purposes. Various techniques have been devised to tackle such tag spam detection problem. Most of these techniques were able to detect a user that always annotate spam tags. However, finer levels of detection are seldom discussed. In this work, we will propose a method based on a text mining approach to discover the relations between Web pages and there tag posts. These relations are then used to compute the similarity between a Web page and its tag post to decide if it is a spam post. Preliminary experiments show that the accuracy of the post-level spam detection task is 83%.},

abstract = {Blog has become one of the most popular ways of communication among social communities since blog posts can be replied, commented, and even shared to other users in a convenient way. All posts and comments, no matter good or bad, have to be manually coordinated by blog owners. In order to prevent comment spam, most blog sites provide challenge-response tests such as CAPTCHA to ensure that the response is from human, instead of automatically generated by a computer. However, these tests cannot prohibit spammers from manually leaving spam messages. Existing studies of Chinese blog comment spam only focus on comments containing hyperlinks, which only stand for a small portion of blog comment spam. In this paper, we propose to include inter-comment Jaccard similarity in the features in addition to the post-comment similarity, stop words ratio, and comment length for blog comment classification. In order to verify the effects of inter-comment similarity features, we compared several classification algorithms such as C4.5, Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, and Neural Network. Experimental results showed that the feature combination of inter-comment and post-comment similarity under the classification of C4.5 achieves the best performance. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed inter-comment similarity feature for Chinese blog comment spam classification.},

abstract = {Social informatics is the core of Facebook's business and is its most valuable asset which consists of the social graph and the private data of over 500 million users. However, without secure methods of managing this data, Face book has become vulnerable to privacy risks and devaluation. In Facebook's model, users are asked upon access to grant applications the required permissions without sufficient knowledge of the applications' intentions. As a result, if they are deceived, users risk the exposure of sensitive and personal data. This paper presents a system dubbed FAITH (Face book Applications: Identification, Transformation &amp; Hyper visor) to mitigate or eliminate these issues by enhancing the management of social data. First, FAITH allows users to adjust the visibility of their social informatics for each individual application depending on how much they trust the application. Users can configure FAITH to let non-trusted applications run with the least privileges (least amount of social informatics) to minimize potential privacy leaks. Second, FAITH logs the activities of applications to assist users in making more secure decisions. Users can closely monitor each activity performed by applications to adjust their privacy settings more securely. Third, FAITH allows users to transform their social graph such that different applications see different social graphs preventing the formation of friendship inflation caused by applications. The implementation of FAITH only needs the resources and tools available to the public by Face book and requires no further cooperation from the social network. FAITH is a prototype system: the design and concept can be extended to secure other OSNs (Online Social Networks). Currently, FAITH contains thirteen Face book social applications and has been officially released for public usage with approximately two hundred monthly active users as of now.},

abstract = {Modern applications such as web knowledge base, network traffic monitoring and online social networks have made available an unprecedented amount of network data with rich types of interactions carrying multiple attributes, for instance, port number and time tick in the case of network traffic. The design of algorithms to leverage this structured relationship with the power of computing to assist researchers and practitioners for better understanding, exploration and navigation of this space of information has become a challenging, albeit rewarding, topic in social network analysis and data mining. The constantly growing scale and enriching genres of network data always demand higher levels of efficiency, robustness and generalizability where existing approaches with successes on small, homogeneous network data are likely to fall short. We introduce MultiAspectForensics, a handy tool to automatically detect and visualize novel sub graph patterns within a local community of nodes in a heterogenous network, such as a set of vertices that form a dense bipartite graph whose edges share exactly the same set of attributes. We apply the proposed method on three data sets from distinct application domains, present empirical results and discuss insights derived from these patterns discovered. Our algorithm, built on scalable tensor analysis procedures, captures spectral properties of network data and reveals informative signals for subsequent domain-specific study and investigation, such as suspicious port-scanning activities in the scenario of cyber-security monitoring.},

We present here the promising results we obtain, and the difficulties we face while extracting the quotations in this kind of textual content. These results are obtained from real data (from two information websites) which make the validation difficult. So, we create a validation protocol composed of two steps and based on human raters.

abstract = {A key problem for social network analysis is the lack of ground-truth data upon which to validate an analysis. Consider for example community-finding algorithms. The ``communities'' identified by such algorithms are typically justified on the basis of their structural properties, rather than on their ability to recover communities which can be independently verified. A ground truth of actual community data isn't always available and at best only partial ground-truth community information is. However, this problem isn't unique to community-finding algorithms. In previous publications, we introduced an automated Social Network Assembly Pipeline we refer to as SNAP. This is intended for the large scale actor identification, tie interference and strength measurement of social networks from non-relational data sets. In this paper we describe a validation study of SNAP through an intensive user-study of a portion of the individuals in the network. Individuals are asked to validate the network relationships uncovered by SNAP and where misclassified relationships are found, the individuals are interviewed in order to determine the underlying cause of the misclassification. The findings provide feedback on the rules through which relationships are inferred. For instance, it becomes clear that an error in actor identification can result in a propagation of this error though the network relations leading to follow-on relationship misclassifications. Also, we observe how outliers lead to a propagation of error in the inferred network. The results help us validate and invalidate different hypotheses we have about SNAP and suggests domain specific rule-sets for SNAP.},

abstract = {Social influence, the phenomenon that the actions of a user can induce her/his friends to behave in a similar way, plays a key role in many (online) social systems. For example, a company wants to market a new product through the effect of ``word of mouth'' in the social network. It wishes to find and convince a small number of influential users to adopt the product, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Fundamentally, we need to answer the following question: how to quantify the influence between two users in a large social network? To address this question, we propose a pair wise factor graph (PFG) model to model the social influence in social networks. An efficient algorithm is designed to learn the model and make inference. We further propose a dynamic factor graph (DFG) model to incorporate the time information. Experimental results on three different genres of data sets show that the proposed approaches can efficiently infer the dynamic social influence. The results are applied to the influence maximization problem, which aims to find a small subset of nodes (users) in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. Experiments show that the proposed approach can facilitate the application.},

abstract = {With the rise of network science as an exciting interdisciplinary research topic, efficient graph algorithms are in high demand. Problematically, many such algorithms measuring important properties of networks have asymptotic lower bounds that are quadratic, cubic, or higher in the number of vertices. For analysis of social networks, transportation networks, communication networks, and a host of others, computation is intractable. In these networks computation in serial fashion requires years or even decades. Fortunately, these same computational problems are often naturally parallel. We present here the design and implementation of a master-worker framework for easily computing such results in these circumstances. The user needs only to supply two small fragments of code describing the fundamental kernel of the computation. The framework automatically divides and distributes the workload and manages completion using an arbitrary number of heterogeneous computational resources. In practice, we have used thousands of machines and observed commensurate speedups. Writing only 31 lines of standard C++ code, we computed betweenness centrality on a network of 4.7M nodes in 25 hours.},

We formally define the probability that a substitution satisfies a PS-query with respect to a graph database. We then present the PMATCH algorithm to answer such queries and prove its correctness. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PMATCH is efficient and scales to massive social networks with over a billion edges.},

abstract = {Many important real-world systems, modeled naturally as complex networks, have heterogeneous interactions and complicated dependency structures. Link prediction in such networks must model the influences between heterogenous relationships and distinguish the formation mechanisms of each link type, a task which is beyond the simple topological features commonly used to score potential links. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistically weighted extension of the Adamic/Adar measure for heterogenous information networks, which we use to demonstrate the potential benefits of diverse evidence, particularly in cases where homogeneous relationships are very sparse. However, we also expose some fundamental flaws of traditional a priori link prediction. In accordance with previous research on homogeneous networks, we further demonstrate that a supervised approach to link prediction can enhance performance and is easily extended to the heterogeneous case. Finally, we present results on three diverse, real-world heterogeneous information networks and discuss the trends and tradeoffs of supervised and unsupervised link prediction in a multi-relational setting.},

The role of a node in the network is expressed in terms of the number of interactions it has with the rest of the network. Two roles are considered: the leader and the mediator with their corresponding measure: the degree centrality and the betweenness centrality.},

In the present paper, we propose a new analysis method for phenomena on networks based on a categorization of nodes. First, local statistics such as the average path length and the clustering coefficient for a node are calculated and assigned to the respective node. Then, the nodes are categorized using the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. Characteristic properties of the phenomena of interest are visualized for each category of nodes. The validity of our method is demonstrated using the results of two simulation models.},

abstract = {This study investigates the network characteristics of adolescent friendship networks and the interaction between network characteristics and gender. Two competing hypotheses for closure and openness are derived and tested. Adolescents might strive for network closure, because this facilitates trust and trustworthiness among their friends. However, openness can also be beneficial because it facilitates establishing multi-layered identities and finding novel ideas for school tasks. The hypothesis for interaction between structure and gender is derived from the argument that gender influences the criteria for seeking and making friends during adolescence. SIENA is used to estimate the effects of network and individual characteristics on friendship formation. The data consists of longitudinal friendship nominations of 410 Taiwanese adolescents. We find that adolescents have a tendency to establish friendships that increase network closure. This tendency is stronger for male than for female adolescents in single-gender classes. On the contrary, the tendency towards network closure is stronger for female than for male adolescents in mixed-gender classes.},

In this paper, we propose a new construct to capture the notion of agents using additional information sources, such as media, to obtain multiple affirmations of belief information through an information score. We use this new construct to create a feedback learning loop that allows agents to learn beliefs with social influences varying dynamically with the credibility of the information on such beliefs. We build a new social learning mechanism, without the constraining row-stochasticity assumptions on social influence, and show that with information sources driving social influences, the beliefs can converge, and not necessarily to a consensus, even with strong connectivity. In this process of learning agents with a similar alignment between exogenous information sources and beliefs 'group' together, and this reflects in the structure of social influences. The results of the new learning algorithm are demonstrated on a small, fully connected social network.},

Micro-blogs allows bloggers to exchange information, discuss ideas, and share experiences with friends or even strangers with similar interests. In this paper, we try to identify ways to measure how information is propagated in micro-blogs. More specifically, we consider the following issues. (1) How to quantify a person s capability to disseminate ideas via a micro-blog. (2) How to measure the extent of propagation of a concept in a micro-blog. (3) How to demonstrate and visualize information propagation in a micro-blog. We propose methods to effectively measure each user s ability to disseminate information via micro-blogs. The design of the measure considers three factors: (a) the number of people influenced, (b) the speed of propagation, and (c) the geographic distance of the propagation. We also provide an online demonstration micro-blog system that allows the users to explore the information propagation. The system shows the propagation paths and social graphs, influence scores, timelines, and geographical information among people for the user-given terms.},

Although there are tangible benefits in socialness, there is little research in its modeling. In this paper, we study socialness as a property that can be associated with items, beyond its traditional association with people. We aim to model an item's socialness as a quantitative measure based on the how popular the item is adopted by members of multiple communities. We propose two socialness models, namely Basic and Mutual Dependency, to compute item socialness based on different sets of principles. In developing the Mutual Dependency Model, we demonstrate that items' socialness can be related to the socialness of communities. Our model have been evaluated on a set of users and application items from a mobile social network. We also conducted experiments to study how socialness can be related to network effects such as homophily, social influence and friendship formation.},

In this paper, we propose a new notion of expertise, which we call user insight. User insight denotes the user s expertise in finding Web pages that are useful or have the potential to be popular pages before other users find them. To address the issue, we refer to three major types of Web pages, namely, isolated, well-known, and burgeoning. Burgeoning pages are exceptionally useful and attractive for users in a folksonomy system. In our paper, we build a time-based algorithm to estimate user insight. In addition, we discuss the social relationship within fan networks, and we propose a link-based algorithm called CAIS (Community-based Annotation Insight Search) to realize the reinforcement between users, communities and pages. Finally, we design several experiments to evaluate the performance of CAIS and compare it to other approaches. We prove that CAIS has a better performance for the user ranking of simulated data and real data from Delicious.},

Traditional link prediction methods are designed to find friends solely relying on social network information. With location and trajectory data available, we can generate more accurate and geographically related results, and help web-based social service users find more friends in the real world. Aiming to recommend geographically related friends in social network, a three-step statistical recommendation approach is proposed for GPS-enabled cyber-physical social network. By combining GPS information and social network structures, we build a pattern-based heterogeneous information network. Links inside this network reflect both people's geographical information, and their social relationships. Our approach estimates link relevance and finds promising geo-friends by employing a random walk process on the heterogeneous information network. Empirical studies from both synthetic datasets and real-life dataset demonstrate the power of merging GPS data and social graph structure, and suggest our method outperforms other methods for friends recommendation in GPS-based cyber-physical social network.},

abstract = {As the booming of social network sites (SNSs), people adapt to communicate and share information via internet recently. According to great business opportunities emerging in SNSs, entrepreneurs strive to explore the potential needs inside users and then provide interesting feature functions on SNS platforms. The Means-End Chain (MECs) research method has been widely used to explore customers perceived values in selecting products. It is a good approach to help entrepreneurs finding the most appreciated product features. But however, while adopting MECs, researchers suffer the hassle of defining Attribute, Consequence and Value elements (ACV elements) from interview data. In addition, such context analyzing work heavily relies on researchers subjective opinions, so that the research conclusions might be difficult to replicate and the contributions are limited. Therefore, this paper aims to propose hybrid miming techniques to automatically discover Attribute, Consequence and Value elements which are the most essential components in MEC approach. A case on studying customers perceived values of social network cites is conducted by the proposed hybrid approach, and the experimental results show our method can discover the ACV elements effectively.},

Given the scale and complexity of modern day social networks, detecting ``reasonable'' communities is an even harder problem. Since the first use of k-means algorithm in 1960s, many community detection algorithms have been invented - most of which are developed with specific goals in mind and the idea of detecting ``meaningful'' communities varies widely from one algorithm to another. With the increasing number of community detection algorithms, there has been an advent of a number of evaluation measures and objective functions such as modularity and internal density. In this paper we divide methods of measurements in to two categories, according to whether they rely on ground-truth or not. Our work is aiming to answer whether these general used objective functions are well consistent with the real performance of community detection algorithms across a number of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Seven representative algorithms are compared under various performance metrics, and on various real world social networks.},

For non-designed KO, contrarily, the FD group has more time spent than FI group. (2) FI style is more likely to acquire knowledge from internal sources while FD prefers external where they can perform social interactions as the primary means to acquire knowledge. (3) FI group is likely monotonous to stick firmly with common or preferred passive knowledge resources, on the other hand, the learning process of FD group seems to be more varied, and often passing through in-between several different knowledge sources.

With a large member base, users of a dating network are overloaded with choices about their ideal partners. Recommendation methods can be utilized to overcome this problem. However, traditional recommendation methods do not work effectively for online dating networks where the dataset is sparse and large, and a two-way matching is required. This paper applies social networking concepts to solve the problem of developing a recommendation method for online dating networks. We propose a method by using clustering, SimRank and adapted SimRank algorithms to recommend matching candidates. Empirical results show that the proposed method can achieve nearly double the performance of the traditional collaborative filtering and common neighbor methods of recommendation.},

abstract = {The main characteristic of collaborative filtering is to provide personalized recommendations to a customer based on the customer profile, without considering content information about domain items. In this paper, we investigated to use a relevance feedback mechanism in the collaborative recommendation system. First, we used the Self-organizing Map (SOM) method to avoid suffering from the scalability and sparsity problem in the collaborative filtering. In addition, we adopted the Statistical Attribute Distance (SAD) method which uses the similarity in statistics of customers ratings to calculate customer correlations, instead of using the statistics of customers that rate for similar items. Then, the multi-tier granule mining algorithm was used to find association rules. Finally, with the relevance feedback mechanism and the association rules, the recommendations could be refined to provide customers more relevance information.},

Specifically, there is clearly a lack of research on looking into overall structures and structural heterogeneities of social networks. This research investigates structural heterogeneities between online social networks in different product categories. We collected data from four online networks in different product categories from the most popular social networking site in Taiwan. Social network analysis was performed to understand the network structures. The findings demonstrate the structural heterogeneities between these networks and we also provide managerial implications for practitioners.},

Individuals and companies promote their products or services in search engines through textual ads, alongside the organic search results triggered by a specific query. For this purpose, advertisers must create advertising campaigns. The development of these campaigns is a laborious task involving significant human resources and expertise. In this paper we propose a system for multiword keyword recommendations in the context of developing a web advertising campaign in a semiautomatic manner. Given a landing page, the system extracts relevant terms consisted of two or three words to match a potential search query. Furthermore, it proposes the most relevant keywords and other suggested terms that do not exist in the landing page text using search result snippets. In addition, we present blind testing experiments on real world data indicating that our approach outperforms prominent existing industrial solutions in most of the cases.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, people have been expressing more and more of their personalities online. Online social networks such as Facebook.com capture much of individuals' personalities through their published interests, attributes and social interactions. Knowledge of an individual's personality can be of wide utility, either for social research, targeted marketing or a variety of other fields A key problem to predicting and utilizing personality information is the myriad of ways it is expressed across various people, locations and cultures. Similarly, a model predicting personality based on online data which cannot be extrapolated to "real world" situations is of limited utility for researchers. This paper presents initial work done on generating a probabilistic model of personality which uses representations of people's connections to other people, places, cultures, and ideas, as expressed through Face book. To this end, personality was predicted using a machine learning method known as a Bayesian Network. The model was trained using Face book data combined with external data sources to allow further inference. The results of this paper present one predictive model of personality that this project has produced. This model demonstrates the potential of this methodology in two ways: First, it is able to explain up to 56% of all variation in a personality trait from a sample of 615 individuals. Second it is able to clearly present how this variability is explained through findings such as how to determine how agreeable a man is based on his age, number of Face book wall posts, and his willingness to disclose his preference for music made by Lady Gaga.},

We examined three different game servers from the Ever Quest II game logs. In all three servers, the results from our analyses suggest that increase in social diversity in terms of characters and classes encountered moderately negatively correlates with player performance. Based on this finding, we built predictive models to predict player's future performance based on past performance and social diversity in terms of mentoring activities. Our results indicate that 1) models employing past performance and social diversity perform better and 2) prediction for mentors is generally better than that for apprentices.},

Consequently, a lot of researchers are studying this social network lively.

It uses mainly texts to present information in real-time, and its users use a computer or a mobile device to upload their own opinions or ideas. A lot of texts from users contain important and various information. We will get this information we need real-time if semantic can be extracted from texts on a social network. In this case, Opinion mining should be useful to extract semantic from social network.

This paper approaches the relevant blog problem in the top search results against the general topic queries. It pursues a study of irrelevant blogs appearing in the top search results of Google Blog Search for the blog spot domains. We define metrics for irrelevant blogs by observing the qualitative relevance of content and by analyzing the link structure of those blogs.

Crime ontology for terrorist groups in Istanbul is created by using their criminal history and choices such as selection of crimes, attacking methods and modus operandi. Terrorist groups of Istanbul are attached to this ontology as nodes connected to their attacks. A similarity measure (COSM) is developed according to this ontology. COSM results for Istanbul terrorist groups performed better than two common similarity measures, cosine and Jaccard. COSM similarity result is presented to domain experts in hierarchical clustering and they gave positive feedback. COSM, which is based on attributes of crimes, can also be applied to other types of social networks for measuring similarity.},

abstract = {Complex networks have been receiving increasing attention by the scientific community, thanks also to the increasing availability of real-world network data. In the last years, the multidimensional nature of many real world networks has been pointed out, i.e. many networks containing multiple connections between any pair of nodes have been analyzed. Despite the importance of analyzing this kind of networks was recognized by previous works, a complete framework for multidimensional network analysis is still missing. Such a framework would enable the analysts to study different phenomena, that can be either the generalization to the multidimensional setting of what happens inmonodimensional network, or a new class of phenomena induced by the additional degree of complexity that multidimensionality provides in real networks. The aim of this paper is then to give the basis for multidimensional network analysis: we develop a solid repertoire of basic concepts and analytical measures, which takes into account the general structure of multidimensional networks. We tested our framework on a real world multidimensional network, showing the validity and the meaningfulness of the measures introduced, that are able to extract important, nonrandom, information about complex phenomena.},

abstract = {Complex networks have been receiving increasing attention by the scientific community, also due to the availability of massive network data from diverse domains. One problem studied so far in complex network analysis is Community Discovery, i.e. the detection of group of nodes densely connected, or highly related. However, one aspect of such networks has been disregarded so far: real networks are often multidimensional, i.e. many connections may reside between any two nodes, either to reflect different kinds of relationships, or to connect nodes by different values of the same type of tie. In this context, the problem of Community Discovery has to be redefined, taking into account multidimensionality. In this paper, we attempt to do so, by defining the problem in the multidimensional context, and by introducing also a new measure able to characterize the communities found. We then provide a complete framework for finding and characterizing multidimensional communities. Our experiments on real world multidimensional networks support the methodology proposed in this paper, and open the way for a new class of algorithms, aimed at capturing the multifaceted complexity of connections among nodes in a network.},

The first method uses separate weighted polynomial regression models for each web page, while the second algorithm capitalizes on group behavior, thus taking advantage of the possible interdependence between web pages. The prediction quality is quantified as the similarity between the predicted and the actual rankings and compared to alternative baseline predictor.

In macro-level, both the traditional and time-scale approaches to degree centrality can explain the relationship between the 'degree' attribute of doctor-patient network and LOS.

In this paper, we quantify the prevalence of flash crowd events for a popular social discussion board (Digg). We measured the response times of 1289 unique popular websites. We were able to verify that 89% of the popular URLs suffered variations in their response times. By analyzing the content and structure of the social discussions, we were able to forecast accurately for 86% of the popular web sites within 5 minutes of their submission and 95% of the sites when more (5 hours) of social content became available. Our work indicates that we can effectively leverage social activity to forecast network events that will be otherwise infeasible to anticipate.},

abstract = {With the popularity of multimedia and network technologies, it is now often to attach large size of multimedia dataset to emails. However, delivering large volume of multimedia data over an enterprise email system can easily bring down the quality of overall network service. Moreover, without some sort of restrictions, many enterprises found that the network resource was occupied for personal interests. The business communication over emails thus suffers undesirable delays and cause damages to businesses. The competition to use email service therefore become an issue that many enterprises have to deal with. Obviously, enterprises should manage the email service so that business emails have the priority over personal usages. This management requires an effective methodology to classify enterprise emails into official and private emails, and the development of the method is the goal of this work. To achieve the accuracy of a desired classification methodology, we normally anticipated the developed method to survey as much information as possible. On the other hand, monitoring details of the email contents not only can decrease the performance of the method, but it also may violate the privacy rights that many legal regulation systems now protect. The balance of pursuing accurate classification and protecting privacy rights becomes a challenge for this problem. With the discussed challenges in mind, we develop an email classification method based on social features, rather than surveying the email contents. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study to address the aforementioned problems. We obtain social features from emails to represent the input vector of support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Preliminary results show that our methodology can classify emails with a high accuracy. Compared with the other content-based feature of email, our work shows that exploring social features is a promising direction to solve similar email classification problems.},

Here, we study the Wikipedia Request for Adminship (RfA) process within the context of a social network and pinpoint several factors influencing different stages of the voting process. The facets explored are: election participation, decision making in elections, and election outcome. We find that voters tend to participate in elections that their contacts have participated in. Furthermore, there is evidence showing that an individual's decision-making is influenced by his contacts' actions. The properties of voters within the social graph were also studied, results reveal that candidates who gain the support of an influential coalition tend to succeed in elections.},

However, some key players are not always appeared in the clique, therefore, clique detection could not identify some core members in social networks. In this paper, we define a generalization of the dense sub graph problem by an additional distance restriction to the nodes of the dense sub graph which is a quasi-clique in fact. We propose a new quasi-clique detection algorithm based on the definition of dense sub graph, and a novel optimization techniques based on idea of synchronization, which can prune the unpromising and redundant alien from the dense sub graph. The proposed methods could discover quasi-cliques and core players that are not shown in clique.},

With the resulting network, the first algorithm computes each author's reputation value considering only direct referential activities while the second considers indirect activities as well. We discuss the reputation values computed by the two algorithms and compare them with the reputation ratings given by a human domain expert. We also analyze the social network through a community detection algorithm. We observed several interesting phenomena including the network being scale-free and having negative assortativity.},

A prototype of this method is implemented, includes following stages: Firstly, categories of virtual identity are predefined, and each category has multiple properties, such as geographical region, hobby, education, age, interested topic/keywords, etc. Secondly, based on category information, each identity will foster its own "life" semantically, such as edit profile and update status, find hot related news/topic from Google then post to wall, find related groups/networks then request to add in, and find/like/create/comment pages/posts, etc. Thirdly, artificial identity will evolve to multiple stages according to its status (for example, number of friends of real people), single identity with different evolutionary stages is linked together to a group that will help to ensure the number of attack edges [3].},

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) based supervised framework is also employed to identify the three components from the blog sentences and it outperforms the baseline system. As the topic of a document is not always conveyed at the sentence level, the similarity between a document's overall topic and sentential topic is measured through semantic clustering approach. Two different approaches are adopted to identify the many to many relationships among the holders and topics on Ekman's six emotions. One is based from the perspectives of the holders and other is with respect to topics. The two way evaluation of Ekman's six emotions achieves precision, recall and F-Score of 65.02%, 76.23% and 70.18% for 10 bloggers and 71.02%, 78.47% and 74.55% for 8 different topics on 512 test sentences respectively.},

This study investigates 203 significant personality adjectives to find out the stable intrinsic value and the connotation of every adjective in context is introduced for vectorization comparison. The 203 phrases create 41209 similar scores totally. This study takes students of Tamkang University in Taiwan as subjects for establishing adjective database. The valid samples received are 973, the recovery rate being 83.87%. The following important conclusions are received after analysis, discussion and outcome induction: (1) In naturally formed interpersonal groups, openness to experience will be taken as the most important formative indicator. (2) Groups under high task environment will seek to take conscientiousness as the primary formative indicator to converge into task groups. (3) Lover relationship takes partial personality similarity as the predominant phenomenon. The convergence of group personality will show comparatively obvious concentration.},

abstract = {Social media platforms have become a forum for giving a voice to the masses with a significant proportion of those masses coming from the developing world. This was largely evidenced through the significant role played by social media platforms in the recent uprisings in the Arab world. In this paper, we take up a study of social media engagement patterns of users from the developing world through a study of Twitter's role during the recent Tunisian uprising. Motivated by the results of a user survey conducted mainly for users from the developing world who tweeted heavily during the uprisings in the Arab world, we propose a novel method for subjectivity analysis of tweets corresponding to political events in the developing world. Our proposed method differs from previous subjectivity analysis approaches in that it is the first method that takes into account social features of social media platforms for the subjectivity classification task. Through experimental evaluations, we observe the accuracy of the proposed method to be 83.3% which demonstrates a promising outcome for large-scale application of our proposed subjectivity analysis technique.},

abstract = {With the advent of Web 2.0 technology, researchers have attempted to use Web 2.0 tools to develop adaptive and cooperative learning environments. However, in building learning and teaching diagnostic system, one of the major difficulties is the lack of prior knowledge to help learners read and understand what they read in articles. Moreover, because of the lack of a mechanism to assist teachers in monitoring the running activities and student progress, such that constructive suggestions can be given to the students and tutoring strategies can be improved accordingly. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for calculating semantically meaningful prior knowledge and generating spreading energy for discovering student s reading status in semantic networks using a modified version of Semantic Analysis and Social Network techniques. An application to the development of a Tag-based Collaborative reading learning system is very useful for teachers and students.},

Opinions of netizens in the cyberspace have emerged and become one of the major public opinions in the real world. One of the phenomenon rising recently over the Internet that most represent the influence between the virtual and real world is human flesh search (HFS). Usually, the HFS object is incompatible with social justice or violation of the mainstream moral characters, or events. This §violation of moral triggers the HFS process either in the cyberspace or in the real world. HFS has arose numerous controversies, especially the dilemmas between privacy violation and public opinion. Literatures and studies of HSF are mainly from China. International journals or periodical literatures target on this issue are very few. In addition, current studies are mainly qualitative studies lacking of quantitative and theoretical model building and empirical research. Therefore, it is necessary to acquire better understanding of HSF structure and evolving process. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broad discussion and summarized attributes of HFS. Based on reviews of more than twenty journal papers and articles regarding HFS, this study hopes to formulate a reference framework for future HFS studies.},

When some unfair events happen, it is counterproductive not only to the performance of the organization, but to organizational efficacy as well. Presses are time-conscious organizations, but they have to face the difficulty of resource distribution. The main purpose of this study is to examine organizational justice in presses. Because presses are so different from other organizations, there must be some kinds of important elements composing their organizational justice. In the procedure of news gathering, reporters always have to face the uncertainty of those events. If presses emphasize too much on the equity of distribution, it is possible that they may miss the deadline, or even lose the news. So presses seem to need another kind of evaluation to appraise their organizational justice. This paper would focus on the campus media, finding how students perform when they face the assignments of news gathering, and what strategies to do justice in this media could affect students self-efficacy.},

There were 75 participants recruited to attend this study. The results indicate the dynamic social network types of power-dependences, closeness distance, and cooperation/competition are key factors to impact negative emotional behaviors and determine the hostility behaviors significantly.

For instance, Face book focuses on social activities, Twitter and Plurk are both focus on the interaction of users through short messages (which are so-called microblogs). Therefore, there are more than millions of users registered in these websites and become places where full of marketing possibilities. Thus, it is an important issue to assist companies to understand the users in the social networking websites in order to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of target marketing. In this paper, we have proposed the architecture of a social recommendation system based on the data from microblogs. The social recommendation system is conducted according to the messages and social structure of target users. The similarity of the discovered features of users and products will then be calculated as the essence of the recommendation engine. A case study will be included to present how the recommendation system works based on real data that collected from Plurk.},

To realize AN is an important but difficult work because of the constituents of AN are complicated and dynamic variation. In this research, two Taiwan academic networks are established from the perspectives of academic conference topic and participant committee. Each academic conference is regarded as an AN node to establish the conference academic network. In addition, there are two connection types between AN nodes, including: the relationship among CFP topics (academic conference topic perspective) and the relationship between committee member (participant committee perspective). Finally, 15 IT/IM relative target conferences in Taiwan 2009 are analyzed via social network analysis methodology. According to experiment result, the values of degree and betweeness reveal some interesting findings, such as TANET, OOTA and IMP are top three important bridge conferences in Taiwan. Additionally, as the cluster analyzed result shown, academic network somehow represents domain expertise because of the committee are grouped according to their research domains. These finding is consistence with the reality academic network in Taiwan and helpful information for Taiwan academic network understanding.},

In this work, a network of foreign policy event interactions is developed and then used to describe the state of the international system by estimating the behavioral distances from all relevant actors to the US. Using a graph theoretic approach, we develop a tool for estimating behavioral distances through direct network links when behavior is present, and indirect network paths when direct behavior is unobserved. The international system is examined in temporal aggregations of 60 and 30 days prior to and following the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Both periods see distancing from the US as the wars approach, and a partial return to the prior state by 60 days after the initiation of conflict. The overall position of the US and the response of other nations towards the US indicates that the systemic leadership role of the US is diminished in behavioral relationships with a moderate number of actors.},

Here, a model has been developed in the domain of\^{a} Academic collaboration' which satisfies all the above characteristics, based on some existing social network models. In addition, this model facilitates interaction between various communities (academic/research groups).This model gives very high clustering coefficient by retaining the asymptotically scale-free degree distribution. Here the community structure is raised from a mixture of random attachment and implicit preferential attachment. In addition to earlier works which only considered Neighbor of Initial Contact (NIC) as implicit preferential contact, we have considered Neighbor of Neighbor of Initial Contact (NNIC)also. This model supports the occurrence of a contact between two Initial contacts if the new vertex chooses more than one initial contacts. This ultimately will develop a complex social network rather than the one that was taken as basic reference.},

abstract = {In many metropolitan areas, traffic congestion is an escalating problem which causes a significant waste of money and time. Nowadays, cars equipped with GPS devices become widespread. The location information of those cars is very useful for estimate traffic condition in the complex city road network. Using the accurate and real time traffic condition, we can provide dynamic route guidance to ease traffic congestion. In this paper, we proposed a speed pattern model, called two phase piecewise linear speed model (2PEED), to estimate traffic condition and represent speed pattern in a road network using GPS data collected vehicles. With the estimated traffic condition and speed pattern, a proposed classification-based route guidance approach using machine learning technique provides dynamic routing for drivers. Using both current traffic data and the experience learned from history data, our route guidance approach is able to accurately predict the future traffic condition and selects a best route. We give simulation results to show that the proposed approach is able to select and dynamically update a route to prove drivers a best (e.g., less traffic and shortest travel time) route to their destination.},

Due to this popularity, they have become an important platform for business and marketing activities. In this paper, we understand the availability and the need of social networking sites with the mobile environment. The existing mobile recommender systems focus on targeting the users based on predicted demographics rather than the interests of the user. By extracting users' information from social networking sites, we design four novel filters to improve the targeting accuracy of the mobile service providers. Finally we have applied the Bayesian approach on the filters to arrive at a proper response percentage of the targeted customers. In essence, we ensure that based on applied strategy of understanding the customer's unique preferences, mobile service providers can launch specific campaigns on selected groups of users to get useful feedback. Moreover, it improves customer loyalty towards the operator. We have evaluated our findings through standard techniques on real world data.},

We devise to estimate the relevance of an entry to the user goal by observing eye movements as implicit feedback. Specifically, this study proposes a framework that assumes eye movement measures can be used to infer a user s cognition. A rating task was conducted in which subjects were required to judge whether an image was relevant to a word. Results showed that the total fixation duration and the fixation count can be used to discriminate between the relevant and irrelevant conditions, in contrast, the first fixation duration cannot. In addition, the subjective rating and relevancy manipulation interacted on the total fixation duration. Converging evidence verifies the assumption we have proposed.},

abstract = {Web of Things is a practice towards Internet of Things. It enables physical digital objects to be organised as web resources. Mobility enables mobile phones as a great media to engage people with operations to those extended web resources in Web of Things. Mobile engagements include three scopes with differences on networking and purposing. We illustrate each engagement with specific examples. Each engagement could complement each other to improve overall performance. In practice, apps are the actual implementations for mobile engagement. Meanwhile, privacy control of digital footprint needs to be explored further for mobile engagement because of data explosion in the Web of Things.},

abstract = {The research area of Social networks analysis has been recognized as extremely time-consuming tasks as well as large storage space is always necessary in order to store the social data, especially to deal with the data in the World Wide Web. Therefore, how to design an architecture and environment for performing social networks analysis is very essential. In this paper, we proposed a data warehousing and analyzing system which is based on the concept of cloud computing. The system has also been implemented and evaluated under the proposed environment with different cloud computing approaches.},

abstract = {As with rapid growth of the computer technology, E-learning systems usually require many hardware and software resources, There are numerous educational institutions that cannot offer such investments, and cloud learning platform is the best solution for them. This paper proposes a model of using cloud computing and learning network upon cloud-learning solutions development. The cloud-learning platform combined with different types of games is gradually noticed by people because it can enhance user learning motivation. This research has developed a Chinese language cloud-learning system for the new immigrant based on games mode, and investigated the properties of game-based cloud-learning system, expecting to help more and more new immigrants in Taiwan. The basic concept for designing the system is developing the learning games network using digital materials, which is applied to the cloud learning platform to attract the immigrant residents and assist them to improve Chinese language skills.},

abstract = {This paper tried to apply cloud computing technology in social network analysis for a comprehensive home financial learning environment that individual investors may use as a reference in establishing web-based learning and investment platforms. The major contributions were described in three parts. First, this paper advanced the social network analysis technology to be able to handle millions of nodes and links. Second, we demonstrate how cloud computing can be applied to advanced computing in social network. Third, we performed several intelligent analyses on a very popular social network, IHFILE, to identify some interesting and important features of it. In addition to analyzing a homogeneous social network such as IHFILE, we also propose direction of how cloud computing can be performed on a social network analysis as our future work.},
