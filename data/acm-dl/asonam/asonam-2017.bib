abstract = {It is known that many Twitter users are bots, which are accounts controlled and sometimes created by computers. Twitter bots can send spam tweets, manipulate public opinion and be used for online fraud. Here we report the discovery, retrieval, and analysis of the 'Star Wars' botnet in Twitter, which consists of more than 350,000 bots tweeting random quotations exclusively from Star Wars novels. The botnet contains a single type of bot, showing exactly the same properties throughout the botnet. It is unusually large, many times larger than other available datasets. It provides a valuable source of ground truth for research on Twitter bots. We analysed and revealed rich details on how the botnet was designed and created. As of this writing, the Star Wars bots are still alive in Twitter. They have survived since their creation in 2013, despite the increasing efforts in recent years to detect and remove Twitter bots. We also reflect on the 'unconventional' way in which we discovered the Star Wars bots, and discuss the current problems and future challenges of Twitter bot detection.},

abstract = {Population control policies are proposed and in some places employed as a means towards curbing population growth. This paper is concerned with a disturbing side-effect of such policies, namely, the potential risk of societal fragmentation due to changes in the distribution of family sizes. This effect is illustrated in some simple settings and demonstrated by simulation. In addition, the dependence of societal fragmentation on family size distribution is analyzed. In particular, it is shown that under the studied model, any population control policy that disallows families of 3 or more children incurs the possible risk of societal fragmentation.},

abstract = {Accessibility researchers have difficulty recruiting representative participants with disabilities given their scarcity. The rich information on social media provides accessibility researchers with a new approach to collecting data about these populations. Because social media is used by multiple stakeholders, a major barrier to this approach is differentiating representative users who have disabilities from unrepresentative users who do not. We (1) introduce an empirical study that compares representative users who are amputees with unrepresentative users in terms of linguistic behavior, online interaction, and community characteristics on Reddit and (2) develop a feature extraction method based on statistical analyses and graph mining to classify representative users. Those features allow us to detect amputees using a supervised learning method with an overall accuracy of 88% in amputee-related subreddits. Our findings improve our understanding of anonymous online users with physical disabilities, and can inform better tools for online data collection for accessibility researchers.},

abstract = {Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is the most commonly used density-based clustering algorithm, where it can discover multiple clusters with arbitrary shapes. DBSCAN works properly when the input data type is homogeneous, but the DBSCAN's approach may not be sufficient when the input dataset has textual heterogeneity (e.g., when we intend to find clusters from geo-tagged posts on social media relevant to a certain point-of-interest (POI)), thus leading to poor performance. In this paper, we present DBSTexC, a new density-based clustering algorithm using spatio--textual information on Twitter. We first define POI-relevant and POI-irrelevant tweets as the records that contain and do not contain a POI name or its coherent variations, respectively. By taking into account the fractions of POI-relevant and POI-irrelevant tweets, our DBSTexC algorithm shows a much higher clustering quality than the DBSCAN case in terms of the F1 score and its variants. DBSTexC can be thought of as a generalized version of DBSCAN due to the findings that it performs identically as DBSCAN when the inputs are homogeneous and far outperforms DBSCAN when the heterogeneous input data type is given.},

abstract = {In recent times, people regularly discuss about poor travel experience due to various road closure incidents in the social networking sites. One of the fallouts of these road blocking incidents is the dynamic shift in regular taxi pickup locations. Although traffic monitoring from social media content has lately gained widespread interest, however, none of the recent works has tried to understand this relocation of taxi pickup hotspots during any road closure activity. In this work, we have tried to predict the taxi pickup hotspots, during various road closure incidents, using their past taxi pickup trend. We have proposed a two-step methodology. First, we identify and extract road closure information from social network posts. Second, leveraging the inferred knowledge, prediction of taxi pickup hotspot is done near the activity location with an average accuracy of ~ 86.04%, where the predicted locations are within an average radius of only 0.011 mile from the original hotspots.},

abstract = {Organizations use data to support different business processes. Data may become unclean because of corruptions in the central quality aspects due to factors such as duplicate records, outdated data, inconsistent values, incomplete information, or inaccurate values. Real datasets are usually not available for reasons such as privacy constraints. In the existing systems that generate or corrupt synthetic data, the intrinsic characteristics of data may not satisfy the quality aspects, and the injected types of errors do not corrupt multiple data quality aspects. Also, a lack of common datasets is a primary reason that representative comparisons between algorithms of different data quality management approaches are not possible. To address these issues, we present datumPIPE, a system that allows for the generation of data that satisfies a set of integrity constraints, including functional dependencies (FDs), conditional functional dependencies (CFDs), and inclusion dependencies (INDs). Also, datumPIPE provides the functionality to generate other types of attribute values such as sensors and personal data. It also allows for the corruption of the generated data through the introduction of quality issues in the central data quality aspects.},

The classifier uses a soft-classification scheme, where it generates a likelihood score for a tweet to match each of the 14 categories. The initial version of our tool covers five languages, namely: English, Arabic, French, German, and Russian. More languages are to be covered in next releases. The classification model created for each language is generated from hundreds of thousands of training tweets. Our evaluation to the classifier shows superior accuracy compared to standard manual methods. Our reported accuracy is 84% based on crowd preferences over a balanced test set of English tweets covering all 14 classes.},

abstract = {With the development of Internet, we are gradually entering the era of big data. The size of network is increasing and the structure of network is becoming more complex. Community is a unique network structure with great research value. The task of community analysis goes through two separate phases: first, detection of meaningful community structure from a network, and second, evaluation of the appropriateness of the detected community structure. With the popularity of network research, many community detection algorithms emerged which can be grouped in categories, based on different criteria. In order to applicate community detection algorithms in real-world network analysis, we need to measure the performance of the algorithm. The performance depends on two points, that is, whether the algorithm can give the result of community division in an acceptable time, and whether the algorithm can reveal the community structure of the network with high quality. In recent years, systems used to analyze network and detect community are mushrooming. However, existing systems rarely have evaluation function, either providing social network analysis or providing data analysis service. We need a tool to evaluate community detection algorithms. In response to the challenge, the Community Evaluation System (CES) is proposed to meet the demands of community detection algorithms' evaluation. CES can evaluate community detection algorithms with multiple metrics. It uses B/S mode, integrates Spark, Yarn and HDFS technology to support the operation of large-scale data, and experiments prove that it is effective.},

To cope with the noisy nature of the social media imagery data, we use a deep neural network and perceptual hashing techniques to filter out irrelevant and duplicate images. Furthermore, we present a specific use case to assess the severity of infrastructure damage incurred by a disaster. The evaluations of the system on existing disaster datasets as well as a real-world deployment during a recent cyclone prove the effectiveness of the system.},

Our algorithm handles these situations by extending the HeadTail algorithm of Simpson, Seshadhri, and McGregor [20]. We provide an implementation of HyperHeadTail and demonstrate its utility on both synthetic and real-world data sets. We show that HyperHeadTail offers similar performance to HeadTail, while also providing additional functionality for tracking dynamic graphs that previous algorithms cannot efficiently achieve. We show that with a space usage on the order of 8% of the number of vertices in a graph, we were able to achieve a Relative Hausdorff distance of .27.},

abstract = {Network embedding is an effective method to learn a low-dimensional feature vector representation for each node of a given network. In this paper, we propose a deep network embedding model with aggregated proximity preserving (DNE-APP). Firstly, an overall network proximity matrix is generated to capture both local and global network structural information, by aggregating different k-th order network proximities between different nodes. Then, a semi-supervised stacked auto-encoder is employed to learn the hidden representations which can best preserve the aggregated proximity in the original network, and also map the node pairs with higher proximity closer to each other in the embedding space. With the hidden representations learned by DNE-APP, we apply vector-based machine learning techniques to conduct node classification and link label prediction tasks on the real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DNE-APP model over the state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms.},

Traditional frameworks for dynamic graphs have relied on processing only the stream of edges added into or deleted from an evolving graph, but not any additional related information such as the degrees or neighbor lists of nodes associated with the edges. In this paper, we propose a new edge sampling framework for big-graph analytics in dynamic graphs which enhances the traditional model and offers significantly improved trade-off between accuracy and computational/memory costs in the running estimates of a graph's properties. To demonstrate this higher accuracy using the framework, we present a new sampling algorithm, called Edge Sample and Discard, which generates an unbiased estimate of the total number of triangles in a fully dynamic graph. The experimental results show that, with the help of the neighborhood information of the sampled edges, the accuracy achieved by our algorithm is substantially better than the accuracy achieved by current state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Our goal is not only to predict links/relationships more accurately but also to provide more viable paths to facilitate the formation of new links/relationships. A relationship prediction method based on multi-label learning named ML3P is proposed. In ML3P, each meta-path between nodes is regarded as a type of relationship and is given a label. Under the framework of multi-label learning, any potential relationship including the target relationship can be predicted. The results of comparative experiments in DBLP and Twitter datasets show that ML3P better uses heterogeneous information in supervised learning process and thus achieves better performance. Moreover, our method can output the correlation between relationships.},

Considering the intricacy of this problem and the requirement of scalability, the existing methods are not scalable. On the other hand, the connections among vertices in many real world contagions are usually not solely binary entities (either present or not) but have associated magnitudes and directions. We formulate the flow-aware vertex protection (FAVP) problem to elaborate more efficient and realistic way to prevent infection spreading in graphs by protecting a set of vertices. We also demonstrate that the FAVP problem is NP-Hard. Finally, we propose an efficient and scalable algorithm, called GraphShield by taking into account the role of infection flow, graph connectivity, and outdegree centrality. Experimental results on many real network datasets show that the GraphShield outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms regarding both effectiveness and efficiency.},

Though easy for humans, such natural language tasks are nontrivial computationally. In this paper, we present a novel technique for sorting a corpus of news articles based on two competing semantic objectives. Solving this multi-objective optimization problem yields a pareto front with a finite set of solution articles. Iterating on the remaining data, we construct solution sets in tiers of successive pareto fronts. Our technique allows for exploration of the tradeoffs between semantic concepts, yielding cogent and trope-like results.},

We present interesting descriptive statistics about their combined 339,270 interactions, and we find that relatively simple models are able to predict users' individual browse- or vote-interactions with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {Spectral graph theory gives a useful approach to analyzing network structure based on the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix that represents the network topology and link weights. However, in large scale and complex social networks, since it is difficult to know the network topology and link weights, we cannot determine the components of these matrices directly. To solve this problem, we consider a method for indirectly determining a Laplacian matrix from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As the first step, our prior study proposed a method for estimating eigenvalues of a Laplacian matrix by using the resonance of oscillation dynamics on networks with no a priori information about the network structure, and showed the effectiveness of this method. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix by once again using the resonance of oscillation dynamics on networks.},

The psycho-sociological background of an individual plays a crucial role in determining his/her vulnerability of being lured into joining the organisation and indulge in terrorist activities, since his/her behavior largely depends on the society s/he was brought up in. Here, we analyse five sociological aspects -- personality, values &amp; ethics, optimism/pessimism, age and gender to understand the psycho-sociological vulnerability of individuals over Twitter.

In particular, for a large portion of items that there are not sufficient purchase records, their latent factors cannot be estimated accurately. In this paper, we aim to learn and exploit the preference of users in combination with the latent factor models to mitigate these issues and to improve recommendation accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm to accurately learn the preference of users from observed ratings and available taxonomy of items. We show that predictions made based on the extracted users' preferences enable to capture the taste of users and generates more effective recommendations than pure latent factor models. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first to extract and exploit the implicit preference of users in the recommendation. We conduct thorough experiments on real datasets that demonstrate the proposed model improves significantly over state-of-the-art latent factor models.},

In this paper, we propose hop-based algorithms that can easily scale to millions of nodes and billions of edges.

Does the persistent presence of some key contributors among the most productive members improve or not the quality of the knowledge, considered in the aggregate? The present paper considers these issues by correlating week-by-week value changes in contribution unevenness, elite resilience (stickiness), and content quality. The goal is to detect if and how changes in social structural variables may influence the quality of the knowledge produced by online knowledge production sites. The paper addresses such question by an extensive data analysis carried out on the datasets of two representative sites: Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. Results from the analysis show that on Stack Overflow both unevenness and elite stickiness have a curvilinear effect on quality. Quality is optimized at specific levels of elite stickiness and unevenness. At the same time, on Wikipedia, quality increases linearly with a decline on entropy, overall, and with an increase in stickiness in the maturation phase, after an entropy peak is reached.},

abstract = {Closeness centrality is one way of measuring how central a node is in the given network. The closeness centrality measure assigns a centrality value to each node based on its accessibility to the whole network. In real life applications, we are mainly interested in ranking nodes based on their centrality values. The classical method to compute the rank of a node first computes the closeness centrality of all nodes and then compares them to get its rank. Its time complexity is O(n · m + n), where n represents total number of nodes, and m represents total number of edges in the network. In the present work, we propose a heuristic method to fast estimate the closeness rank of a node in O(α · m) time complexity, where α = 3. We also propose an extended improved method using uniform sampling technique. This method better estimates the rank and it has the time complexity O(α · m), where α ≈ 10-100. This is an excellent improvement over the classical centrality ranking method. The efficiency of the proposed methods is verified on real world scale-free social networks using absolute and weighted error functions.},

abstract = {Finding information source in viral spreading has important applications such as to root out the culprit of a rumor spreading in online social networks. In particular, given a snapshot observation of the rumor graph, how to accurately identify the initial source of the spreading? In the seminal work by Shah and Zaman in 2011, this statistical inference problem was formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and solved using a rumor centrality approach for graphs that are degree-regular. This however is optimal only if there are no boundary effects, e.g., the underlying number of susceptible vertices is countably infinite. In general, all practical real world networks are finite or exhibit complex spreading behavior, and therefore these boundary effects cannot be ignored. In this paper, we solve the constrained maximum likelihood estimation problem by a generalized rumor centrality for spreading in graphs with boundary effects. We derive a graph-theoretic characterization of the maximum likelihood estimator for degree-regular graphs with a single end vertex at its boundary and propose a message-passing algorithm that is near-optimal for graphs with more complex boundary consisting of multiple end vertices.},

Most influence maximization algorithms proposed in the literature assume that ground-truth influence spread probabilities are available. In reality, however, it is natural to assume that there exists a deviation of the influence spread probability used in the influence maximization algorithms from actual influence spread probability. In this paper, we examine the robustness of existing influence maximization algorithms against non-adversarial perturbations in influence spread probabilities. Our results show that the effectiveness of state-of-the-art approximation and heuristic algorithms may be significantly degraded, and lightweight heuristic algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art algorithms when the perturbations are large.},

abstract = {Research in analysis of microblogging platforms is experiencing a renewed surge with a large number of works applying representation learning models for applications like sentiment analysis, semantic textual similarity computation, hashtag prediction, etc. Although the performance of the representation learning models has been better than the traditional baselines for such tasks, little is known about the elementary properties of a tweet encoded within these representations, or why particular representations work better for certain tasks. Our work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the black-box of vector embeddings for tweets.Traditional feature engineering methods for high-level applications have exploited various elementary properties of tweets. We believe that a tweet representation is effective for an application because it meticulously encodes the application-specific elementary properties of tweets. To understand the elementary properties encoded in a tweet representation, we evaluate the representations on the accuracy to which they can model each of those properties such as tweet length, presence of particular words, hashtags, mentions, capitalization, etc.Our systematic extensive study of nine supervised and four unsupervised tweet representations against most popular eight textual and five social elementary properties reveal that Bi-directional LSTMs (BLSTMs) and Skip-Thought Vectors (STV) best encode the textual and social properties of tweets respectively. FastText is the best model for low resource settings, providing very little degradation with reduction in embedding size. Finally, we draw interesting insights by correlating the model performance obtained for elementary property prediction tasks with the high-level downstream applications.},

abstract = {The friendship paradox states that in a social network, egos tend to have lower degree than their alters, or, "your friends have more friends than you do". Most research has focused on the friendship paradox and its implications for information transmission, but treating the network as static and unweighted. Yet, people can dedicate only a finite fraction of their attention budget to each social interaction: a high-degree individual may have less time to dedicate to individual social links, forcing them to modulate the quantities of contact made to their different social ties. Here we study the friendship paradox in the context of differing contact volumes between egos and alters, finding a connection between contact volume and the strength of the friendship paradox. The most frequently contacted alters exhibit a less pronounced friendship paradox compared with the ego, whereas less-frequently contacted alters are more likely to be high degree and give rise to the paradox. We argue therefore for a more nuanced version of the friendship paradox: "your closest friends have slightly more friends than you do", and in certain networks even: "your best friend has no more friends than you do". We demonstrate that this relationship is robust, holding in both a social media and a mobile phone dataset. These results have implications for information transfer and influence in social networks, which we explore using a simple dynamical model.},

Due to the spread of information infused into the algorithms the prediction accuracy has been shown in the literature to be different for different algorithms.Entropy based measures that are tailored for the differing situations of information availability have been successfully applied in the prediction scenarios in many fields including network traffic, human mobility and radio spectrum state dynamics as well as in atmospheric science. In this paper we adopt a multitude of entropy based measures for quantifying the predictability of cascade volumes in online social media communications. The limit derived from the entropy measures discussed in this paper has also been used to explain the difference in accuracies of some of the algorithms for cascade volume predictions reported in the literature. For the purpose of illustration and to demonstrate the utility of the entropy based predictability limits we have used two data sets, the MemeTracker dataset and Twitter Hashtags dataset. The results obtained in this paper demonstrate clearly the utility of entropy based measures for quantifying the predictability in online social media cascades. We have also shown that temporal relevancy is a dominant contributing factor in cascade predictability and how additional features such as the knowledge of a small number of large media sites and blogs can have significant influence on the prediction performance.},

abstract = {Identifying a set of diversified users who are local residents in a city is an important task for a wide spectrum of applications such as target ads of local business, surveys and interviews, and personalized recommendations. While many previous studies have investigated the problem of identifying the local users in a given area using online social network information (e.g., geotagged posts), few methods have been developed to solve the diversified user identification problem. In this paper, we propose a new analytical framework, Diversified Local Users Finder (DLUF), to accurately identify a set of diversified local users using a principled approach. In particular, the DLUF scheme first defines a new distance metric that measures the diversity between local users from physical dimension. The DLUF scheme then provides a solution to find the set of local users with maximum diversity. The performance of DLUF scheme is compared to several representative baselines using two real world datasets obtained from Foursquare application. We observe that the DLUF scheme accurately identifies the local users with a great diversity and significantly outperforms the compared baselines.},

abstract = {Social media has become an important tool for companies interested in increasing the reach of their products and services. Some companies even offer monetary incentives to customers for recommending products to their social circles. However, the effectiveness of such incentives is often hard to optimize due to the large space of incentive parameters and the inherent tradeoff between the incentive attractiveness for the customer and the return on investment for the company. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph evolution model, Me+N model, which provides flexibility in exploring the effect of different incentive parameters on company's profits by capturing the probabilistic nature of customer behavior over time. We look at a specific family of incentives in which customers get a reward if they convince a certain number of friends to purchase a given product. Our analysis shows that simple monetary incentives can be surprisingly effective in social media strategies.},

Also, the characteristics of urban areas, placeness, were identified from the lifelogs attained.Based on this concern, in this paper, we propose a new approach of placeness extraction with an ontology-based urban area placeness identification system. The suggested technique uses the textual, temporal, and spatial information of a LBS post from a specific area, and combines this information with the help of ontology. This combination measures the areas occasion-oriented placeness, which can be subdivided into time or companions. Our work focuses on a case study of Twitter data from the city of Seoul. The results show that our system is able to extract subdividable placeness and suitable correspondences when compared to real world socio-geographic features.},

abstract = {Community detection is one of the most well known problems in complex network analysis. In real-world networks, communities often overlap. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to detect overlapping communities in networks. Local Expansion and optimization approaches have gained popularity due to their scalability and robustness. In a method based on local expansion, the seeding strategy and scoring function employed are crucial to the performance of the algorithm.In this paper, a scoring function called CEIL score is used with ground-truth seeds in local expansion and optimization algorithm. Using CEIL score has significantly improved performance of the algorithms with respect to evaluation metrics NMI and F1 score. However, CEIL has lower coverage than conductance. An extension to CEIL score, called MCEIL score is proposed. Using MCEIL score returns communities with coverage as high as conductance, and NMI and F1 scores higher than conductance on different kinds of datasets.Experiments on datasets of different types with different seeding strategies show that the improvements in NMI and F1 score obtained by MCEIL score are substantial.},

abstract = {How do leaders lead? Are individuals with influence always at the front of their group? Do they initiate travel in new directions or are they first to start moving? Which attempts to initiate movement translate to leadership? In this paper we present a computational method to characterize and classify the types of leaders in movement initiation. We adapt a leadership inference framework, FLICA, to extract information about which individuals act as leaders. We then propose a framework for ranking leaders according to their position, velocity, and heading relative to the group and perform hypothesis testing of correlations between target features and leadership ranking. We use a time series of GPS positions of wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) as an application of our approach. Our results demonstrate that there is no correlation between leadership and early movement, there is negative correlation between leadership and new directions, while leadership and new area exploration are positively correlated. Thus, as an example, in baboons, our approach shows that while leaders are not the first to move, they are typically at the front and move in a new area with everybody immediately aligning in the direction of leader. Our simple scheme is flexible to be applied to other data sets and sets of traits to characterize leadership.},

abstract = {The ability of a node to relay information in a network is often measured using betweenness centrality. In order to take into account the fact that the role of the nodes vary through time, several adaptations of this concept have been proposed to time-evolving networks. However, these definitions are demanding in terms of computational cost, as they call for the computation of time-ordered paths. We propose a definition of centrality in link streams which is node-centric, in the sense that we only take into account the direct neighbors of a node to compute its centrality. This restriction allows to carry out the computation in a shorter time compared to a case where any couple of nodes in the network should be considered. Tests on empirical data show that this measure is relatively highly correlated to the number of times a node would relay information in a flooding process. We suggest that this is a good indication that this measurement can be of use in practical contexts where a node has a limited knowledge of its environment, such as routing protocols in delay tolerant networks.},

abstract = {In social network analysis, community detection is a basic step to understand the structure, function and semantics of networks. Some conventional community detection methods may have limited performance because they merely focus on topological structure of networks. In addition to topology, content information is another significant aspect of social networks. Some state-of-the-art methods started to combine these two aspects of information, but they often assume that topology and content share the same characteristics. However, for some examples of social networks, content may mismatch with topological structure. In order to better cope with such situations, we introduce a novel community detection method under the framework of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Our proposed method integrates topology and content of networks, and introduces a novel adaptive parameter for controlling the contribution of content with respect to the identified mismatch degree between the topological and content information. The case study using real social networks show that our new method can simultaneously obtain community partition and the corresponding semantic descriptions. Experiments on both artificial networks and real social networks further indicate that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting more robust behaviour when the mismatch topological and content information is observed.},

abstract = {Link prediction in social networks is a very challenging research problem. The majority of existing approaches are based on the assumption that a given network evolves following a single phenomenon, e.g. "rich get richer" or "friend of my friend is my friend". However, dynamics of network dynamic changes over time and different parts of the network evolve in different manner. Because of that, we hypothesise that the prediction accuracy can be improved by providing different treatment to different nodes and links. Building on that assumption, we propose a Community Bridge Boosting Prediction Model (CBBPM) that treats certain bridge nodes differently depending on their structural position. For such bridge nodes their similarity score obtained using traditional link-based prediction methods is boosted. By doing so the importance of these nodes is increased and at the same time ensuring that the CBBPM can be used with any existing link prediction method. Our experimental results show that such bridge node similarity boosting mechanism can improve the accuracy of traditional link prediction methods.},

In this work, we present the analysis of the layers of three terrorist multilayered networks. Based on our analysis, we categorize these layers into two types: evolving and mature. We propose generative models to create synthetic dark layers of both types. The proposed models are validated using the available datasets and results show that they can be used to generate synthetic layers having properties similar to the original networks' layers.},

In this paper, we use supervised learning, textual semantic similarity and community detection techniques to find actively discussed policy agenda sub-topics among political tweets within a certain time period. Specifically, we target tweets pertaining to major policy agendas published by state representatives in US, to try and discern the major policy sub-topics that they address using their twitter accounts. Using our method, we demonstrate how we achieve a high accuracy in terms of Topic Recall and Order Recall, by comparing the output of our proposed method with sub-topic annotations done by domain experts.},

abstract = {Communication ties afford access to valuable information and resources, but obtaining these advantages requires the effort of forming and maintaining those ties. Preserving a balance between tie benefits and tie costs is essential for members of organizations that require coordination and continuous communication to execute complex tasks. Disrupted task environments exacerbate the challenge of maintaining this balance by 1) increasing the communication load necessary for efficient task execution and 2) increasing the cognitive load necessary for any one individual to carry out his/her duties. In this paper we examine email communication within a military organization performing multifaceted, interdependent tasks prior to and during a crisis event. Using a dynamic model of the evolving communication network, we assess how structural, individual, and tie-based attributes influence one's decision to preserve or dissolve outbound ties and either enhance or degrade an individual's appeal as a communication partner. We find evidence of outbound tie dissolution, particularly among those whose roles or knowledge suggest they would have important information to share, although we also find preservation of strategically valuable ties. The discrepancy between patterns of outbound and inbound tie dissolution suggests that active and passive ties may be subject to differential pressures towards preservation or dissolution.},

abstract = {Counting small connected subgraph patterns called graphlets is emerging as a powerful tool for exploring topological structure of networks and for analysis of roles of individual nodes. Graphlets have numerous applications ranging from biology to network science. Computing graphlet counts for "dynamic graphs" is highly challenging due to the streaming nature of the input, sheer size of the graphs, and superlinear time complexity of the problem. Few practical results are known under the massive streaming graphs setting. In this work, we propose a "unified framework" to estimate the graphlet counts of the whole graph as well as the graphlet counts of individual nodes under the streaming graph setting. Our framework subsumes previous methods and provides more flexible and accurate estimation of the graphlet counts. We propose a general unbiased estimator which can be applied to any k-node graphlets. Furthermore, efficient implementation is provided for the 3, 4-node graphlets. We perform detailed empirical study on real-world graphs, and show that our framework produces estimation of graphlet count for streaming graphs with 1.7 to 170.8 times smaller error compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Our framework also achieves high accuracy on the estimation of graphlets for each individual node which previous works could not achieve.},

The proposed methods are based on the power law degree distribution characteristic or sampling techniques. We further study the efficiency and feasibility of these approaches in different contexts. The proposed methods are simulated on synthetic networks, as well as on real world social networks. Results show that the degree rank of a node can be estimated with high accuracy using only 1% samples of the network size.

abstract = {Many large datasets from a variety of fields of research can be represented as graphs. A common query is to identify the most important, or highly ranked, vertices in a graph. Centrality metrics are used to obtain numerical scores for each vertex in the graph. The scores can then be translated to rankings identifying relative importance of vertices. In this work we focus on Katz Centrality, a linear algebra based metric. In many real applications, since data is constantly being produced and changed, it is necessary to have a dynamic algorithm to update centrality scores with minimal computation when the graph changes. We present an algorithm for updating Katz Centrality scores in a dynamic graph that incrementally updates the centrality scores as the underlying graph changes. Our proposed method exploits properties of iterative solvers to obtain updated Katz scores in dynamic graphs. Our dynamic algorithm improves performance and achieves speedups of over two orders of magnitude compared to a standard static algorithm while maintaining high quality of results.},

In this paper, we introduce an expert-finding algorithm for Twitter, which can be generalized to find topical experts in any social network with endorsement features.Our approach combines traditional link analysis with text mining. It relies on crowd-sourced data from Twitter lists to build a labeled directed graph called the endorsement graph, which captures topical expertise as perceived by users. Given a text query, our algorithm uses a dynamic topic-sensitive weighting scheme, which sets the weights on the edges of the graph. Then, it uses an improved version of query-dependent PageRank to find important nodes in the graph, which correspond to topical experts. In addition, we address the scalability and performance issues posed by large social networks by pruning the input graph via a focused-crawling algorithm.Extensive evaluation on a number of different topics demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly improves on query-dependent PageRank, outperforms the current publicly-known state-of-the-art methods, and is competitive with Twitter's own search system, while using less than 0.05% of all Twitter accounts.},

abstract = {Individuals sharing data on today's social computing systems face privacy losses due to information disclosure that go much beyond the data they directly share. Indeed, it was shown that it is possible to infer additional information about a user from data shared by other users--- this type of information disclosure is called attribute disclosure. Such studies, however, were limited to a single social computing system. In reality, users have identities across several social computing systems and reveal different aspects of their lives in each. This enlarges considerably the scope of information disclosure, but also complicates its analysis. Indeed, when considering multiple social computing systems, information disclosure can be of two types: attribute disclosure or identity disclosure--- which relates to the risk of pinpointing, for a given identity in a social computing system, the identity of the same individual in another social computing system. This raises the key question: how do these two privacy risks relate to each other?In this paper, we perform the first combined study of attribute and identity disclosure risks across multiple social computing systems. We first propose a framework to quantify these risks. Our empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset from Facebook and Twitter then shows that, in some regime, there is a tradeoff between the two information disclosure risks, that is, users with a lower identity disclosure risk suffer a higher attribute disclosure risk. We investigate in depth the different parameters that impact this tradeoff.},

abstract = {Commenting platforms, such as Disqus, have emerged as a major online communication platform with millions of users and posts. Their popularity has also attracted parasitic and malicious behaviors, such as trolling and spamming. There has been relatively little research on modeling and safeguarding these platforms. As our key contribution, we develop a systematic approach to detect malicious users on commenting platforms. Our work provides two key novelties: (a) we provide a fine-grained classification of malicious behaviors, and (b) we use a comprehensive set of 73 features that span four dimensions of information. We use 7 million comments during a 9 month period, and we show that our classification methods can distinguish between benign, and malicious roles (spammers, trollers, and fanatics) with a 0.904 AUC. Our work is a solid step towards ensuring that commenting platforms are a safe and pleasant medium for the exchange of ideas.},

abstract = {Inferring trust relations between social media users is critical for a number of applications wherein users seek credible information. The fact that available trust relations are scarce and skewed makes trust prediction a challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on exploring representation learning for trust prediction. We propose an approach that uses only a small amount of binary user-user trust relations to simultaneously learn user embeddings and a model to predict trust between user pairs. We empirically demonstrate that for trust prediction, our approach outperforms classifier-based approaches which use state-of-the-art representation learning methods like DeepWalk and LINE as features. We also conduct experiments which use embeddings pre-trained with DeepWalk and LINE each as an input to our model, resulting in further performance improvement. Experiments with a dataset of ~356K user pairs show that the proposed method can obtain a high F-score of 92.65%.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous use of social media such as microblogging platforms brings about ample opportunities for the false information to diffuse online. It is very important not just to determine the veracity of information but also the authenticity of the users who spread the information, especially in time-critical situations like real-world emergencies, where urgent measures have to be taken for stopping the spread of fake information. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based approach for automatic identification of the users spreading rumorous information by leveraging the concept of believability, i.e., the extent to which the propagated information is likely to be perceived as truthful, based on the trust measures of users in Twitter's retweet network. We hypothesize that the believability between two users is proportional to the trustingness of the retweeter and the trustworthiness of the tweeter, which are two complementary measures of user trust and can be inferred from retweeting behaviors using a variant of HITS algorithm. With the retweet network edge-weighted by believability scores, we use network representation learning to generate user embeddings, which are then leveraged to classify users into as rumor spreaders or not. Based on experiments on a very large real-world rumor dataset collected from Twitter, we demonstrate that our method can effectively identify rumor spreaders and outperform four strong baselines with large margin.},

abstract = {Initialization of information spreading processes within complex networks is usually based on selection of initial nodes as a seed set. While most methods are choosing seeds in a single stage, another possible option is a partial budget usage in the first stage and spending the remaining budget while the process develops. In this paper we analyze how the ratio of seeds used in the primary and supporting stages affects the performance in terms of number of activated nodes and its duration. We have used real networks and agent based simulations with various parameters including different propagation probabilities, nodes selection strategies and number of seeds. Results show that coverage can be improved by minimizing the number of seeds used in primary seeding and increasing it in supporting seeding. Delaying the use of supporting seeds better supports natural diffusion processes and avoids selection of seeds with high potential to be activated anyway.},

abstract = {Link prediction problem in network science has experienced extensive methodological improvements and simultaneously, spawned over numerous applications. In relation to evolutionary network analysis, different dynamic link prediction methods in network science not only support the prediction of future links but also assist in modelling network dynamics. The concept of constructing dynamic similarity metrics by considering the actor-level evolution of network structure and associated neighborhoods has been widely ignored for the purpose of dynamic link prediction. This study attempts to propose two dynamic similarity metrics for the purpose of dynamic link prediction in longitudinal networks through mining evolutionary information. These metrics consider the similarity between network structural and neighborhood changes over time incident to non-connected actor pairs. These metrics are then used as dynamic features in supervised link prediction model and performances are compared against two baseline static similarity metrics (i.e., AdamicAdar and Katz). Higher performance scores achieved by these features, examined in this study, exemplifies them as prospective candidates not only for dynamic link prediction task but also in understanding the growth pattern of dynamic networks.},

abstract = {Product reviews are important information sources for consumers as they make their purchasing decisions. However, some unethical firms hire fake reviewers to generate biased positive reviews to promote their product and to damage the product reputations of their competitors. From the point of view of online product review platform providers, it is essential to keep the platform neutral and unbiased by detecting fake reviews and preventing fake reviewers from spreading biased reviews. In the current study, we attempt to use temporal and sentiment analyses as cues to separate fake reviews from authentic product reviews. Real case data of fake reviews in Taiwan was used for this temporal and sentiment analysis. Based on the analysis results, we find that fake reviewers usually generated and replied to fake reviewers during normal work hours. In contrast, ordinary users only generated and replied to a small proportion of normal product reviews during work hours. They generated and replied to normal product reviews the most during off-work hours and weekends. Additionally, the current study also revealed that more than half of fake reviewers replied others' responses to their own fake reviews no later than within one day. The research results revealed that temporal and sentiment analyses have the potential to serve as cues to detect fake reviews and fake reviewers.},

abstract = {Customer reviews provide opinions and relevant information that will affect the purchase behavior of other customers. Many studies focused on the prediction of the helpfulness of customer reviews to find the helpful reviews, which are traditionally determined by the helpful voting results. In our study, we find that the voting result of an online review is not a constant over time. Therefore, predicting the voting result based on the analysis of text is not enough; the temporal issue must be considered. We propose a system that can rank the reviews based on a set of linguistic features with a linear regression model. To evaluate our system, we collect Chinese custom reviews in eight product categories (books, digital cameras, tablet PC, backpacks, movies, men shoes, toys and cell phones) from Amazon.cn with the voting result on the helpfulness of the reviews. Since the voting result may be affected by voting time and total voting number, we define a new evaluation index and compare the regression results. The results show that the system has less prediction error when it takes the time information into the prediction model.},

abstract = {Crowdfunding platforms have known an increasing interest during the last decade. The global crowdfunding industry estimates the fundraising volume to be up to $60 Billion in 2016, surpassing traditional forms of finance. Crowdfunding by counterparts and lending have been extensively studied but, until now, only a small amount of research was focused on donation-based platforms. In this paper, we propose a first analysis of the Leetchi donation crowdfunding platform and of an impact of social network activity on project success. The project success insights covered in this article could guide the project owners into more successful decisions and strategies on social media. We collected and analyzed the Twitter activity related to Leetchi projects from November 1st to November 30th, 2016 obtaining a set of 19,000 tweets mentioning 438 Leetchi projects. We define and investigate seven social media features: the number of tweets, number of profiles, number of influencers, audience of the top influencer, the average number of followers and friends and statuses of people mentioning the projects. We also model Leetchi social media campaigns as a diffusion graph and extend our analysis with eight additional features: the order, the size, the number of connected components, the average in/out-degrees, the weighted average in/out-degrees and the density of the diffusion graph. Finally, we study the predictive power of all 15 features on the various levels of success of Leetchi projects using machine learning algorithms. We found that while traditional social media metrics allows predicting the reach of small funding (from 1€ to 100€), social network features allow better distinguish projects with a high level of funding (from 100€ to 1,000€).},

abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most important cancers in women around the world. The number of new cases of breast cancer in Taiwan has already broken the 10,000 mark each year to cause more than 2,000 unfortunate deaths. Many academic studies point out that the external environmental factor of breast cancer may be attributed to air pollution. Although there were relevant past studies on the external environment factor of breast cancer in Taiwan, but most statistical analyses had done little interactive visualization differences between air pollution indexes of counties/cities and the general trend status of breast cancer. in this study, a cross-domain integration was conducted based on air pollution and the density of cars/motorcycles in counties/cities to present it in a data visualization manner. The aim is to explore the correlation between the exposure to external environmental factor and breast cancer incidence rate in Taiwan. This involved integrating the open government data and establishing an entity-relationship model (ERD) using Power BI to visualize it, and exploring the correlation between the exposure to external environmental factor and breast cancer incidence rate in Taiwan. Supplemented by data visualization, data drilling was done on the impact of air pollution indexes in counties/cities to breast cancer, thereby providing a more effective platform for relevant institutions and the public to perform more beneficial breast cancer prevention advocacy, raising public awareness on breast cancer, and lowering the harmfulness of external environmental factor on breast cancer in the future.},

abstract = {With the rise of social networking, many consumers are willing to particulate in discussions on the social media, and to share and to express their comments for certain products. Enterprises can analyze the consumers' preferences and the strengths and weaknesses of diverse products on the market with a large number of online reviews. However, few studies have been made at applying deep learning to the sentiment analysis on word of mouth of smart bracelet in Chinese reviews. The purpose of this research is to explore the impact of online word of mouth on the consumers of smart bracelets and propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning model to the sentiment analysis on word of mouth of smart bracelets. The experiment results of sentiment analysis on word of mouth of smart bracelet show that the 89.92% accuracy based on the deep learning is significantly higher than the 70.67% on the Na\"{\i}ve Bayes algorithm and the 66.01% on the support vector machine. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we have proposed an approach with deep learning to sentiment analysis on the word of mouth of smart bracelets. The experimental results show that the proposed deep learning approach can effectively enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Second, through the text analysis, we have constructed a sentiment dictionary called iTSBSD for the word of mouth of smart bracelets in Chinese reviews on Taobao.},

abstract = {Non-participative protected areas management can generate conflicts especially between stakeholders and administrative public bodies. Involving NGOs in management activities, as representatives of citizens and stakeholders can be critical for a successful enforcement of conservation activities, contributing to a better information flow within the management network. Nevertheless, integrating NGOs in management activities coordinated by public bodies is a challenging task, mostly due the dominant top-down approach, with no shared responsibilities with other actors. To evaluate the public participation in management of Natura 2000 sites, we compare public perception data with social network analysis around administration of Iron Gates Natural Park (SW Romania) and overlapped Natura 2000 protected areas. By applying a survey in 2012 and 2016 to local people, we observed an increasing trend of awareness regarding the protected area and conservation activities carried out by the administration. However, we identified lower percentages regarding the level of participation in activities of the protected area. The social network analysis applied to management actors and relationships between them revealed a marginal position of NGOs involved in Iron Gates Natural Park management, and as well a lack of coordination of these NGOs. Our paper highlights the low level of collaboration between different types of institutions involved in environmental management. Our social network analysis results illustrate the actual collaboration relationships between stakeholders, critical findings in achieving established management objectives. Public bodies and NGOs should make progress by addressing both ecological and societal issues in the management of Natura 2000 sites, in order to ensure sustainability, raise trust and maintain long-term viability of natural and cultural heritage.},

To shift the public's focus from being on the disability to be on the abilities of the visually impaired, non-profit organizations and government agencies have conducted a series of campaigns to spread awareness about visual impairments. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, has become the primary channel to diffuse information to the public. The goal of this paper is to analyze the use of Twitter as a social media platform to spread information during visual impairments awareness campaigns.

abstract = {Online social media provide a platform for rapid network propagation of information at an unprecedented scale. In this paper, we study the evolution of information cascades in Twitter using a point process model of user activity. Twitter is rich with heterogenous information on users and network structure. We develop several Hawkes process models considering various properties of Twitter including conversational structure, users' connections and general features of users including the textual information, and show how they are helpful in modeling the social network activity. Evaluation on Twitter data sets shows that incorporating richer properties improves the performance in predicting future activity of users and memes.},

abstract = {The study of information flow typically does not distinguish the choices of tie strength on which the information flows. All receivers of the information are assumed to have the same potential to pass on the information. Modifying the SEIZ (susceptible, exposed, infected, skeptic) model, we discover that people choose to retweet strong or weak ties based on the topic. We made two modifications in the model. In the first modification (Model I), we assume that the contact rates of agents in different compartment and the probability of an agent transitioning from one compartment to another are different for strong ties and weak ties. In the second modification (Model II), we assume that only the probability of transitioning is different for strong ties and weak ties. We discover that people do not discriminate strong ties and weak ties when retweeting controversial topic, perhaps because this topic can both be personal and breaking news. On the other hand, people discriminate strong ties and weak ties when retweeting non-controversial topic. They prefer to retweet strong ties when the topic is donation, and kids, and weak ties when the topic is news on hurricane and music. Meanwhile, SEIZ model and its modifications are found to be inadequate to model tweets on event promotion.},

This problem is exacerbated in the context of SM, where the amount of data in a single message can be extremely small, like in Twitter. Firstly, in this paper we investigate whether SM do applies watermarks on the texts. Then, we propose a text watermarking method able to work on all the SM platforms considered, while ensuring visual indistinguishability and length preservation of the original text and robustness to copy and paste. We conduct an extended evaluation on eighteen different SM platforms by using 6,000 posts from six public figures' profiles.},

abstract = {Sampling social graphs is critical for studying things like information diffusion. However, it is often necessary to laboriously obtain unbiased and well-connected datasets because existing survey algorithms are unable to generate well-connected samples, and current random-walk based unbiased sampling algorithms adopt rejection sampling, which heavily undermines performance. This paper proposes a novel random-walk based algorithm which implements Unbiased Sampling using Dummy Edges (USDE). It injects dummy edges between nodes, on which the walkers would otherwise experience excessive rejections before moving out from such nodes. We propose a rejection probability estimation algorithm to facilitate the construction of dummy edges and the computation of moving probabilities. Finally, we apply USDE in two real-life social media: Twitter and Sina Weibo. The results demonstrate that USDE generates well-connected samples, and outperforms existing approaches in terms of sampling efficiency and quality of samples.},

Researchers devote time and effort to search relevant manuscripts when writing a paper or simply to keep up with current research. In this paper, we consider the problem of citation recommendation by extending a set of known-to-be-relevant references. Our analysis shows the degrees of cited papers in the subgraph induced by the citations of a paper, called projection graph, follow a power law distribution. Existing popular methods are only good at finding the long tail papers, the ones that are highly connected to others. In other words, the majority of cited papers are loosely connected in the projection graph but they are not going to be found by existing methods. To address this problem, we propose to combine author, venue and keyword information to interpret the citation behavior behind those loosely connected papers. Results show that different methods are finding cited papers with widely different properties. We suggest multiple recommended lists by different algorithms could satisfy various users for a real citation recommendation system.},

abstract = {Social networks are important communication and information media. Individuals in a social network share information and influence each other through their social connections. Understanding social influence and information diffusion is a fundamental research endeavor and it has important applications in online social advertising and viral marketing.In this work, we introduce the Targeted-Influence problem (TIP): Given a network G = (V, ε) and a model of influence, we want to be able to estimate in real-time (e.g. a few seconds per query) the influence of a subset of users S over another subset of users T, for any possible query (S; T), S, T ⊆ V. To do so, we allow an efficient preprocessing.We provide the first scalable real-time algorithm for TIP. Our algorithm requires \~{O}(|V| + |ε|) space and preprocessing time, and it provides a provable approximation of the influence of S over T, for every subsets of nodes S, T ⊆ V in the query with large enough influence. The running time for answering each query (a.k.a query stage) is theoretically guaranteed to be \~{O}(|S| + |T|) in general undirected and for directed graphs under certain assumptions, supported by experiments.We also introduce the Snapshot model as our model of influence, which extends and includes as special case both the Independent Cascade and the Linear Threshold models. The analysis and the theoretical guarantees of our algorithms hold under the more general Snapshot model. Finally, we perform an extensive experimental analysis, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of our methods.},

In this paper, we analyze 1.67 million Facebook posts created by 153 media organizations to understand the extent of clickbait practice, its impact and user engagement by using our own developed clickbait detection model. The model uses distributed sub-word embeddings learned from a large corpus. The accuracy of the model is 98.3%.

In this paper we propose to use crowd sourcing for information retrieval in a DSN. We analyze a popular information retrieval problem called expert search in a social network. In this paper, we present an algorithm for such a crowd sourcing based search process which includes solution for (a) the worker selection problem (b) the task selection problem and (c) the reward distribution problem.

Another important aspect is their creation-death nature, since their duration depends on the users needs. They are created when required and died when no longer used. In this article we present SOPPIA, an educational sporadic network that provides social learning and self-learning services. Social learning occurs through the creation of sporadic work groups, following the nature of SLNs; while self-learning is achieved through individual activities recommendation and the use of personalized virtual machines.},

abstract = {Quantifying scientific productivity has traditionally been one of the major areas of research. An important component in measuring the scientific productivity of a researcher has been the number and citation count of his publications. However, that citation based measures of scientific productivity are influenced by domain specific factors like the popularity of the research domain, the key topics within the domain, as well as temporal factors like aging, these measures may not suitably reflect the contribution of a researcher uniformly across all domains. In this paper, we introduce social trust on a researcher in a given domain as a measure of his scientific productivity and success. We argue that trust in scientific domain is a social component that indicates the productivity and can influence several parameters like the collaborations of the researchers as well as the citations received by their publications. Unlike citation count of publications, trust is not domain specific and hence can be used uniformly across all domains to measure the scientific productivity.Our proposed measure of trust relies on a trust-based network of authors (nodes), where a link between two nodes is based on social indicators like co-authorship and citation counts. We validate the correctness as well as effectiveness of our proposed approach empirically using the ArnetMiner dataset. Observations indicate that the proposed measure not only mitigates the aging issues prevalent in citation based measures but can also predict the possibility of future success of the researchers in terms of citation count.},

abstract = {Because of the explosive growth of Android malware and due to the severity of its damages, the detection of Android malware has become an increasing important topic in cybersecurity. Currently, the major defense against Android malware is commercial mobile security products which mainly use signature-based method for detection. However, attackers can easily devise methods, such as obfuscation and repackaging, to evade the detection, which calls for new defensive techniques that are harder to evade. In this paper, resting on the analysis of Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the smali files, we further categorize the API calls which belong to the some method in the smali code into a block. Based on the generated API call blocks, we then explore deep neural networks (i.e., Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs)) for newly unknown Android malware detection. Using a real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center, a comprehensive experimental study is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that (1) our proposed feature extraction method (i.e., using API call blocks) outperforms using API calls directly in Android malware detection; (2) DBN works better than SAEs in this application; and (3) the detection performance of deep neural networks is better than shallow learning architectures.},

This paper examines the lifetime of malware download sites in terms of their URLs and FQDNs. We measured approximately 18,000 malware download URLs, for half a year, by using our Internet surveillance systems, we found that malware download sites have larger lifetime than exploit sites. We defined the malicious FQDN score and thereby analyzed top-scoring FQDN, time series, score distributions, and VirusTotals. We also analyzed the relationships among FQDN, malware, registrar, and name server. Our analytical results are useful in deciding appropriate methods or periods for blacklisting malware download sites.},

abstract = {In recent years, community detection has drawn more and more researchers' attention. With the development of Internet, the scale of network data is growing fast. It is necessary to find an effective parallel community detection algorithm for large-scale network. In this paper, we propose a novel and parallel community detection algorithm, PCDU algorithm, based on distance dynamics. We send distances information to nodes and update distances of edges constantly, based on previous values and the unified model, which is introduced to quantify different influences from nodes and edges. It ends until the distances are stable. Then we remove some special edges from the original graph and get all subgraphs, which are the community partitions. It still inherits the advantage of uncovering small communities and outliers. Experiments based on synthetic networks and real world networks, show that our algorithm execute more efficient than stand-alone version. Since it is based on the Spark platform and designed in parallelization, the algorithm is very suitable for large datasets. We also provide a novel method taking use of double summation to calculate the NMI value of community partition result and the embedded community structure. Compared with the traditional way, it is not only as accurate as the traditional way and more efficient, but also has less space complexity. Experiments show that it is suitable for evaluating community division results in large-scale network.},

abstract = {Classification is one of the most studied subjects in machine learning. Most classification methods that were developed this last decade either account for structure (interactions, relationships) or attributes (text, numerical, etc). This leads to ignoring significant patterns in a dataset that could only be captured by analyzing the features of an item and its interactions. Collective classification methods use both structure and attributes, often by aggregating data from neighbors of a node and learning a model on the aggregated data. In social networks, the degree distribution of nodes follows a power law where few nodes have many neighbors. High degree nodes have incoming links from low degree nodes of different classes and many nodes have very few edges. Hence, using only local structure may lead to poor predictions. Also, many social networks allow for different types of interactions (retweet, reply, like, etc.) that affect classification differently. This article proposes a collective classification method that makes use of the structure of a network to determine its neighbors. It then presents experiments aimed at detecting jihadi propagandists and malware distributors on social networks.},

abstract = {In Crowdfunding platforms, people turn their prototype ideas into real products by raising money from the crowd, or invest in someone else's projects. In reward-based crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, selecting accurate reward delivery duration becomes crucial for creators, backers, and platform providers to keep the trust between the creators and the backers, and the trust between the platform providers and users. According to Kickstarter, 35% backers did not receive rewards on time. Unfortunately, little is known about on-time and late reward delivery projects, and there is no prior work to estimate reward delivery duration. To fill the gap, in this paper, we (i) extract novel features that reveal latent difficulty levels of project rewards; (ii) build predictive models to identify whether a creator will deliver all rewards in a project on time or not; and (iii) build a regression model to estimate accurate reward delivery duration (i.e., how long it will take to produce and deliver all the rewards). Experimental results show that our models achieve good performance -- 82.5% accuracy, 78.1 RMSE, and 0.108 NRMSE at the first 5% of the longest reward delivery duration.},

abstract = {We present WALKLETS, a novel approach for learning multiscale representations of vertices in a network. In contrast to previous works, these representations explicitly encode multi-scale vertex relationships in a way that is analytically derivable.WALKLETS generates these multiscale relationships by sub-sampling short random walks on the vertices of a graph. By 'skipping' over steps in each random walk, our method generates a corpus of vertex pairs which are reachable via paths of a fixed length. This corpus can then be used to learn a series of latent representations, each of which captures successively higher order relationships from the adjacency matrix.We demonstrate the efficacy of WALKLETS's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, DBLP, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that WALKLETS outperforms new methods based on neural matrix factorization. Specifically, we outperform DeepWalk by up to 10% and LINE by 58% Micro-F1 on challenging multi-label classification tasks. Finally, WALKLETS is an online algorithm, and can easily scale to graphs with millions of vertices and edges.},

abstract = {Modularity for multilayer networks, also called multislice modularity, is parametric to a resolution factor and an inter-layer coupling factor. The former is useful to express layer-specific relevance and the latter quantifies the strength of node linkage across the layers of a network. However, such parameters can be set arbitrarily, thus discarding any structure information at graph or community level. Other issues are related to the inability of properly modeling order relations over the layers, which is required for dynamic networks.In this paper we propose a new definition of modularity for multilayer networks that aims to overcome major issues of existing multislice modularity. We revise the role and semantics of the layer-specific resolution and inter-layer coupling terms, and define parameter-free unsupervised approaches for their computation, by using information from the within-layer and inter-layer structures of the communities. Moreover, our formulation of multilayer modularity is general enough to account for an available ordering of the layers and relating constraints on layer coupling. Experimental evaluation was conducted using three state-of-the-art methods for multilayer community detection and nine real-world multilayer networks. Results have shown the significance of our modularity, disclosing the effects of different combinations of the resolution and inter-layer coupling functions. This work can pave the way for the development of new optimization methods for discovering community structures in multilayer networks.},

Gaining understanding of the influence of Twitter in state politics in the United States cannot be achieved without proper computational tools. We present the first attempt to automatically classify tweets of state legislatures (policy makers at the state level) into major policy agenda topics defined by Policy Agendas Project (PAP), which was initiated to group national policies. We investigated the effectiveness of three popular machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). We proposed a new synthetic data augmentation method to further improve classification performance. Our experimental results show that CNN provides the best F1 score of 78.3%. The new data augmentation method improves the classification perfromance by about 2%. Our tool provides a good prediction of the top three popular PAP topics in each month, which is useful for tracking popular PAP topics over time and across states and for comparing with national policy agendas.},

We denote these patterns by principal patterns of the given graph since they can be regarded as its composition elements, which can be a signature for summarizing a graph of various sizes. Note that different principal patterns can contribute different sizes of graph coverage so they are not necessarily the frequent patterns. In this paper, we show that the recursive method can obtain the optimal solution while the greedy algorithms can find approximations with lower time complexity. Furthermore, we propose an effective pruning method that can be combined with both algorithms such that the mining process is even more efficient and scalable. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently and effectively discover the principal patterns.},

abstract = {Reposting is the basic and key behavior for information diffusion in online social networks. It would be beneficial to understand the influence factors of reposting behavior and predict future reposting status, which could be practically applied in breaking news detection, marketing, social media researches and so on. Existing reposting analytics and prediction approaches mainly focus on factors related to the original information content and the social influence of the information publishers. However, online information diffuses by viral cascades instead of single-source broadcast in social network, which means some reposting behavior actually occurs in information propagators rather than the original publishers. In some social networks, users are allowed to comment when they repost, which represents their views and attitudes to the information they propagate. In this paper, we evaluate how emotional tendencies of information propagators influence future reposting. We first propose a modified sentiment analysis method and present emotional analysis on the user-generated content in online diffusion. Experiments are conducted with a real-world dataset and the results indicate the effectiveness of our fine-grained emotional features in reposting prediction.},

abstract = {Quantifying the dynamics of collective human decision making is essential to optimizing communication systems, transportation networks, and action protocols for ensuring public safety in uncertain and risky situations. Representing human factors has been elusive since decision making is driven by a host of interacting factors such as time pressure, perceived risks, and social influence. We develop two complementary data-driven models to describe decision making in natural disaster scenarios based upon the observed behavior of subjects in a controlled behavioral experiment where participants must decide whether and when to evacuate from a virtual natural disaster. We first develop a rate-based model that quantifies an individual's decision-making strategy as a function of the reported disaster threat level, which we observe to be a primary influence of collective behavior, and use this model to simulate and predict evacuation at the population level. We investigate the effect of social influence on strategy adjustments that emerge in group contexts, comparing evacuation decisions made individually with those that are arrived at via group consensus or vote. We find that the accurate characterization of group behavior mandates the consideration of individual heterogeneity, leading to a second approach using an artificial neural network which incorporates more experimental parameters, including a measure of individual variation, to predict precise evacuation times. An alternative method of quantifying individual differences in the neural network uses participants' social media data as input to the model and achieves comparable prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Many graph datasets originating from online social network, financial or biological sources are too large to store or analyze. The analysis of such networks may be made more tractable if they are reduced to smaller subgraphs via sampling. While most of the known graph sampling methods are designed with static graphs in mind, many real datasets are massive and rapidly growing, making streaming methods necessary. We present two new techniques, Randomly Induced Edge Sampling (RIES) and Weighted Edge Sampling (WES). Both methods sample a stream of edges in a single pass, without the need to know future properties of the stream. In contrast to previous work that focused on limiting only the number of vertices, our methods restrict the number of edges, thus truly limiting the size of the sampled subgraph. We compare the performance of RIES and WES against the previously known streaming Random Edge (RE) method on eight social network datasets. Using four structural graph properties, we find that both RIES and WES produce subgraphs that are more structurally similar to the original graph than are the subgraphs produced by streaming RE. We also examine the sensitivity of the two algorithms with respect to their parameters. The parameters of WES affect its performance in a more predictable manner and are easier to set. Both new algorithms represent an improvement in the available streaming graph analysis toolkit.},

The new propagation rule allows MCDA to automatically unfold the hidden communities in a multidimensional context. The detected communities are further processed for relevant dimensions selection using an inter-class inertia-based procedure. The proposed algorithm is fully automated and does not require any parameter to be set by the user to recover communities and their associated dimensions.},

Many security initiatives and commercial entities are harnessing the readily public information, but they seem to focus on structured sources of information. Our goal here is to extract information from hacker forums, whose information is provided in ad hoc and unstructured ways. Here, we focus on the problem of identifying malicious IPs addresses, when these are being reported in the forums. We develop a method to automate the identification of malicious IPs with the design goal of being independent of external sources. A key novelty is that we use a matrix decomposition method to extract latent features of the behavioral information of the users, which we combine with textual information from the related posts. As key design feature, our technique can be applied to different language forums since it relies on a simple NLP solution in combination with behavioral features. In particular, our solution only needs a small number of keywords in the new language plus the user's behavior captured by specific features. We also develop a tool to automate the data collection from security forums. We collect approximately 600K posts from 3 different forums. Our method exhibits high classification accuracy, while the precision of identifying malicious IP in post is greater than 88% in all three sites. Furthermore, by applying our method, we find up to 3 times more potentially malicious IPs than compared to the reference blacklist VirusTotal. As the cyber-wars are becoming more intense, having early accesses to useful information becomes more imperative to remove the hackers first-move advantage, and our work is a solid step towards this direction.},

abstract = {Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in social network analysis, the goal of which is to group vertices of a graph into a series of densely knitted clusters with each cluster well separated from all the others. Classical graph clustering methods take advantage of the graph topology to model and quantify vertex proximity. With the proliferation of rich graph contents, such as user profiles in social networks, and gene annotations in protein interaction networks, it is essential to consider both the structure and content information of graphs for high-quality graph clustering. In this paper, we propose a graph embedding approach to clustering content-enriched graphs. The key idea is to embed each vertex of a graph into a continuous vector space where the localized structural and attributive information of vertices can be encoded in a unified, latent representation. Specifically, we quantify vertex-wise attribute proximity into edge weights, and employ truncated, attribute-aware random walks to learn the latent representations for vertices. We evaluate our attribute-aware graph embedding method in real-world attributed graphs, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Social networks are structures that are used to model complex networks in different environments. The desire of reaching useful information by studying complex networks has made social network analysis an important research topic today. One of the most interesting subjects of social network analysis is link prediction. It estimates potential future connections by using the current state of the network. In this study, link prediction is made in bipartite graphs which is one of the social network structures. For this study, the network is first constructed with question and advise (generally disease) made on online health forum sites. Online health forum is a place where user can get his/her medical questions answered by real health professionals and other forum members. Then, symptoms of diseases are obtained by analyzing questions on online forum sites. Thus, a bipartite network consisting of questions and diseases corresponding to the obtained symptom data is constructed. In this network, link prediction has been made with internal links method. The results of the method have been compared with four of the other link prediction methods and it was found that this method has better performance than the other methods.},

abstract = {According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, more than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain related to diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. Adoption of pain medications and safe healthcare practices is a major global policy concern. This adoption process is highly influenced by the interpersonal network of physicians prescribing medications to treat pain. However, existing research into physician networks have been hospital-specific, applied to a smaller number of physicians, and dependent upon physicians' self-reports. In this paper, using big-data and data-mining, we overcome these limitations: By using a case of 30+ hospitals spanning across 2000+ physicians, we create a social network containing physicians' prescription data and adoption behavior of pain medications. The social network assumes that connected physicians work in the same hospital and belong to the same specialty or specialty group. Then, using the centrality measures, degree and eigenvector centrality, we analyze prescription volumes and proportion of adopters of pain medications. We also analyze gender effects. Results revealed that the most influential physicians were not the high-volume prescribers. Male physicians were more influential compared to female physicians; however, females prescribed more volume compared to males. Our results help us identify critical physicians from certain core specialties and specialty groups who may be approached by patients seeking pain relief.},

abstract = {The goal of the present study is to analyze the evolution of friendship network and body mass index (BMI) for adolescents in 3 different types of class---boy only, girl only, and boy and girl mixed. Complicated network surveys were administrated in classrooms on several high schools in Southern Taiwan. The participants are the students who attend these three types of class. Sociometric data were collected by having each student nominate up to 16 intimate classmates. Panel data was collected 7 times across 2 school semesters from Sep. 2008 to Jun. 2009. The program for dynamic social network analysis, SIENA, was applied to estimate the models for the evolution of adolescent's friendship networks and BMI. The result showed that BMI has effect on girls' class, but not boys'. In brief, the different composition of gender in a class will construct social norm about BMI and exerts different effect on network evolution. It is helpful for intervention plan focused on norms.

abstract = {Chronic diseases such as heart and blood vessels are considered among the most common and serious reasons of mortality in the world. In Europe alone, over four million deaths a year (45% of all deaths) are caused by heart diseases [1]. In addition, chronic diseases are responsible for 70 % of United States deaths, and account for more than 75% of annual United States medical care cost [2]. For instance, Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) are considered the main cause for around 14.3% of total deaths in Denmark5, and it is the main cause for over 45% of the total death in Lebanon6. It is too costly to keep CVD patients under control locally within the vicinity of a healthcare unit. Thus, researchers recently started to realize the need for automated monitoring in health systems that are expected to reduce the overall death rate and cost associated with monitoring of patients. However, a general monitoring health system will not cover all diseases at once. Therefore, there is a pushing necessity for monitoring health systems which are dedicated to specific health cases. To contribute to the ongoing efforts, this work develops an automated system which could be customized for various chronic diseases. A mobile application based solution is proposed. Further, the work concentrates on CVD by conducting a survey in Lebanon to investigate the acceptance and awareness of ECG for remote monitoring of patients. The results are promising and reflect how specialists are aware of the need to utilize the rapid development in technology combined with the widespread usage of mobile phone which may be used as the main device to guarantee 24/7 communication link for ECG. Adopting ECG in the healthcare system will allow for capturing some valuable data which could guide the development of a recommendation system. This will issue necessary alerts to specialists and guidance to patients and their careers so that specialists could attend to the case on timely basis and patients with their careers could follow the recommendations to keep the case under control until the specialist becomes available. Finally, a secure forum based communication system will be developed to allow patients to share their experience and specialists to provide consultancy and guidance on demand.},

abstract = {A Bayesian Network (BN) is a popular framework for causal studies. Causal relationships and interactions can be captured in the topology of a BN, creating a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN). This framework enables us to reason under uncertainty and capture the strength of causal links as conditional probabilities. However, there currently is no quick and efficient way to utilize the causal knowledge contained within a CBN, once it has been learned from data. In this paper we will examine a novel, conceptual approach that uses a modular ontology to store the probabilistic relationships among variables contained within a CBN. We will demonstrate this conceptual approach for patients of depression. This will be done by learning CBN structures from pre-existing National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) study on Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) patient dataset. Once we have a CBN, we will capture and standardize the patient variables in a modular ontology based on the structure and definitions found in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA).},

abstract = {Despite clinical trials by pharmaceutical companies as well as current FDA reporting systems, there are still drug side effects that have not been caught. To find a larger sample of reports, a possible way is to mine online social media. With its current widespread use, social media such as Twitter has given rise to massive amounts of data, which can be used as reports for drug side effects. To process these large datasets, Apache Spark has become popular for fast, distributed batch processing. In this work, we have improved on previous pipelines in sentimental analysis-based mining, processing, and extracting tweets with drug-caused side effects. We have also added a new ensemble classifier using a combination of sentiment analysis features to increase the accuracy of identifying drug-caused side effects. In addition, the frequency count for the side effects is also provided. Furthermore, we have also implemented the same pipeline in Apache Spark to improve the speed of processing of tweets by 2.5 times, as well as to support the process of large tweet datasets. As the frequency count of drug side effects opens a wide door for further analysis, we present a preliminary study on this issue, including the side effects of simultaneously using two drugs, and the potential danger of using less-common combination of drugs. We believe the pipeline design and the results present in this work would have great implication on studying drug side effects and on big data analysis in general.},

abstract = {Link analysis method in general and Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm in particular is used for analyzing graph in many important contexts, including ranking search results based on the hyperlink structure of the World Wide Web and privacy analysis of social networks with the purpose of identifying the role of each object (node) of graph by computing node weight. Similar to almost link analysis algorithms, HITS method consider all edges identically in each computation. However, we find that value of edges in real cases are not identical in analyzing and depend on the relationships/associations in content of two endings. Therefore, in HITS, edge weight should be also computed so that be suitable with value of corresponding relationship/association. Benefiting from the edge weighting, we can treat the problems of "invaluable edges" and their relevant nodes (normally as "rubbishes") in analysis. With this motivation, an improvement HITS (E-HITS) is proposed in this paper. In proposed method, we analyze the meaning of edge, corresponding relationship/association and its characteristics (especially as "group-based") as basis for edge-weight calculation, in which, the calculation is only based on the available hub and authority parameters on graph. Experiments on simulation graphs as well as on real web-graph data show evidently that along with edge weighting, our proposed method can remove the impacts of invaluable edges as well as rubbish nodes in analysis, give the result more positively and objectively than the original HITS method.},

In this study, we propose social overloaded posts detection model (SODM) by deploying the latest text mining and deep learning techniques to detect the social overloaded posts and, then with the developed social overload prevention system (SOS), the social overload posts and non-social overload ones are rearranged with different sorting methods to prevent readers from excessive demands of social support or social overload. The empirical results show that our SOS helps readers to alleviate social overload when reading via social media.},

However, product owners often provide incentives (e.g. coupons, bonus points, referral rewards) to the writers, motivating the writing of biased reviews. These biased reviews, while beneficial for both writers and product owners, pollute the review space and destroy readers' trust significantly. In this paper, we analyze incentivized reviews in the Google Play store and identify a wide range of anomalous review types such as copying, spamming, advertising, and hidden-beneficiary reviews. We also find an increasing trend in the number of apps being targeted by abusers, which, if continued, will render review systems as crowd advertising platforms rather than an unbiased source of helpful information.},

abstract = {Global events such as terrorist attacks are commented upon in social media, such as Twitter, in different languages and from different parts of the world. Most prior studies have focused on monolingual sentiment analysis, and therefore excluded an extensive proportion of the Twitter userbase. In this paper, we perform a multilingual comparative sentiment analysis study on the terrorist attack in Paris, during November 2015. In particular, we look at targeted sentiment, investigating opinions on specific entities, not simply the general sentiment of each tweet. Given the potentially inflammatory and polarizing effect that these types of tweets may have on attitudes, we examine the sentiments expressed about different targets and explore whether disproportionate reaction was expressed about such targets across different languages. Specifically, we assess whether the sentiment for French speaking Twitter users during the Paris attack differs from English-speaking ones. We identify disproportionately negative attitudes in the English dataset over the French one towards some entities and, via a crowdsourcing experiment, illustrate that this also extends to forming an annotator bias.},

For each of the 4.4 million tweets, we first extracted sentiment scores based on the eight basic emotions according to Plutchik's wheel of emotions. Subsequently, we investigated the effects of shifts in the emotional valence on the spread of information. We found that in general OSN users tend to conform to the emotional valence of the respective real-world event. However, we also found empirical evidence that prospectively negative real-world events exhibit a significant amount of shifted emotions in the corresponding tweets (i.e. positive messages). To explain this finding, we use the theory of social connection and emotional contagion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides empirical evidence for the undoing hypothesis in online social networks (OSNs). The undoing hypothesis postulates that positive emotions serve as an antidote during negative events.},

We deployed this app for over a period of three months and collected a large amount of useful user data. We describe the details of this data in terms of statistics and user behaviors, provide a detailed analysis in terms of correlations between user emotions and other features, and finally build classifiers to predict user emotions. Performance of these classifiers is quite promising with high accuracy. We describe the details of these classifiers along with the results.},

abstract = {Given the set of social interactions of a user, how can we detect changes in interaction patterns over time? While most previous work has focused on studying network-wide properties and spotting outlier users, the dynamics of individual user interactions remain largely unexplored. This work sets out to explore those dynamics in a way that is minimally invasive to privacy, thus, avoids to rely on the textual content of user posts---except for validation. Our contributions are two-fold. First, in contrast to previous studies, we challenge the use of a fixed interval of observation. We introduce and empirically validate the "Temporal Asymmetry Hypothesis", which states that appropriate observation intervals should vary both among users and over time for the same user. We validate this hypothesis using eight different datasets, including email, messaging, and social networks data. Second, we propose iNET, a comprehensive analytic and visualization framework which provides personalized insights into user behavior and operates in a streaming fashion. iNET learns personalized baseline behaviors of users and uses them to identify events that signify changes in user behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of iNET by analyzing more than half a million interactions from Facebook users. Labeling of the identified changes in user behavior showed that iNET is able to capture a wide spectrum of exogenous and endogenous events, while the baselines are less diverse in nature and capture only 66% of that spectrum. Furthermore, iNET exhibited the highest precision (95%) compared to all competing approaches.},

abstract = {Both politicians and citizens are increasingly embracing social media as a means to disseminate information and comment on various topics, particularly during significant political events, such as elections. Such commentary during elections is also of interest to social scientists and pollsters. To facilitate the study of social media during elections, there is a need to automatically identify posts that are topically related to those elections. However, current studies have focused on elections within English-speaking regions, and hence the resultant election content classifiers are only applicable for elections in countries where the predominant language is English. On the other hand, as social media is becoming more prevalent worldwide, there is an increasing need for election classifiers that can be generalised across different languages, without building a training dataset for each election. In this paper, based upon transfer learning, we study the development of effective and reusable election classifiers for use on social media across multiple languages. We combine transfer learning with different classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which make use of word embedding representations for each social media post. We generalise the learned classifier models for cross-language classification by using a linear translation approach to map the word embedding vectors from one language into another. Experiments conducted over two election datasets in different languages show that without using any training data from the target language, linear translations outperform a classical transfer learning approach, namely Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), by 80% in recall and 25% in F1 measure.},

Using a human annotation task we assign 'bot' and 'human' ground-truth labels to the dataset, and compare the annotations against an online bot detection tool for evaluation. We then ask a series of questions to discern important behavioural characteristics of bots and humans using metrics within and among four popularity groups. From the comparative analysis we draw differences and interesting similarities between the two entities, thus paving the way for reliable classification of bots, and studying automated political infiltration and advertisement campaigns.},

abstract = {In this work, we look at problems of urban sensing from the lens of conversations (tweets) on Twitter. Using techniques from statistical natural language processing on geotagged tweets, we identify areas which exhibit similar aggregate behavior, infer the land-use of areas and predict types of individual establishments. We demonstrate our inferences using over two years of Twitter data, for a wide variety of spatial contexts and evaluate our results against existing open data sets. Our results are novel in extremely detailed resolution of their mapping, and demonstrate that tweets can be a very effective urban sensor and in many regards are superior to other data sources for studying urban spaces. Our techniques are language agnostic, and can be applied to any city where enough similar data is available.},

abstract = {Retweeting/sharing action has enabled information to be cascaded to distant nodes on social network. Unfortunately, malicious users as a group have taken advantage of the retweeting function with coordinated behavior to falsely distort the volume of specific keywords, topics or URLs for promotional purposes (e.g., spreading fake news, and increasing public visibility of products or services). Unfortunately, little is known about their retweeting behavior as a group and how to detect them based on group-based signals. To fill the gap, in this paper, we (i) propose Attractor+ algorithm to extract retweeter groups, members of each of which have similar retweeting behavior; (ii) analyze underlying characteristics of malicious and legitimate retweeter groups; (iii) propose group-based features to catch synchronized and coordinated behavior; and build a predictor to classify if a group is malicious. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperformed existing approaches.},

We tackle the issue of activity prediction in link streams, that is to say predicting the number of links occurring during a given period of time and we present a protocol that takes advantage of the temporal and structural information contained in the link stream. We introduce a way to represent the information captured using different features and combine them in a prediction function which is used to evaluate the future activity of links.},

abstract = {The existing literature has explored various latent attributes of Twitter users. It is worth noting that user classification research in the context of gender or the political domain is mostly binary in nature such as male-female or Republican-Democrat. Conversely, in multi-team contexts user classification is a not a binary task. Also, prior studies have mostly ignored tweets which mention more than one orientation (i.e. both Republican and Democrat-related keywords) within a tweet. We consider these tweets as mix tweets. We investigate the relationship between user classification (in a multi-team context) and user-level mix tweeting pattern. To test our proposed model, we have extracted 3.5 million tweets during the Cricket World Cup 2015 (CWC'15), in which 14 cricket-playing nations participated. We employed a logistic regression model, and our empirical evidence strongly confirms our hypothesis.},

abstract = {Predicting the future impacts of scientists and their publications is an important task for future scientific studies. Studies predicting scientific effects in the academia are mostly based on estimating citation numbers of publications. However, there are few studies focusing on predicting the impact of scientists. Determining the potential influence of scientists is useful for future scientific studies and organizations. In this respect, we propose a new approach for predicting future impacts of scientists by considering the number of citations that each scientist individually has. A great number of studies predicting citation count of publications use content based information such as title, abstract and keywords of publication, institution of scientists, journal impact factor of publisher, etc. and they don't benefit from graph structures in citation networks. However, citations among scientific publications create more complex networks which have the potential for mining scientific impacts. So, we formulated the problem of predicting future citation counts of a given scientist, as a link prediction problem for directed, weighted and dynamic citation networks. The proposed link prediction method is able to predict links and its weights. Firstly, we introduce a dynamic metric based on increasing and decreasing trends during transitions time frames in citation networks. Then, we use the introduced dynamic proximity metric with some simple topological features in classifiers to predict citation count. Experiments are conducted on 12 sampled datasets which are extracted from two citation networks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs well when considering the problem of prediction links with its weights is firstly addressed in the context of link prediction problem in directed, weighted and dynamic networks.},

abstract = {In recent years, social networks that only organize events have begun to appear and millions of people have registered for these groups online and received online invitations for events. Contrary to other social networks, at the end of the process in the event social networks, people participate in an event/a meeting physically. Even though hundreds of events occurring in the city we live are listed in the event social networks, it is not easy to follow all of the event announcements regularly, find the time and the content of the events and the events which acquaintances participate in. This study suggests a new link prediction method for the Meetup social network, which recommends events to users according to the events they participated in and their field of interests. Meetup is a significant network used in finding events. With this method, appropriate solutions are tried to be found on bipartite networks. The proposed method was tested with a dataset of 100.000 users acquired from Meetup and successful results were obtained.},

abstract = {Attributed graphs model real networks by enriching their nodes with attributes accounting for properties. Several techniques have been proposed for partitioning these graphs into clusters that are homogeneous with respect to both semantic attributes and to the structure of the graph. However, time and space complexities of state of the art algorithms limit their scalability to medium-sized graphs. We propose SToC (for Semantic-Topological Clustering), a fast and scalable algorithm for partitioning large attributed graphs. The approach is robust, being compatible both with categorical and with quantitative attributes, and it is tailorable, allowing the user to weight the semantic and topological components. Further, the approach does not require the user to guess in advance the number of clusters. SToC relies on well known approximation techniques such as bottom-k sketches, traditional graph-theoretic concepts, and a new perspective on the composition of heterogeneous distance measures. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to efficiently compute high-quality partitions of large scale attributed graphs.},

Further, we propose multiple neural network based architectures to extract useful features from these posts using pre-trained word embeddings. Our experiments on thousands of blogs and tweets show that the proposed approach results in 7% and 5% gain in F-measure over manual feature engineering based approach for blogs and tweets respectively.},

abstract = {Community detection is a well-studied problem in social networks. However most of the research so far has been on static networks. In this paper, we address the problem of community detection in evolving social networks. As social networks evolve, the community structure of the network can change. How can the community structure be updated in an efficient way? How often should community structure be updated? We give two methods based on the Louvain algorithm, to determine when to update the community structure. The first method, called the Edge-Distribution-Analysis algorithm, analyzes the newly added edges in order to make this decision. The second method, called the Modularity-Change-Rate algorithm, finds the rate of modularity change in a given network, and uses it to predict whether or not an update is required.Due to the sparsity of real datasets of evolving networks, we propose three models to generate evolving networks: a Random model, a model based on the well-known phenomenon of homophily in social networks, and another based on the phenomenon of triadic and cyclic closure. Starting with real-world data sets, we used these models to generate evolving networks. We evaluated the Edge-Distribution-Analysis algorithm and Modularity-Change-Rate algorithm on these data sets. Our results show that both our methods predict quite well when the community structure should be updated. They result in significant computational savings compared to approaches that would update the community structure after a fixed number of edge additions, while ensuring that the quality of the community structure is comparable.},

abstract = {Social list queries like 'valentines day gift ideas', 'best anniversary messages for your parents', etc. are quite popular on web search engines. Users expect instant answers comprising of a list of relevant items (social list) for such a query. Surprisingly, current search engines do not provide any crisp instant answers for queries in this critical query segment. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first system that tackles such queries. Although such social factors are heavily discussed on online social networks like Twitter, extracting such lists from tweets is quite challenging. How to discover such lists from tweets? We present a system that identifies these 'social lists' from a large number of Twitter hashtags using a high recall classifier trained using novel task-specific features with good accuracy. Further, we briefly discuss how list items can be extracted from related tweets. Experiments over a dataset of ~4M tweets show that our recall-optimized system can obtain up to 75.5% precision at 95.3% recall.},

abstract = {Finding communities in networks has become very important because various social and physical complex systems are represented as networks. Because of their ability to address large networks, local community detection methods that start from a seed node have become the focus of many research endeavours in recent times. In this paper, a derivative-based local community detection method, inspired by active contours, is proposed for finding a community surrounding an initial seed. The method is based on the concepts of curvature and gradient of the current communitys boundary. Curvature and gradient comprise the velocity function used to determine whether the boundary should move to include a candidate node in its vicinity. Unlike Euclidean space, networks have non-uniform space with fluctuations of dimensionality, given by the fluctuation in degrees of nodes, which complicates the calculation of derivatives used to define the curvature and gradient of boundary nodes. In this research, with some intuitive imagination, a framework for approximating derivatives in network space is proposed. Benchmarking this community detection method against three contemporary methods shows that it is capable of building communities with equal or better conductance.},

abstract = {Complex networks constitute the backbones of many complex systems such as social networks. Detecting the community structure in a complex network is both a challenging and a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we present the HAMUHI-CODE, a novel fast heuristic algorithm for multi-scale hierarchical community detection inspired on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique. We define a new structural similarity of vertices based on the classical cosine similarity by removing some vertices in order to increase the probability of identifying inter-cluster edges. Then we use the proposed structural similarity in a new agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that does not merge only clusters with maximal similarity as in the classical approach, but merges any cluster that does not meet a parameterized community definition with its most similar adjacent cluster. The algorithm computes all the similar clusters at the same time is checking if each cluster meets the parameterized community definition. It is done in linear time complexity in terms of the number of cluster in the iteration. Since a complex network is a sparse graph, our approach HAMUHI-CODE has a super-linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input in the worst-case scenario (if the clusters merge in pairs), making it suitable to be applied on large-scale complex networks. To test the properties and the efficiency of our algorithm we have conducted extensive experiments on real world and synthetic benchmark networks by comparing it to several baseline state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {In the modern financial market, market participants use big data analytics to gain valuable insight on historical market data for better decision making. Complying with the three vs (i.e., velocity, volume and variety) of big data, the financial market is considered as a complex system comprised of many interacting high-frequency traders those make decisions based on the relative strengths of these interactions. Researchers have put substantial scholarly input to deal with these anomalies. From the big data perspective, anomaly detection in financial data has widely been ignored despite many organisations store, process and disseminate financial market data for interested customers to assist them to make informed decision abd create competitive advantages. Considering the presence of anomalies in voluminous data from myriad data sources may generate catastrophic decision through misunderstandings of market behaviour. Therefore, in this study, we applied a standard set of anomaly detection techniques, used in big data based on nearest-neighbours, clustering and statistical approaches, to detect rare anomalies present within the historical daily trading information for five years (i.e., 2009--2013) for each stock listed on the Australian Security Exchange (ASX). We also measured the performance of these anomaly detection techniques using a number of metrics to highlight the best performing algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the LOF(Local Outlier Factor) and CMGOS(Clustering-based Multivariate Gaussian Outlier Score) are the best performing anomaly detection techniques.},

abstract = {Existing collaborative ranking based recommender systems tend to perform best when there is enough observed ratings for each user, and the observed data is uniformly sampled at random. However, when the observed ratings are extremely sparse (e.g. in the case of cold-start item where no rating data is available), and are not sampled uniformly at random, existing ranking methods fail to effectively leverage side information to transduct the knowledge from existing ratings to unobserved ones. We propose a semi-supervised collaborative ranking model, dubbed S2COR, to improve the quality of cold-start item recommendation. S2COR mitigates the sparsity issue by leveraging side information about both observed and missing ratings by collaboratively learning the ranking model. This enables it to deal with the case of data missing not at random, but to also effectively incorporate the available side information in transduction. We experimentally evaluated our proposed algorithm on a number of challenging real-world datasets and compared our results against state-of-the-art models for cold-start recommendation. We show significantly higher quality recommendations with our algorithm when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Detrimental online behavior such as harassment and cyberbullying is becoming a serious, large-scale problem damaging people's lives. This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection.},

In this paper we present Reveal, a fine-grained recommender system for social networks, designed to recommend media content posted by the user's friends. The intuition is to leverage the abundance of pre-existing information and identify overlapping user interests in specific sub-categories. While our system is intended as a component of the social network, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation for Facebook and experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.},

In such situations, identifying needs and availabilities of various types of resources is critical for effective coordination of the relief operations. We focus on the problem of automatically identifying tweets that inform about needs and availabilities of resources, termed as need-tweets and availability-tweets respectively. Traditionally, pattern matching techniques are adopted to identify such tweets. In this work, we present novel retrieval methodologies, based on word embeddings, for automatically identifying need-tweets and availability-tweets. Experiments over tweets posted during two recent disaster events show that the proposed methodologies outperform prior pattern-matching techniques.},

For this purpose, we adopt a descriptive modelling through a network approach that consists first in generating the collaborative network from data on publications. Nodes of the network are then enriched with a set of individual attributes extracted from the publishing activity of each author. Finally, we search for conceptual views, a recent link clustering approach, which allows to summarize any kind of networks by highlighting the sets of attributes found frequently linked. Results show that it exists strong tendencies that unconsciously structure the collaboration behaviours. In this paper, we present these tendencies and show how they evolve according to different extraction thresholds.},

abstract = {Often graph theory is used to model and analyze different behaviors of networks including social networks. Nowadays, social networks have become very popular and social network providers try to expand their networks by encouraging people to stay engaged and active. Studies show that engagement and activities of people in social networks influence engagement of their connections. This behavior has been modeled by the k-core problem in graph theory with the assumption that a person stays active in the network if he or she has k or more connections. In the above model if a person drops out, his or her friends can become discouraged and they might also drop out. An approach called anchored k-core algorithm has been introduced lately that prevents a cascade of drop-outs by finding nodes which have the most influence on their connections and rewarding them to stay in the network. In this work, an efficient implementation of the anchored 2-core approach has been proposed. The proposed implementation method was applied to a set of real world network data that includes very large graphs with millions of links. The results show that with only a few anchors, it is possible to save hundreds of nodes for the 2-core graph. Also, the execution time of our implementation is in order of minutes for huge datasets which proves the efficiency of our implementation.},

abstract = {Completeness as one of the four major dimensions of data quality is a pervasive issue in modern databases. Although data imputation has been studied extensively in the literature, most of the research is focused on inference-based approach. We propose to harness Web tables as an external data source to effectively and efficiently retrieve missing data while taking into account the inherent uncertainty and lack of veracity that they contain.Existing approaches mostly rely on standard retrieval techniques and out-of-the-box matching methods which result in a very low precision, especially when dealing with numerical data. We, therefore, propose a novel data imputation approach by applying numerical context similarity measures which results in a significant increase in the precision of the imputation procedure, by ensuring that the imputed values are of the same domain and magnitude as the local values, thus resulting in an accurate imputation.We use Dresden Web Table Corpus which is comprised of more than 125 million web tables extracted from the Common Crawl as our knowledge source. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method well outperforms the default out-of-the-box retrieval approach.},

abstract = {Advances in technology in the current era of big data has led to the high-velocity generation of high volumes of a wide variety of valuable data of different veracity. As rich sources of big data, social networks consist of users (or social entities) who are often linked by some interdependency such as 'following' relationships. Given these big social networks keep growing, there are situations in which an individual user (or business) wants to find those frequently followed groups of social entities so that he can follow the same groups. Discovery of these frequently followed groups can be challenging because the social networks are usually very big (with lots of users/social entities) but can be sparse (with most users only know some but not all users/social entities in a social network). In this paper, we present a few social network mining algorithms that use compressed models in mining these very big but sparse social networks for discovering groups of frequently followed social entities. Evaluation results show the practicality of our algorithms in efficient mining of 'following' patterns from very big but sparse social networks.},

abstract = {Emojis have been frequently used to express users' sentiments, emotions, and feelings in text-based communication. To facilitate sentiment analysis of users' posts, an emoji sentiment lexicon with positive, neutral, and negative scores has been recently constructed using manually labeled tweets. However, the number of emojis listed in the lexicon is smaller than that of currently existing emojis, and expanding the lexicon manually requires time and effort to reconstruct the labeled dataset. This paper presents a simple and efficient method for automatically constructing an emoji sentiment lexicon with arbitrary sentiment categories. The proposed method extracts sentiment words from WordNet-Affect and calculates the cooccurrence frequency between the sentiment words and each emoji. Based on the ratio of the number of occurrences of each emoji among the sentiment categories, each emoji is assigned a multidimensional vector whose elements indicate the strength of the corresponding sentiment. In experiments conducted on a collection of tweets, we show a high correlation between the conventional lexicon and our lexicon for three sentiment categories. We also show the results for a new lexicon constructed with additional sentiment categories.},

We examine several hypotheses about team formation using a large, longitudinal dataset from a team-based online gaming environment. Specifically, we test how positive familiarity, homophily, and competence determine team formation in Battlefield 4, a popular team-based game in which players choose one of two competing teams to play on. Our dataset covers over two months of in-game interactions between over 380,000 players. We show that familiarity is an important factor in team formation, while homophily is not. Competence affects team formation in more nuanced ways: players with similarly high competence team up repeatedly, but large variation in competence discourages repeated interactions.},

abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted to identify, analyze and measure popular topics and public sentiment on Online Social Networks (OSNs) through text, especially during crisis events. However, little work has been done to understand such events through pictures posted on these networks. Given the potential of visual content for influencing users' thoughts and emotions, we perform a large-scale analysis to study and compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015. We propose a generalizable and highly automated 3-tier pipeline which utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract high-level human understandable image descriptors. We used these descriptors to associate themes and sentiment with images, and analyzed over 57,000 images related to the Paris Attacks. We discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text. We also uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user-generated textual content. Further, our analysis revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment. These findings suggest that large-scale mining of images posted on OSNs during crisis, and other news-making events can significantly augment textual content to understand such events.},

The categories of features used to train the classifier reflect four different dimensions of social media: textual, temporal, social, and multimedia content. We detail the approach followed to design the feature space and report on experiments conducted on two large music festivals in the UK, namely the VFestival and Creamfields events. Our attendance classifier attains very high accuracy with the highest result observed for the Creamfields dataset ~87% accuracy to classify users that will participate in the event.},

Using these features we devise a model to predict if a book shall become a best seller after one month (15 days) since its publication. On a balanced set, we are able to achieve a very high avg. accuracy of 88.72% (85.66%) for the prediction where the other competitive class contains books which are randomly selected from the Goodreads dataset.

In this paper, we propose a growth model for user-object bipartite network that investigate the selection behaviors of web users. In this model, both web user and object sets grow continuously but edges arise only from the user set. These edges are attached with a combination of preferential and random attachment mechanism. To validate our model, we consider eight distinct real-world user-object networks. Our results show good agreements between real data, model and simulation. We observe that selection behaviors of new and old users are different towards objects in different networks. Conversely, popular and unpopular objects are selected differently by these web users. We notice interesting temporal patterns in randomness of selection behaviors of new and old users in different networks.},

abstract = {Natural and artificial sequences of big data streams have various stationary and non-stationary properties. A Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system has a quantum random number generator to protect data streams in quantum communication environments. From a cryptanalysis viewpoint, it is necessary to use statistical probability, stochastic processes and time series to evaluate quality of stationary randomness in quantum cryptographic sequrences.In this paper, a testing model is proposed to use statistical probability to illustrate multiple visual distributions on three maps for a selected random sequence. Under a shift operation to transfer the sequence into a shifted sequence, multiple segments are divided on the shifted sequence as three measuring sets to form three maps. For a given map, its maximal value is extracted from the distribution and three maximal values for the testing. Three 2D maps represent stationary random properties for the sequence under different shift operations. Conditions of station/stationary random sequences are investigated.Testing data sets are from two quantum cryptographic resources: Australian National University (ANU) and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), two quantum cryptographic sequences are selected. Multiple results are created on three maps, and measurements of stationary randomness are illustrated. Using the testing system, measurements of stationary randomness are compared. There are only 0.07 ~ 0.27% variation differences identified among ANU and USTC samples for testing stationary randomness. Both samples show excellent stationary properties.},

abstract = {Many publications deal with profile matching across online social networks and the approaches become increasingly complex. Almost all of them rely on common profile attributes like names and hobbies or structural attributes like relations to other user profiles. These approaches require high effort concerning computation, because each profile of one network has to be compared to all profiles of the other network. Complex approaches are not well suited to handle large datasets. Therefore, we present an approach to significantly reduce complexity by exploiting special properties of dataset IDs. We provide a proof of concept by an implementation of the use case of matching user profiles accross Twitter and Instagram. Additionally to the complexity problem of existing approaches, many profiles with similar attributes often lead to a restrictive trade-off between precision and recall of the matching strategy. Furthermore, profile attributes and relationships are not trustworthy, as these are due to arbitrary change by profile owners. In contrast to most existing approaches that rely on user definable attributes, we rather focus on timing properties of user publications across social media platforms. There are already profile matching approaches based on timing patterns. However, these do not aim to reduce complexity, what is a necessary requirement to be applicable to real-world online social networks. As we will show, the approach can be easily transferred to other networks.},

We represent a financial system using a weighted directed graph model. We enhance a novel open source risk engine to automatically classify a financial regulation for its impact on systemic risk. The analysis finds that introducing collateralization does reduce the costs of resolving a financial system in crisis. It does not, however, change the distribution of risk in the system. The analysis also highlights the importance of scenario based testing using hands on metrics to quantify the notion of system risk.},

abstract = {Most information spreading models consider that all individuals are identical psychologically. They ignore, for instance, the curiosity level of people, which may indicate that they can be influenced to seek for information given their interest. For example, the game Pok\'{e}mon GO spread rapidly because of the aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information propagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is a dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our model in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or IC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world networks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a mean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of macroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's behavior with the curiosity. We also obtain an analytical solution of the mean-field equations that allows to predicts a transition from a phase where the information remains confined to a small number of users to a phase where it spreads over a large fraction of the population. The results indicate that the curiosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with the spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial networks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the maximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition point. Since curious people are more open to a new product, concepts, and ideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling. Our results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between diffusion process and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks.},

abstract = {We propose BotWalk, a near-real time adaptive Twitter exploration algorithm to identify bots exhibiting novel behavior. Due to suspension pressure, Twitter bots are constantly changing their behavior to evade detection. Traditional supervised approaches to bot detection are non-adaptive and thus cannot identify novel bot behaviors. We therefore devise an unsupervised approach, which allows us to identify bots as they evolve. We characterize users with a behavioral feature vector which consists of (well-studied in isolation) metadata-, content-, temporal-, and network-based features. We identify a random bot from our seed bank, populated initially by previously-labeled bots, gather this user's followers' features from Twitter in real time, and employ an unsupervised ensemble anomaly detection method in the multi-dimensional behavioral space. These potential bots are folded into the seed bank and the process is then repeated, with the new seeds' features allowing us to adaptively identify novel bot behavior. BotWalk allows for the identification of on average 6,000 potential bots a day. Our method allowed us to detect 7,995 previously undiscovered bots from a sample of 15 seed bots with a precision of 90%.},

abstract = {In many developing countries there remains a limited view on the socioeconomic status of the population, owing to the high cost associated with detailed and comprehensive surveying. This situation has encouraged a number of researchers to attempt to exploit alternative sources of data in order to derive estimates, including mobile phone data, which offers a rich depiction of the social dynamics of a population. Meanwhile, from the level of the individual to the city, access to information has been posited as an important factor in determining prosperity and economic development. In this paper we explore this relationship by simulating the flow of information through a mobile phone call graph in two sub-Saharan countries. We find a strong relationship between a location's average wealth and its access to information as determined by the simulations in one country, and a weaker correlation in the second country. This finding adds to recent evidence that mining patterns from mobile phone data represents a viable means to estimate poverty in places where traditionally derived estimates are lacking. We further investigate the impact of various factors on the empirical results in order to explain the variation between the two countries.},

abstract = {Twitter has recently become one of the most popular online social networking websites where users can share news and ideas through messages in the form of tweets. As a tweet gets retweeted from user to user, large cascades of information diffusion are formed over the Twitter follower network. Existing works on cascades have mainly focused on predicting their popularity in terms of size. In this paper, we leverage on the temporal pattern of retweets to model the diffusion dynamics of a cascade. Notably, retweet cascades provide two complementary information: (a) inter-retweet time intervals of retweets, and (b) diffusion of cascade over the underlying follower network. Using datasets from Twitter, we identify two types of cascades based on presence or absence of early peaks in their sequence of inter-retweet intervals. We identify multiple diffusion localities associated with a cascade as it propagates over the network. Our studies reveal the transition of a cascade to a new locality facilitated by pivotal users that are highly cascade dependent following saturation of current locality. We propose an analytical model to show co-occurrence of first peaks and cascade migration to a new locality as well as predict locality saturation from inter-retweet intervals. Finally, we validate these claims from empirical data showing co-occurrence of first peaks and migration with good accuracy; we obtain even better accuracy for successfully classifying saturated and non-saturated diffusion localities from inter-retweet intervals.},

abstract = {Effective friend classification in Online Social Networks (OSN) has many benefits in privacy. Anything posted by a user in social networks like Facebook is distributed among all their friends. Although the user can select the manual option for their post-dissemination, it is not feasible every time. Since not all friends are the same in social networks, the visibility access for the post should be different for different strengths of friendship for privacy. Previous works in finding friendship strength in social networks have used interaction and similarity based features but none of them has considered using sentiment-based features as the driving factor to determine the strength.In this paper, we develop a supervised model to estimate the friendship strength based upon 23 different features comprising of structure based, interaction based, homophily based and sentiment based features. We evaluate our model on a real-world Facebook dataset we built that has ground truth for different types of friendship: close, good, acquaintance, and casual. Our model obtains an AUROC of 0.82 in identifying acquaintances from all the other three categories, and an AUROC of 0.85 in distinguishing between close friends and acquaintances. Our experiments suggest that features like average comment length, reaction scores for likes and love, friend tag score, Jaccard similarity and closeness variable consistently perform better in predicting friendship strength across different classifiers. In addition, combining language-based features with homophilic, structural and interaction features produces more accurate and trustworthy model to evaluate friendship strength.},

For the data collection stage, the Twitter streaming application programming interface (API) was used and VirusTotal was used for labelling the dataset. A random forest classification model was used with a combination of features derived from a range of sources. The random forest model without any tuning and feature selection produced a recall value of 0.89. After further investigation and applying parameter tuning and feature selection methods, however, we were able to improve the classifier performance to 0.92 in recall.},

abstract = {The interaction between members within an organization evolves continuously and drives the organizational behavior to change over time. To understand the temporal behaviors of the organization and recognize the evolving characteristics of the networks, we need effective tools that can capture evolution of the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel and important problem in evolution behavior discovery. Given a series of snapshots of a temporal dataset, which are modeled as evolving social networks, our goal is to find networks which evolve in a dramatically different way that deviate from temporal pattern norm. We define such objects as organizational behavior anomalies. It is a challenging problem as temporal patterns are hidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difficult to distinguish anomalous objects from normal ones. To this end, we propose a social network based temporal pattern mining framework to detect organizational behavior anomalies. Specifically, we first give the definition and a brief description of organizational behavior anomalies. Then, we extract a number of features in the temporal dataset for profiling organizational networks. Third, we use the temporal pattern mining framework to evaluate anomalies of networks deviating from the normal evolutionary patterns. Within the proposed framework, a two-step procedure that exploits the strengths of unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised classification is used. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed framework is highly effective in discovering interesting organizational behavior anomalies.},

Social network analysis techniques are applied to analyze group structures as well as influences of each member. We collect a real telecom fraud dataset with 113 fraudsters whose fraudulent activities spread across four countries and 17 cities.

This paper investigates the utility of supervised learning techniques for abuse detection in future decentralized settings, where less metadata remains available for use in learning algorithms. We present a method that uses a privacy-preserving protocol to exchange a fingerprint of the neighborhood of a pair of nodes, namely sender and receiver. Our method extracts social graph metadata to form a subset of key features, namely neighborhood knowledge, some of which we approximate to reduce communication and computational requirements of such a protocol. In our benchmarking we show that a data minimization approach can obtain features 13% faster while providing similar or, as with the SVM classifier, even better abuse detection rates with just approximated Private Set Intersection.},

abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) have seen a remarkable rise in the presence of surreptitious automated accounts. Massive human user-base and business-supportive operating model of social networks (such as Twitter) facilitates the creation of automated agents. In this paper we outline a systematic methodology and train a classifier to categorise Twitter accounts into 'automated' and 'human' users. To improve classification accuracy we employ a set of novel steps. First, we divide the dataset into four popularity bands to compensate for differences in types of accounts. Second, we create a large ground truth dataset using human annotations and extract relevant features from raw tweets. To judge accuracy of the procedure we calculate agreement among human annotators as well as with a bot detection research tool. We then apply a Random Forests classifier that achieves an accuracy close to human agreement. Finally, as a concluding step we perform tests to measure the efficacy of our results.},

abstract = {Many adult content websites incorporate social networking features. Although these are popular, they raise significant challenges, including the potential for users to "catfish", i.e., to create fake profiles to deceive other users. This paper takes an initial step towards automated catfish detection. We explore the characteristics of the different age and gender groups, identifying a number of distinctions. Through this, we train models based on user profiles and comments, via the ground truth of specially verified profiles. When applying our models for age and gender estimation to unverified profiles, 38% of profiles are classified as lying about their age, and 25% are predicted to be lying about their gender. The results suggest that women have a greater propensity to catfish than men. Our preliminary work has notable implications on operators of such online social networks, as well as users who may worry about interacting with catfishes.},

We develop various turnover risk models and we compare how different features affect performance prediction. The results show that the top three features that explain turnover risk are: ratio of likes received (likeability), posting frequency (engagement), and relative happiness (employee happiness normalized by company mean). Surprisingly, a priori expected explanatory features such as mean happiness level and the ratio of likes (positivity), were not significant.

In this paper, we provide an insightful study of the pop music artists and fans social network. Particularly, we segment the pop music consumer market and pop music artists respectively. Our results show that due to the Matthew Effect and limited diversity of consumer market, "Fans Economy" does not work for the Chinese pop music industry.},

The method utilizes multisource data, combining bibliometric and econometrics analyses to achieve the network core of the existing collaboration network, and institution competitiveness in the innovation chain. Empirical analysis of the genetic engineering vaccine field shows that throughout the distribution characteristics of creative technologies from different institutions, the analysis based on the innovation chain can identify more complementarities between institutions. Compared to previous studies, this study emulates the real conditions of IURC. The rule of technological innovation can be better revealed, potential partners of IURC can be more easily identified, and the conclusion has a higher value in consultation. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for research and development cooperation.},

Someone's perception on a product can be the sole decision maker which decides the selling pattern of the product. Parts of speech are key elements of measuring the sentiment score of a given sentence. Verbs can be considered as the driving force of a sentence hence verbs play a vital role in sentiment analysis. All the existing mechanisms to measure the computational value for verbs are based on adjective centric approaches. This research introduces a novel approach in measuring verbs score. We have introduced new verb semantics which cover all the categories of verbs. Based on those semantics, new verb scoring axioms are implemented. Then new set of hybrid algorithms have been formulated in terms of word, sentence and paragraph level scoring. Specially a new sentence level scoring algorithm has been developed considering adjective-verb-adverb combinations. All the newly implemented functions have been compared with the existing scoring functions using movie reviews as the data domain. It can be experienced that the novel functions are performed better than existing functions where the novel functions perform an accuracy of 83% in precision.},

It helps to find the structure of ties and its impact on individuals, groups or even incidents. This article is a similar attempt to explore the vehicles and vehicle-related violations leading to accidents through the use of SNA. SNA is performed on accident data of New York for 2016. SNA measures including degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality are used to probe into the impact of ties between actors of accidents. The empirical analysis shows that 'Passenger vehicle' with degree centrality of 7513 has the highest degree of accidents, explaining 41.12% of total accidents. In addition, it is involved in 57.42% of accidents when accidents occur between same types of vehicles. 'Sport utility/station wagon' and 'taxi' rank second and third in this category with degree values of 4657 and 1454 respectively. It is also found that 'driver inattention' holds the pivotal place when violations leading to accidents are concerned. It accounts for 19.09% accidents in general and 44.58% when accidents, where both parties commit the same violation, are considered. 'Failure to yield right-of-way' and 'following too closely' are ranked second and third. Research also finds that Manhattan area of New York is marked by elevated number of accidents.},

Unlike most of the well-studied credit card fraud, where only one party illicitly seeks financial gain, fraudulent cash-out involves both parties of the transaction. When prior information, such as credit score and reputation score, about the majority of consumers and shops is available, the phenomenon can be readily analyzed by using the Markov random field models. In this paper, we investigate the detection of fraudulent cash-out under the circumstance where no prior information but only the labels of a small set of consumers and shops are available. The novelty of this work is building a semi-supervised learning algorithm that automatically tunes the prior and parameters in Markov random field while inferring labels for every node in the graph. We evaluate our algorithm with data from JD Finance.},

In this work, we analyze images posted on social media platforms during natural disasters to determine the level of damage caused by the disasters. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to perform an extensive experimentation of damage assessment using images from four major natural disasters. We show that the domain-specific fine-tuning of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques such as Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW). High classification accuracy under both event-specific and cross-event test settings demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively adapt deep-CNN features to identify the severity of destruction from social media images taken after a disaster strikes.},

abstract = {A subgraph H of a given graph G is isometric if the distances between every pair of vertices in H are the same as the distances of those vertices in G. We say a graph G is distance preserving if there exists an isometric subgraph of every possible order up to the order of G. Distance preserving property has been applied to many real world problems such as route recommendation systems and all kinds of shortest-path-related applications. Here, we propose a biologically-inspired search algorithm to address the problem of finding isometric subgraphs that consequently determines if a given graph is distance preserving. In this algorithm, using a well defined fitness function, selection operator selects almost isometric subgraphs to generate the offspring for the next generation. There is a trade-off between the population size and searching speed. On one hand, the larger the population size is, the slower the search algorithm would be. On the other hand, by increasing the population size, we increase the likelihood of finding an existing isometric subgraph. Experimental results depict the performance of the proposed algorithm in finding isometric subgraphs even for challenging problems, and interestingly by these results one can see that "almost" all graphs are distance preserving. In closing, we show the smallest distance preserving graph whose product factors are not distance preserving. This graph has 80 vertices, and can be used as benchmark for algorithms in this concept.},

However, this is small percentage compared to all the data shared in such online platforms, which also includes private/personal information, simple chat messages and the recent called 'fake news'. In this paper, we make an exploratory analysis on two social networks to extract features that are indicators of relevant information in social network messages. Our goal is to build accurate machine learning models that are capable of detecting what is journalistically relevant. We conducted two experiments on CrowdFlower to build a solid ground truth for the models, by comparing the number of evaluations per post against the number of posts classified. The results show evidence that increasing the number of samples will result in a better performance on the relevancy classification task, even when relaxing in the number of evaluations per post. In addition, results show that there are significant correlations between the relevance of a post and its interest and whether is meaningfully for the majority of people. Finally, we achieve approximately 80% accuracy in the task of relevance detection using a small set of learning algorithms.},

Social network modelling is a way to study that public discourse, by looking at how opinions in a discourse interact and repeat themselves on a large scale and over time. This study aims to construct a social network model using an agent-based approach to measure whether the conversation space of certain gender violence discourses are more centered on victims, perpetrators, institutions, or society. It will use network measures of centrality, immediate impact analysis, and centrality changes over time to compare the context of two cultures: Philippines and the United States. The data set from the Philippines consists of articles on the Vizconde Massacre and the data set from the United States consists of articles on the Stanford Rape Case. Results show that both datasets feature an institution-centric discourse that is consistent over time, and that society has the lowest role-centrality in both events. Perpetrators appear more central than victims, but comparatively more so in the Stanford Rape dataset compared to the Vizconde Massacre one.},

Deep learning helps in overcoming the shortcomings of traditional machine Learning techniques. In this paper, three approaches have been proposed, a simple CNN that uses word embeddings as input, a CNN that uses WordNet scores as input and RNN based approach with both LSTM and bi-directional LSTM.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of social networks have enabled users to instantly share what is happening around them. With the character-limitation and other feature constraints imposed by microblogs, users are obliged to express their intentions in implicit forms. This behavior poses many challenges for contextual approaches that aim to identify user intentions. Furthermore, users have the tendency to display different degree of preferences towards specific interests, simultaneously in time, making it difficult for models to rank the discovered interests. We propose a dynamic interest keyword model, a graph-based ranking mechanism, that identifies the different degrees of interests of a user. Our results show that the proposed system detects human-inferred interests, 94% of the time, showing that the model is feasible and contributes various insights that can be used to improve user intention identification systems.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an oscillation model for describing the flaming phenomena in on-line social networks, and discusses countermeasures to flaming based on the proposed oscillation model. The most significant feature of the proposed model is that the cause of flaming can be explained by the structure of the network. Based on the proposed model, we can suppress the generation of flaming by controlling link weights of a part of the network. This passive solution to flaming is important for the stable operation of social media networks.},

abstract = {Strong social networks can encourage healthy behaviors. In this paper, we introduce a sociology-based computational framework for influence networks. The model construct is generic and is applicable to diverse social network analysis. We demonstrate its usage in calibrating the positive influence of church clergy in spreading HIV/AIDs information in a large metropolitan city. Five experiments are designed to contrast influence with respect to the interaction style between clergy and churchgoers. Competitive and non-competitive knowledge dissemination are also analyzed. The results show that when only one set of information exists, the spreading scope is directly proportional to the product of population size and the disease infection rate. When competing information is present, the importance of clergy in spreading the information decreases when the original propagation sources are ample. However, if sufficient interaction and trust are present among the clergy and the participants, the clergy's positive influence remains significant despite pre-existing knowledge. The generalized framework requires minimal regional data to establish the influence network. It provides useful policy insights for decision makers to determine effective avenues for information dissemination through community influencers.},

abstract = {Online interaction networks are highly dynamic. They provide opportunities to share information more widely and faster than ever before, but result in rather complicated trajectories of information flow that present new challenges for modeling and analysis. Collecting the right data, processing it appropriately and determining which networks to analyze are some of the challenges we face. The ease with which data can be sourced through Twitter's API has resulted in a disproportionate number of studies analyzing 'big data'. This focus has led researchers to overlook the importance of 'small data': traditional methods of data collection, such as survey and experimental studies. Clever data extraction and processing capabilities are absolutely necessary to deal with the enormous quantity of data generated by Internet-mediated interactions. However, the richness at the level of the individual may be overlooked if big data approaches are exclusively used, potentially resulting in inappropriate generalizations and conclusions. In this paper we study results from a qualitative study on Twitter users' behavior and combine them with dynamic network analysis to investigate the manifestations of Twitter relations.},

abstract = {With the rise of social media, millions of people are routinely expressing their moods, feelings, and daily struggles with mental health issues on social media platforms like Twitter. Unlike traditional observational cohort studies conducted through questionnaires and self-reported surveys, we explore the reliable detection of clinical depression from tweets obtained unobtrusively. Based on the analysis of tweets crawled from users with self-reported depressive symptoms in their Twitter profiles, we demonstrate the potential for detecting clinical depression symptoms which emulate the PHQ-9 questionnaire clinicians use today. Our study uses a semi-supervised statistical model to evaluate how the duration of these symptoms and their expression on Twitter (in terms of word usage patterns and topical preferences) align with the medical findings reported via the PHQ-9. Our proactive and automatic screening tool is able to identify clinical depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 68% and precision of 72%.},

Contents-based features are proposed to recommend interdisciplinary collaboration considering that some researchers who have shown a preference for interdisciplinary collaboration could be connected even if they have dissimilar research profiles. Therefore, we inferred the preference of interdisciplinary research collaboration for every researcher, and considered features such as highlighting dissimilar researchers depending on their preferences. The features are designed to have typical similarity measures when the researchers do not prefer interdisciplinary research collaboration. We evaluated our proposed features with the baseline features of patent application datasets and the former methods outperformed the latter methods.},

abstract = {Community detection is one of the most studied topics in Social Network Analysis. Research in this realm has predominantly focus on finding out communities by considering the network as a whole. That is, all nodes are put in the same pool to define central metrics for finding out communities while ignoring the particularity of some nodes and their impact. Yet, if the position of some nodes matters when defining the metrics (i.e. node centric approach), the found communities may differ and can make more sens in real life situations. For instance, identifying the communities based on drug dealers and their interactions with others sounds better than finding communities while ignoring the individuals status. The purpose of this paper is to detect ego-centered community, which is defined as a community built from a particular node. Our solution is set to combine both link direction and weight, and therefore, differs from many existing solutions. Basically, we rely on a metric called a quality function that uses link properties to assess the cohesion of identified groups. Our method detect communities that reflect not only the structure but the reality regarding to the interaction nature in terms of intensity. We implement our solution and use "Les Miserables" dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.},

Indeed, there is a growing number of applications that call for user (social) intervention with the aim of helping each other in solving complex tasks or rating other users work. The topic is even more intriguing when a reward is given to users that properly complete their tasks. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of user mutual rankings in a collaborative network where they contribute to the solution of complex tasks. We leverage Exponential Random Graph to model user interaction rankings and we evaluate our approach in a real life scenario.},
