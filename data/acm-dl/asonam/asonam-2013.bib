abstract = {Social networks are ever-growing systems by inheritance. The increase in the number nodes in these systems often brings forth the need to add additional functionalities. However due to the distributed nature of social networks, system growth can be a challenging task. Therefore scalability of the system is of vital importance in the design of social networks. This research attempts to establish a comprehensive framework for analysis and validation of requirements and design documents for software systems. In previous work, we applied this framework to analyze the requirements of a social network of agents; expressed using scenario-based specifications. Scenarios are appealing because of their expressive power and simplicity. Moreover due to the clear and concise notation of scenarios, they can be used to analyze the system requirements for general validity, lack of deadlock, and existence of emergent behavior. In this paper a methodology to analyze the scalability of social networks is presented. This methodology is devised to indicate whether or not the new requirements of the system are consistent with the current requirements in place. A larger prototype of a social network of MSA for semantic search is utilized to illustrate the developed methodology.},

abstract = {Popular social networking sites have revolutionized the way people interact on the Web, enabling rapid information dissemination and search. In an enterprise, understanding how information flows within and between organizational levels and business units is of great importance. Despite numerous studies in information diffusion in online social networks, little is known about factors that affect the dynamics of technological adoption at the workplace. Here, we address this problem, by examining the impact of organizational hierarchy in adopting new technologies in the enterprise. Our study suggests that middle-level managers are more successful in influencing employees into adopting a new microblogging service. Further, we reveal two distinct patterns of peer pressure, based on which employees are not only more likely to adopt the service, but the rate at which they do so quickens as the popularity of the new technology increases. We integrate our findings into two intuitive, realistic agent-based computational models that capture the dynamics of adoption at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. We evaluate our models in a real-world dataset we collected from a multinational Fortune 500 company. Prediction results show that our models provide great improvements over commonly used diffusion models. Our findings provide significant insights to managers seeking to realize the dynamics of adoption of new technologies in their company, and could assist in designing better strategies for rapid and efficient technology adoption and information dissemination at the workplace.},

abstract = {The increase in the use of mobile phones generates the formation of mobile social networks which can make use of various purposes including education, public health and controlling epidemics. Social networks consist of the basic building blocks called as the communities within which the social interactions are intensive, but between which they are very weak. Everyone could observe that the spread of infectious disease inside communities often has the ability to cross countries borders and spread rapidly. With the widespread of diseases causing major public health problem, we argue that human mobility patterns not only influence the spreading, but are also useful for preventing and creating awareness of the diseases. In this paper, we present new opportunities offered by the field of mobile social networks for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. For this purpose we propose two models namely MABM (Mobile Agent Based Model) and SDC (Spread Discovery Control) model to understand the spread of communicable diseases between different regions. The proposed SDC model is used to comprehend the spread of diseases by extracting the community structures and the analysis of mobility pattern of each agent (user) within the mobile network. Moreover, the understanding of spread details helps us to propose the control strategy to avoid the spread of the epidemic disease on the specific region. To realize our proposed models in a better way, we have modeled one such communicable disease usually spreading every year in West African region.},

abstract = {Maximizing product adoption within a customer social network under a constrained advertising budget is an important special case of the general influence maximization problem. Specialized optimization techniques that account for product correlations and community effects can outperform network-based techniques that do not model interactions that arise from marketing multiple products to the same consumer base. However, it can be infeasible to use exact optimization methods that utilize expensive matrix operations on larger networks without parallel computation techniques. In this paper, we present a hierarchical influence maximization approach for product marketing that constructs an abstraction hierarchy for scaling optimization techniques to larger networks. An exact solution is computed on smaller partitions of the network, and a candidate set of influential nodes is propagated upward to an abstract representation of the original network that maintains distance information. This process of abstraction, solution, and propagation is repeated until the resulting abstract network is small enough to be solved exactly. Our proposed method scales to much larger networks and outperforms other influence maximization techniques on marketing products.},

User profile migration is a promising feature that would enable users to seamlessly migrate their profile data between different pods. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research done on how this data portability may affect the user distribution and the performance of the pods. In this paper, our goal is to design an approach that facilitates the users to choose appropriate pods that would ensure better service quality. We propose a decentralized game-theoretic approach that is based on user's local neighborhood information and the quality of the pods. We have analytically determined, and experimentally substantiated, that through the proposed profile migration approach the users of Diaspora reach a stable and balanced distribution that improves their overall experience in respective pods.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of dynamically growing digital data that can be used for extracting social networks has led to an upsurge of interest in the analysis of dynamic social networks. One key aspect of social network analysis is to understand the central nodes in a network. However, dynamic calculation of centrality values for rapidly growing networks might be unfeasibly expensive, especially if it involves recalculation from scratch for each time period. This paper proposes an incremental algorithm that effectively updates betweenness centralities of nodes in dynamic social networks while avoiding re-computations by exploiting information from earlier computations. Our performance results suggest that our incremental betweenness algorithm can achieve substantial performance speedup, on the order of thousands of times, over the state of the art, including the best-performing non-incremental betweenness algorithm and a recently proposed betweenness update algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique for analysis of dynamic contact networks aimed at extracting periods of time during which the network changes behaviour. The technique is based on tracking the eigenvectors of the contact network in time (efficiently) using a technique called Joint Diagonalisation (JD). Repeated application of JD then shows that real-world networks naturally break into several modes of operation which are time dependent and in one real-world case, even periodic. This shows that a view of real-world contact networks as realisations from a single underlying static graph is mistaken. However, the analysis also shows that a small finite set of underlying static graphs can approximate the dynamic contact graphs studied. We also provide the means by which these underlying approximate graphs can be constructed.Core to the approach is the analysis of spanning trees constructed on the contact network. These trees are the routes a broadcast would take given a random starting location and we find that these propagation paths (in terms of their eigenvector decompositions) cluster into a small subset of modes which surprisingly correspond to clusters in time. The net result is that a dynamic network may be approximated as a (small finite) set of static graphs. Most interestingly the MIT dataset shows a periodic behaviour which allows us to know in advance which mode the network will be in. This has obvious consequences as individuals in the network take differing roles in differing modes. Finally, we demonstrate the technique by constructing a synthetic network with an 4 underlying modes of operation; creating synthetics contacts and then used JD to extract the original underlying modes.},

abstract = {The proliferation of social media has the potential for changing the structure and organization of the web. In the past, scientists have looked at the web as a large connected component to understand how the topology of hyperlinks correlates with the quality of information contained in the page and they proposed techniques to rank information contained in web pages. We argue that information from web pages and network data on social relationships can be combined to create a personalized and socially connected web. In this paper, we look at the web as a composition of two networks, one consisting of information in web pages and the other of personal data shared on social media web sites. Together, they allow us to analyze how social media tunnels the flow of information from person to person and how to use the structure of the social network to rank, deliver, and organize information specifically for each individual user. We validate our social ranking concepts through a ranking experiment conducted on web pages that users shared on Google Buzz and Twitter.},

We first analyze the general structure of the social networks, e.g., graph distances and the degree distribution of the social networks. Our analysis confirms that the social networks of OSS communities follow power-law degree distributions and exhibit small-world characteristics. However, the degree mixing pattern shows that high degree nodes tend to connect more with low degree nodes, suggesting collaborations between experts and newbie developers. Second, we study the correlation between graph degrees and the productivity of the contributors in terms of the amount of contribution and commitment to OSS projects. The analysis demonstrates evident influence of the social ties on the developers' overall productivity.},

abstract = {Internet-based crowdsourcing systems can be viewed as a kind of loosely coupled social networks. With these systems, it is easy to collect multiple noisy labels for the same object when conducting annotation for supervised learning. Because non-expert labelers lack expertise and dedication, and have strong personal preference, they may have bias when labeling. These cause Imbalanced Multiple Noisy Labeling. In this paper, we propose an agnostic algorithm Positive LAbel frequency Threshold (PLAT) to deal with imbalanced labeling. Because of the dynamics of social networks, in most cases no information about the qualities of labelers and underlying class distributions can be acquired. PLAT does not require prior knowledge of the labeling qualities of labelers, the underlying class distributions, and the level of labeling imbalance. Simulations on eight real-world datasets with different underlying class distributions demonstrate that PLAT not only effectively deals with the imbalanced multiple noisy labeling that off-the-shelf agnostic methods cannot cope with, but also performs nearly the same as majority voting under the circumstances that labelers have no bias.},

abstract = {Partitioning large networks into smaller subnetworks (communities) is an important tool to analyze the structure of complex linked systems. In recent years, many in-memory community detection algorithms have been proposed for graphs with millions of edges. Analyzing massive graphs with billions of edges is impossible for existing algorithms. In this contribution, we show how to find community partitions of networks with billions of edges. Our approach is based on an ensemble learning scheme for community detection that provides a way to identify high quality partitions from an ensemble of partitions with lower quality. We present a pre-processing procedure for community detection algorithms that significantly decreases the problem size. After reducing the problem size, traditional non-distributed community detection algorithms can be applied. We implemented a weak but highly scalable label propagation algorithm on top of the distributed-computing framework Apache Hadoop. The evaluation of our implementation on a 50-node Hadoop cluster and with evaluation datasets up to 3.3 billion edges shows very good results with respect to clustering quality as well as scalability. For a smaller 260 million edge network, we show that our preprocessing can improve the results of the popular Louvain modularity clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {Community detection has emerged as an attractive topic due to the increasing need to understand and manage the networked data of tremendous magnitude. Networked data usually consists of links between the entities and the attributes for describing the entities. Various approaches have been proposed for detecting communities by utilizing the link information and/or attribute information. In this work, we study the problem of community detection for networked data with additional authorship information. By authorship, each entity in the network is authored by another type of entities (e.g., wiki pages are edited by users, products are purchased by customers), to which we refer as authors. Communities of entities are affected by their authors, e.g., two entities that are associated with the same author tend to belong to the same community. Therefore leveraging the authorship information would help us better detect the communities in the networked data. However, it also brings new challenges to community detection. The foremost question is how to model the correlation between communities and authorships. In this work, we address this question by proposing probabilistic models based on the popularity link model [1], which is demonstrated to yield encouraging results for community detection. We employ two methods for modeling the authorships: (i) the first one generates the authorships independently from links by community memberships and popularities of authors by analogy of the popularity link model; (ii) the second one models the links between entities based on authorships together with community memberships and popularities of nodes, which is an analog of previous author-topic model. Upon the basic models, we explore several extensions including (i) we model the community memberships of authors by that of their authored entities to reduce the number of redundant parameters; and (ii) we model the communities memberships of entities and/or authors by their attributes using a discriminative approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models by empirical studies.},

abstract = {Network structure and content in microblogging sites like Twitter influence each other ---user A on Twitter follows user B for the tweets that B posts on the network, and A may then re-tweet the content shared by B to his/her own followers. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to jointly model link communities and content topics by leveraging both the social graph and the content shared by users. We model a community as a distribution over users, use it as a source for topics of interest, and jointly infer both communities and topics using Gibbs sampling. While modeling communities using the social graph, or modeling topics using content have received a great deal of attention, a few recent approaches try to model topics in content-sharing platforms using both content and social graph. Our work differs from the existing generative models in that we explicitly model the social graph of users along with the user-generated content, mimicking how the two entities co-evolve in content-sharing platforms. Recent studies have found Twitter to be more of a content-sharing network and less a social network, and it seems hard to detect tightly knit communities from the follower-followee links. Still, the question of whether we can extract Twitter communities using both links and content is open. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our model discovers coherent communities and topics, as evinced by qualitative results on sub-graphs of Twitter users. Furthermore, we evaluate our model on the task of predicting follower-followee links. We show that joint modeling of links and content significantly improves link prediction performance on a sub-graph of Twitter (consisting of about 0.7 million users and over 27 million tweets), compared to generative models based on only structure or only content and paths-based methods such as Katz.},

abstract = {Social networks are usually drawn from the interactions between individuals, and therefore are temporal and dynamic in essence. Examining how the structure of these networks changes over time provides insights into their evolution patterns, factors that trigger the changes, and ultimately predict the future structure of these networks. One of the key structural characteristics of networks is their community structure --groups of densely interconnected nodes. Communities in a dynamic social network span over periods of time and are affected by changes in the underlying population, i.e. they have fluctuating members and can grow and shrink over time. In this paper, we introduce a new incremental community mining approach, in which communities in the current time are obtained based on the communities from the past time frame. Compared to previous independent approaches, this incremental approach is more effective at detecting stable communities over time. Extensive experimental studies on real datasets, demonstrate the applicability, effectiveness, and soundness of our proposed framework.},

Most of the proposed approaches have been developed for networks having only positive edges. In this paper we propose a multiobjective approach to detect communities in signed networks. The method partitions a network in groups of nodes such that two objectives are contemporarily optimized. The former is that the partitioning should have dense positive intra-connections and sparse negative interconnections, the latter is that it should have as few as possible negative intra-connections and positive inter-connections. We show that the concepts of signed modularity and frustration fulfill these objectives, and that the maximization of signed modularity and the minimization of frustration allow to obtain very good solutions to the problem. An extensive set of experiments on both real-life and synthetic signed networks shows the efficacy of the approach.},

abstract = {The popularity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) is often faced with challenges of dealing with undesirable users and their malicious activities in the social networks. The most common form of malicious activity over OSNs is spamming wherein a bot (fake user) disseminates content, malware/viruses, etc. to the legitimate users of the social networks. The common motives behind such activity include phishing, scams, viral marketing and so on which the recipients do not indent to receive. It is thus a highly desirable task to devise techniques and methods for identifying spammers (spamming accounts) in OSNs. With an aim of exploiting social network characteristics of community formation by legitimate users, this paper presents a community-based framework to identify spammers in OSNs. The framework uses community-based features of OSN users to learn classification models for identification of spamming accounts. The preliminary experiments on a real-world dataset with simulated spammers reveal that proposed approach is promising and that using community-based node features of OSN users can improve the performance of classifying spammers and legitimate users.},

abstract = {In the real world, various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networks which consist of entities of different types. People like to discover groups (or cliques) of entities linked to each other with rare and surprising associations from such networks. We define such anomalous cliques as <u>A</u>ssociation-<u>B</u>ased <u>C</u>lique Outliers (ABCOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks, and design effective approaches to detect them. The need to find such outlier cliques from networks can be formulated as a conjunctive select query consisting of a set of (type, predicate) pairs. Answering such conjunctive queries efficiently involves two main challenges: (1) computing all matching cliques which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities in the cliques. In this paper, we address these two challenges as follows. First, we introduce a new low-cost graph index to assist clique matching. Second, we define the outlierness of an association between two entities based on their attribute values and provide a methodology to efficiently compute such outliers given a conjunctive select query. Experimental results on several synthetic datasets and the Wikipedia dataset containing thousands of entities show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in computing interesting ABCOutliers.},

abstract = {We initiate a systematic study to help distinguish a special group of online users, called hidden paid posters, or termed "Internet water army" in China, from the legitimate ones. On the Internet, the paid posters represent a new type of online job opportunities. They get paid for posting comments or articles on different online communities and websites for hidden purposes, e.g., to influence the opinion of other people towards certain social events or business markets. While being an interesting strategy in business marketing, paid posters may create a significant negative effect on the online communities, since the information from paid posters is usually not trustworthy. When two competitive companies hire paid posters to post fake news or negative comments about each other, normal netizens may feel overwhelmed and find it difficult to put any trust in the information they acquire from the Internet. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the behavioral pattern of online paid posters based on real-world trace data. We design and validate a new detection mechanism, using both non-semantic analysis and semantic analysis, to identify potential online paid posters. Our test results with real-world datasets show a very promising performance.},

Consequently these gold farmers are actively banned by game administrators. The task of gold farmer detection is to identify gold farmers in a population of players but just like other clandestine actors they not labeled as such. In this paper the problem of extending the label of gold farmers to players which are not labeled as such is considered. Two main classes of techniques are described and evaluated: Network-based approaches and similarity based approaches. It is also explored how dividing the problem further by relabeling the data based on behavioral patterns can further improve the results},

abstract = {The properties of online social networks (OSNs) are of great interests to the general public as well as IT professionals. Often the raw data are not available and the summary released by the service providers are sketchy. Thus sampling is needed to reveal the hidden properties of the underlying data. While uniform random sampling is often preferred, some properties such as the top bloggers need to be obtained using PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling. Although PPS sampling can be approximated using simple random walk, it is not efficient because only one sample is taken in every step. This paper introduces an efficient sampling method, called star sampling, that takes all the neighbours as valid samples. It is more efficient than random walk sampling by a factor of the average degrees. We derive the estimator and its variance, and verify the result using six large real-networks locally where the ground-truth are known and the estimations can be evaluated.Then we apply our method on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, whose properties are rarely studied albeit its enormous size and influence. Along with other conventional metrics such as size and degree distributions, we demonstrate that star sampling can identify ten thousand top bloggers efficiently. In general, the estimated follower number is consistent with the claimed number, but there are cases where the follower numbers are inflated by a factor up to 132.},

However, the degree of complementarity of these methods has been very little studied. In this paper, we focus on two knowledge extraction processes in social networks: a link-based clustering that may extract social communities and a recent approach that searches for frequent conceptual link involving both clustering and search for frequent social patterns. We explore how the models extracted by each method may match and which potential useful knowledge they may provide. Our objective is to evaluate the potential relationships between communities and frequent conceptual links. For this purpose, we propose a set of measures for evaluating the degree to which these patterns extracted from the same dataset are matching. Our approach is applied on two datasets and demonstrates the importance of considering simultaneously various kinds of knowledge and their complementarity.},

Understanding the longevity of groups and the relevance of individuals within a group is important in many fields, including sociology, biology, economics, psychology, and political science. Different clustering algorithms have been proposed for static and dynamic graphs. However, using the clustering results to understand the changing dynamics of groups can be difficult. In order to better understand how groups evolve and the level of cohesion within these groups, we propose a holistic dynamic clustering framework that allows the user to adjust the underlying algorithms for clustering nodes in a graph that changes over time and then use the final clusters to produce a time hierarchy that highlights the groups and individuals persistent during different time periods. We test our framework and algorithm both on synthetic and real world data. Our findings indicate that our approach not only yields highly accurate results, but also detects unexpected variations in group structure.},

abstract = {The analysis and exploration of a social network depends on the type of relations at play. Borgatti had proposed a type taxonomy organizing relations in four possible categories. Homophily (similarity) relationships form an important category where relations occur when entities of the network link whenever they exhibit similar behaviors. Examples are networks of coauthor, where homophily between two persons follows from co-authorship; or network of actors having played under the supervision of the same movie director, for instance. Homophily is often embodied through a bipartite network where entities of a given type A (authors, movie directors) connect through entities of a different type B (papers, actors). A common strategy is then to project this bipartite graph onto a single-type network with entities of a same type A, possibly weighting edges based on how the type A entities interact with the type B entities underlying the edge. The resulting single-type network can then be studied using standard techniques such as community detection using edge density, or the computation of various centrality indices. This paper revisits this type of approach and introduces a homogeneity measure inspired form past work by Burt. Two entities of type B interact when they both induce a same edge between two entities of type A. The homogeneity of a subgroup thus depends on how intensely and how equally interactions occur between entities of type B giving rise to the subgroup. The measure thus differentiates between subgroups of type A exhibiting similar topologies depending on the interaction patterns of the underlying entities of type B. The method is validated using two widely used datasets. A first example looks at authors of the IEEE InfoVis Conference (InfoVis 2007 Contest). A second example looks at homophily relations between movie actors that have played under the direction of a same director (IMDB).},

Additionally, we observe a strong positive correlation between the predictive accuracy of our group cohesion-based approaches and the duration of playing time between a particular configuration of players on a team and their opponents, or "match-up" length.},

abstract = {Models and techniques for the extraction and analysis of communities from social network data have become a major area of research. Most of the prominent approaches exploit the link structure among users based on, e.g., information about followers or the exchange of messages among users. However, there are also other types of information that are useful for extracting communities from social network data, such as geographic information associated with postings and users. In this paper, we present a novel approach to discover so-called regional communities. Motivated by the fact that more and more postings to social networks include the geo-location of users, we claim that communities also form even if their users do not necessarily interact but are posting (similar) messages in both spatial and temporal proximity. To discover such regional communities we propose a generative probabilistic model based on spatial latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA) that unveils not only regional communities but also topics associated with these communities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Twitter data and compare the properties of communities detected that way with communities discovered by approaches using link graphs.},

Mothers have certainly not been foreign to this development. Many have embraced the new technology to share experiences, thoughts, current events, reactions, and tips with their peers. Recognizing the role of mothers as decision-makers in their families, especially in the context of health, we focus our attention on "mommy-communities" in Twitter and the blogosphere. We consider what health topics are discussed by mothers in these communities, identify and compare implicit affinities to explicit links, and highlight differences and similarities across the two social media platforms.},

Modeling information diffusion through a network can enable us to reach a superior functional understanding of the effect of network structures such as communities on information propagation. The intrinsic assumption is that form follows function---rational actors exercise social choice mechanisms to join communities that best serve their information needs. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was originally designed to simulate aggregate social behavior; our proposed diffusion model, PSODM (Particle Swarm Optimization Diffusion Model) models information flow in a network by creating particle swarms for local network neighborhoods that optimize a continuous version of Holland's hyperplane-defined objective functions. In this paper, we show how our approach differs from prior modeling work in the area and demonstrate that it outperforms existing model-based community detection methods on several social network datasets.},

We give particular emphasis to the role information about the pay-offs of neighbours plays in nodes adapting strategies, by limiting this information up to various levels. We find that if nodes have no chance to evolutionarily adapt, then non-coordination is a better strategy, however when nodes adapt based on information of the neighbour payoffs, coordination quickly emerges as the better strategy. We find phase transitions in number of coordinators with respect to the relative pay-off of coordination, and these phase transitions are sharper in small-world networks. We also find that when pay-off information of neighbours is limited, small-world networks are able to better cope with this limitation than scale-free networks. We observe that provincial hubs are the quickest to evolutionarily adapt strategies, in both scale-free and small world networks. Our findings confirm that evolutionary tendencies of coordination heavily depend on network topology.},

abstract = {Information propagation in a microblog network aims to identify a set of seed users for propagating a target message to as many interested users as possible. This problem differs from the traditional influence maximization in two major ways: it has a content-rich target message for propagation and it treats each link in the network as communication on certain topics and emphasizes the topic relevance of such communication in propagating the target message. In realistic situations, however, the topics associated with a link are not explicitly expressed but are hidden in the microblogs previously exchanged through the link. In this paper, we present a topic-aware solution to information propagation in a microblog network. We first model the latent topic structure of the network using observed microblog messages published in the network. We then present two methods for estimating the propagation probability based on the topic relevance between a link and the target message. Once the propagation probability is estimated, we adopt the standard greedy algorithm for influence maximization to find seed users. This approach is topic-aware in that the target message finds its way of propagation according to its topic relevance to the latent topic structure in the network. Experiments conducted on real Twitter datasets suggest that the proposed methods are able to select right seed users.},

We have chosen a multi-agent framework perspective for this simulation. We endow the agents with simple rules on how to move around the space and how to establish proximity-contacts. This allows to distinguish different kinds of mobile agents, from sedentary ones to travelers. To summarize the dynamics induced by mobility over time, we define the mobility-based Social Proximity Network as being the network of all distinct contacts between agents. Its properties give insight in the process of information spreading. We conduct simulations to understand how an information can be broadcast when agent-nodes are in motion.},

abstract = {Diffusion phenomena occur in many kinds of real-world complex networks, e.g., biological, information or social networks. Because of this diversity, several types of diffusion models have been proposed in the literature: epidemiological models, threshold models, innovation adoption models, among others. Many studies aim at investigating diffusion as an evolving phenomenon but mostly occurring on static networks, and much remains to be done to understand diffusion on evolving networks. In order to study the impact of graph dynamics on diffusion, we propose in this paper an innovative approach based on a notion of intrinsic time, where the time unit corresponds to the appearance of a new link in the graph. This original notion of time allows us to isolate somehow the diffusion phenomenon from the evolution of the network. The objective is to compare the diffusion features observed with this intrinsic time concept from those obtained with traditional (extrinsic) time, based on seconds. The comparison of these time concepts is easily understandable yet completely new in the study of diffusion phenomena. We experiment our approach on synthetic graphs, as well as on a dataset extracted from the Github sofware sharing platform.},

abstract = {Probably the major approach to making predictions or recommendations about user behavior is by pairing unambiguous indicators of preference with attributes of the users who have given those indications. However, since the necessary preference data is often difficult to obtain, it is considered very valuable and often held closely by vendors and advertisers. On the other hand, while Twitter and other social media platforms provide a wealth of data about users by way of what they say or tweet, who or what they like or follow, etc., little work has been done to combine these data with indicators of preference for purposes of prediction or recommendation. In this paper we present a novel approach to mining preference data from natural language expressions in social media, which are then extrapolated to other individuals whose preferences are not known through predictive modeling. As an application for this approach, we describe the implementation of Tweetcast Your Vote, a publicly accessible system that predicted the voting decisions of Twitter users in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.},

abstract = {The massive presence of silent members in online communities, the so-called lurkers, has long attracted the attention of researchers in social science, cognitive psychology, and computer-human interaction. However, the study of lurking phenomena represents an unexplored opportunity of research in data mining, information retrieval and related fields. In this paper, we take a first step towards the formal specification and analysis of lurking in social networks. Particularly, focusing on the network topology, we address the new problem of lurker ranking and propose the first centrality methods specifically conceived for ranking lurkers in social networks. Using Twitter and FriendFeed as cases in point, our methods' performance was evaluated against data-driven rankings as well as existing centrality methods, including the classic PageRank and alpha-centrality. Empirical evidence has shown the significance of our lurker ranking approach, which substantially differs from other methods in effectively identifying and ranking lurkers.},

abstract = {Social media has become a popular platform that connects people who share information, in particular personal opinions. Through such a fast information exchange mechanism, reputation of individuals, consumer products, or business companies can be quickly built up within a social network. Recently, applications mining social network data start emerging to find the communities sharing the same interests for marketing purposes. Knowing the reputation of social network entities, such as celebrities or business companies, can help develop better strategies for election campaigns or new product advertisements. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to collectively measure reputations of entities in social networks. By collecting and analyzing large amount of user activities on Facebook, our model can effectively and efficiently rank entities, such as presidential candidates, professional sport teams, musician bands, and companies, based on their social reputation. The proposed model produces results largely consistent with the two publicly available systems - movie ranking in Internet Movie Database and business school ranking by the US news &amp; World Report - with the correlation coefficients of 0.75 and -0.71, respectively.},

abstract = {Information propagation in social media depends not only on the static follower structure but also on the topic-specific user behavior. Hence novel models incorporating dynamic user behavior are needed. To this end, we propose a model for individual social media users, termed a genotype. The genotype is a per-topic summary of a user's interest, activity and susceptibility to adopt new information. We demonstrate that user genotypes remain invariant within a topic by adopting them for classification of new information spread in large-scale real networks. Furthermore, we extract topic-specific influence backbone structures based on information adoption and show that they differ significantly from the static follower network. When employed for influence prediction of new content spread, our genotype model and influence backbones enable more than 20% improvement, compared to purely structural features. We also demonstrate that knowledge of user genotypes and influence backbones allow for the design of effective strategies for latency minimization of topic-specific information spread.},

abstract = {Analyzing and modeling network data have become increasingly important in a wide range of scientific fields. Among popular models, exponential random graph models (ERGM) have been developed to study these complex networks. For large networks, however, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters in these models can be very difficult, due to the unknown normalizing constant. Alternative strategies based on Markov chain Monte Carlo draw samples to approximate the likelihood, which is then maximized to obtain the MLE. These strategies have poor convergence due to model degeneracy issues. Chatterjee and Diaconis [1] propose a new theoretical framework for estimating the parameters of ERGM by approximating the normalizing constant using the emerging tools in graph theory---graph limits. In this paper, we construct a complete computational procedure built upon their results with practical innovations. More specifically, we evaluate the likelihood via simple function approximation of the corresponding ERGM's graph limit and iteratively maximize the likelihood to obtain the MLE. We also propose a new matching method to find a starting point for our iterative algorithm. Through simulation study and real data analysis of two large social networks, we show that our new method outperforms the MCMC-based method, especially when the network size is large (more than 100 nodes).},

abstract = {Degree peeling is used to study complex networks. It corresponds to a decomposition of the graph into vertex groups of increasing minimum degree. However, the peeling value of a vertex is non-local in this context since it relies on the connections the vertex has to groups above it. We explore a different way to decompose a network into edge layers such that the local peeling value of the vertices on each layer does not depend on their non-local connections with the other layers. This corresponds to the decomposition of a graph into subgraphs that are invariant with respect to degree peeling, i.e. they are fixed points. We introduce in this context a method to partition the edges of a graph into fixed points of degree peeling, called the iterative-edge-core decomposition. Information from this decomposition is used to formulate a notion of vertex diversity based on Shannon's entropy. We illustrate the usefulness of this decomposition in social network analysis. Our method can be used for community detection and graph visualization.},

In this paper we try to improve a class of algorithms available for this purpose, namely network-centric algorithms, which are based upon the enumeration of all sets of k connected nodes. Past approaches would essentially delay isomorphism tests until they had a finalized set of k nodes. In this paper we show how isomorphism testing can be done during the actual enumeration. We use a customized g-trie, a tree data structure, in order to encapsulate the topological information of the embedded subgraphs, identifying already known node permutations of the same subgraph type. With this we avoid redundancy and the need of an isomorphism test for each subgraph occurrence. We tested our algorithm, which we called FaSE, on a set of different real complex networks, both directed and undirected, showcasing that we indeed achieve significant speedups of at least one order of magnitude against past algorithms, paving the way for a faster network-centric approach.},

In this paper, we study the notion of consensual communities and show that they do not exist in random graphs. For that, we exhibit a phase transition based on the strength of consensus: below a given threshold, all the nodes belongs to the same consensual community; above this threshold, each node is in its own consensual community.},

As social media becomes a more and more prevalent way of receiving political information, it becomes important to understand more completely the interaction between information, emotion, social community, and information-sharing behavior. In this paper, we describe a high-precision classifier for politically-oriented tweets, and an accurate classifier of a Twitter user's political affiliation. Coupled with existing sentiment-analysis tools for microblogs, these methods enable us to systematically study the interaction of emotion and sharing in a large corpus of politically-oriented microblog messages, collected from just before the 2012 US presidential election. In particular, we seek to understand how information sharing is influenced by the political affiliation of the sender and receiver of a message, and the sentiment associated with the message.},

abstract = {We use public data from Twitter, both in English and Arabic, to study the phenomenon of secular vs. Islamist polarization in Twitter. Starting with a set of prominent seed Twitter users from both camps, we follow retweeting edges to obtain an extended network of users with inferred political orientation. We present an in-depth description of the members of the two camps, both in terms of behavior on Twitter and in terms of offline characteristics such as gender. Through the identification of partisan users, we compute a valence on the secular vs. Islamist axis for hashtags and use this information both to analyze topical interests and to quantify how polarized society as a whole is at a given point in time. For the last 12 months, large values on this "polarization barometer" coincided with periods of violence. Tweets are furthermore annotated using hand-crafted dictionaries to quantify the usage of (i) religious terms, (ii) derogatory terms referring to other religions, and (ii) references to charitable acts. The combination of all the information allows us to test and quantify a number of stereo-typical hypotheses such as (i) that religiosity and political Islamism are correlated, (ii) that political Islamism and negative views on other religions are linked, (iii) that religiosity goes hand in hand with charitable giving, and (iv) that the followers of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood are more tightly connected and expressing themselves "in unison" than the secular opposition. Whereas a lot of existing literature on the Arab Spring and the Egyptian Revolution is largely of qualitative and descriptive nature, our contribution lies in providing a quantitative and data-driven analysis of online communication in this dynamic and politically charged part of the world.},

A language model for each party is learned from the content of the tweets by the party candidates, and the preference of a user is assessed based on the alignment of user tweets with the language models of the parties. We evaluate our work in the context of Alberta 2012 general election, and show that our model outperforms, in terms of the F-measure, sentiment and text classification approaches and is in par with the human annotators. We further use our model to analyze the preference changes over the course of the election campaign and report results that would be difficult to attain by human annotators.},

The automatic identification of chatter tweets is critical for tasks such as ranking tweets by relevance, matching tweets to advertisements, creation of topical digests of tweets, etc. and generally improves the utility of tweets to people outside the producers' immediate network by enabling the filtering out of tweets that are not of wider interest.

We then propose an adaptive crawling model that detects emerging popular hashtags, and monitors them to retrieve greater amounts of highly associated data for events of interest. The proposed model analyzes the traffic patterns of the hashtags collected from the live stream to update subsequent collection queries. To evaluate this adaptive crawling model, we apply it to a dataset collected during the 2012 London Olympic Games.

Dynamic social network analysis aims to understand the structures in networks as they evolve, building on static analysis techniques but including variation. Working directly with the graphs that represent social networks is difficult, and it has become common to use spectral techniques that embed graphs in a geometry and then work with the geometry instead. We extend such spectral techniques to dynamically changing data by binding network snapshots at different times into a single directed graph structure in a way that keeps structures aligned. This global network can then be embedded. Pairwise similarity, as well as community and cluster structures can be tracked over time, and the idea of the trajectory of a node across time becomes meaningful. We illustrate the approach using a real-world dataset, the Caviar drug-trafficking network.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a new methodology for gaining insight into the temporal aspects of social networks. In order to develop higher-level, large-scale data analysis methods for classification, prediction, and anomaly detection, a solid foundation of analytical techniques is required. We present a novel approach to the analysis of these networks that leverages time series and statistical techniques to quantitatively describe the temporal nature of a social network. We report on the application of our approach toward a real data set and successfully visualize high-level changes to the network as well as discover outlying vertices.The real-time prediction of new connections given the previous connections in a graph is a notoriously difficult task. The proposed technique avoids this difficulty by modeling statistics computed from the graph over time. Vertex statistics summarize topological information as real numbers, which allows us to leverage the existing fields of computational statistics and machine learning. This creates a modular approach to analysis in which methods can be developed that are agnostic to the metrics and algorithms used to process the graph.We demonstrate these techniques using a collection of Twitter posts related to Hurricane Sandy. We study the temporal nature of betweenness centrality and clustering coefficients while producing multiple visualizations of a social network dataset with 1.2 million edges. We successfully detect vertices whose triangle-forming behavior is anomalous.},

abstract = {This paper focuses primarily on the Person Successor Problem (PSP): when a terrorist is removed from a terrorist network, who is most likely to take his place? We leverage the solution to PSP to predict a new terrorist network after removal of a set of terrorists and to answer the question: which set of k (k &gt; 0) terrorists should be removed in order to minimize the lethality of the terrorist network? We propose a theoretical model to study these questions taking into account the fact that terrorists may have different individual capabilities. We develop an algorithm for PSP in which analysts can specify the conditions an individual needs to satisfy in order to replace another person. We test the correctness of our algorithm on a real-world partial network dataset for two terrorist groups: Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba where we have ground truth about who replaced who, as well as a synthetic dataset where experts estimate who replaced who. Building on the solution to PSP, we develop an algorithm to identify which set of k people to remove from a terrorist network to minimize the organization's efficiency (formalized as an objective function in some different ways).},

abstract = {Social networks are driven by social interaction and therefore dynamic. When modeled as a graph, nodes and links are continually added and deleted, and there is considerable interest in social network analysis on predicting link formation. Current work has not adequately addressed three issues:(1) Most link predictors start with using features from the link topology as input. How do features in other dimensions of the social network data affect link formation? (2) The dynamic nature of social networks implies the features driving link formation are constantly changing. How can a predictor automatically select the features that are important for link formation? (3) Node pairs that are not linked can outnumber links by orders of magnitude, but previous work do not address this imbalance. How can we design a predictor that is robust with respect to link imbalance?This paper presents sonLP, a social network link predictor. It uses principal component analysis to identify features that are important to link prediction, its tradeoff between true and false positives is near optimal for a wide range of link imbalance, and it has optimal time complexity. Experiments with coauthorship prediction in the ACM researcher community also show the importance of using features outside the links' dimension.},

In this paper we analyzed tie strength defined as partners and acquaintances in two domains: a location-based social network and an online social network (Second Life). We compared user pairs in terms of their partnership and found significant differences between partners and acquaintances. Following these observations, we evaluated the social proximity of users via supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and established that homophilic features were most valuable for the prediction of partnership.},

abstract = {The understanding of how humans move is a longstanding challenge in the natural science. An important question is, to what degree is human behavior predictable? The ability to foresee the mobility of humans is crucial from predicting the spread of human to urban planning. Previous research has focused on predicting individual mobility behavior, such as the next location prediction problem. In this paper we study the human mobility behaviors from the perspective of network science. In the human mobility network, there will be a link between two humans if they are physically proximal to each other. We perform both microscopic and macroscopic explorations on the human mobility patterns. From the microscopic perspective, our objective is to answer whether two humans will be in proximity of each other or not. While from the macroscopic perspective, we are interested in whether we can infer the future topology of the human mobility network. In this paper we explore both problems by using link prediction technology, our methodology is demonstrated to have a greater degree of precision in predicting future mobility topology.},

Our study examines how feedback with different opinions is associated with participants' lifetime in online newsgroups. Firstly, we propose a new method of classifying different opinions among user interaction contents. Generally, we leverage user behavior information in online newsgroups to estimate their opinions and evaluate our classification results based on linguistic features. In addition, we also implement this opinion classification method into our SINCERE system as a real-time service. Based on this opinion classification tool, we use survival analysis to examine how others' feedback with different opinions influence continued participation. In our experiment, we analyze more than 88,770 interactions on the official Occupy LA Facebook page. Our final result shows that not only the feedback with the same opinions as the user, but also the feedback with different opinions can motivate continued user participation in online newsgroup. Furthermore, an interaction of feedback with both the same and different opinions can boost user continued participation to the greatest extent. This finding forms the basis of understanding how to improve online service in social media.},

abstract = {The study of influence, persuasion, and user sentiment dynamics within online communities has recently emerged as a highly active area of research. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and modeling user sentiment dynamics within a real-world social media such as Twitter. Beyond text and connectivity, we are interested in exploring the level of topical user posting activity and its effect on sentiment change. We perform topic-wise analysis of tweeting behavior that reveals a strong relationship between users' activity acceleration and topic sentiment change. Inspired by this empirical observation, we develop a new generative and predictive model that extends classical neighborhood-based influence propagation with the notion of user activation. We fit the parameters of our model to a large, real-world Twitter dataset and evaluate its utility to predict future sentiment change. Our model outperforms significantly (1 order of magnitude in accuracy) existing alternatives in identifying the individuals who are most likely to change sentiment based on past information. When predicting the next sentiment of users who actually change their opinion (a relatively rare event), our model is twice more accurate than alternatives, while its overall network accuracy is 94% on average. We also study the effect of inactive users on consensus efficiency in the opinion dynamics process both analytically and in simulation within the context of our model.},

The basic principle is based on the observation that positive texts are statistically shorter than negative ones. From this observation of the psycholinguistic human behavior, we derive a heuristic that is employed to generate connoted lexicons with a low level of prior knowledge. The lexicon is then used to compute the level of opinion of an unknown text. Our primary goal is to reduce the need of the human implication (domain and language) in the generation of the lexicon in order to have a process with the highest possible autonomy. The resulting adaptability would represent an advantage with free or approximate expression commonly found in social networks environment.},

More specifically, we formulate the informative-sentence selection problem in opinion summarization as a community-leader detection problem, where a community consists of a cluster of sentences towards the same aspect of an entity. The detected leaders of the communities can be considered as the most informative sentences of the corresponding aspect, while informativeness of a sentence is defined by its informativeness within both its community and the document it belongs to. Review data from six product domains from Amazon.com are used to verify the effectiveness of our method for opinion summarization.},

However, there has been little work focusing on identifying the polarity of sentiments expressed by users in online health communities such as cancer support forums, etc. Online health communities act as a medium through which people share their health concerns with fellow members of the community and get social support. Identifying sentiments expressed by members in a health community can be helpful in understanding dynamics of the community such as dominant health issues, emotional impacts of interactions on members, etc. In this work, we perform sentiment classification of user posts in an online cancer support community (Cancer Survivors Network). We use Domain-dependent and Domain-independent sentiment features as the two complementary views of a post and use them for post classification in a semi-supervised setting using the co-training algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our methods.},

abstract = {We examine whether the prominence of individuals in different social networks is determined by their position in their local network or by how the community to which they belong relates to other communities. To this end, we introduce two new measures of centrality, both based on communities in the network: local and community centrality. Community centrality is a novel concept that we introduce to describe how central one's community is within the whole network. We introduce an algorithm to estimate the distance between communities and use it to find the centrality of communities. Using data from several social networks, we show that community centrality is able to capture the importance of communities in the whole network. We then conduct a detailed study of different social networks and determine how various global measures of prominence relate to structural centrality measures. Our measures deconstruct global centrality along local and community dimensions. In some cases, prominence is determined almost exclusively by local information, while in others a mix of local and community centrality matters. Our methodology is a step toward understanding of the processes that contribute to an actor's prominence in a network.},

abstract = {Study of community in time-varying graphs has been limited to its detection and identification across time. However, presence of time provides us with the opportunity to analyze the interaction patterns of the communities, understand how each individual community grows/shrinks, becomes important over time. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies the temporal interaction patterns of communities using a large scale citation network (directed and unweighted) of computer science. Each individual community in a citation network is naturally defined by a research field -- i.e., acting as ground-truth -- and their interactions through citations in real time can unfold the landscape of dynamic research trends in the computer science domain over the last fifty years. These interactions are quantified in terms of a metric called inwardness that captures the effect of local citations to express the degree of authoritativeness of a community (research field) at a particular time instance. Several arguments to unveil the reasons behind the temporal changes of inwardness of different communities are put forward using exhaustive statistical analysis. The measurements (importance of field) are compared with the project funding statistics of NSF and it is found that the two are in sync. We believe that this measurement study with a large real-world data is an important initial step towards understanding the dynamics of cluster-interactions in a temporal environment. Note that this paper, for the first time, systematically outlines a new avenue of research that one can practice post community detection.},

abstract = {Finding talents, often among the people already hired, is an endemic challenge for organizations. The social networking revolution, with online tools like Linkedin, made possible to make explicit and accessible what we perceived, but not used, for thousands of years: the exact position and ranking of a person in a network of professional and personal connections. To search and mine where and how an employee is positioned on a global skill network will enable organizations to find unpredictable sources of knowledge, innovation and know-how. This data richness and hidden knowledge demands for a multidimensional and multiskill approach to the network ranking problem. Multidimensional networks are networks with multiple kinds of relations. To the best of our knowledge, no network-based ranking algorithm is able to handle multidimensional networks and multiple rankings over multiple attributes at the same time. In this paper we propose such an algorithm, whose aim is to address the node multi-ranking problem in multidimensional networks. We test our algorithm over several real world networks, extracted from DBLP and the Enron email corpus, and we show its usefulness in providing less trivial and more flexible rankings than the current state of the art algorithms.},

abstract = {Discovering similar objects in a social network has many interesting issues. Here, we present ASCOS, an Asymmetric Structure COntext Similarity measure that captures the similarity scores among any pairs of nodes in a network. The definition of ASCOS is similar to that of the well-known SimRank since both define score values recursively. However, we show that ASCOS outputs a more complete similarity score than SimRank because SimRank (and several of its variations, such as P-Rank and SimFusion) on average ignores half paths between nodes during calculation. To make ASCOS tractable in both computation time and memory usage, we propose two variations of ASCOS: a low rank approximation based approach and an iterative solver Gauss-Seidel for linear equations. When the target network is sparse, the run time and the required computing space of these variations are smaller than computing SimRank and ASCOS directly. In addition, the iterative solver divides the original network into several independent sub-systems so that a multi-core server or a distributed computing environment, such as MapReduce, can efficiently solve the problem. We compare the performance of ASCOS with other global structure based similarity measures, including SimRank, Katz, and LHN. The experimental results based on user evaluation suggest that ASCOS gives better results than other measures. In addition, the asymmetric property has the potential to identify the hierarchical structure of a network. Finally, variations of ASCOS (including one distributed variation) can also reduce computation both in space and time.},

abstract = {In an emerging trend, more and more Internet users search for information from Community Question and Answer (CQA) websites, as interactive communication in such websites provides users with a rare feeling of trust. More often than not, end users look for instant help when they browse the CQA websites for the best answers. Hence, it is imperative that they should be warned of any potential commercial campaigns hidden behind the answers. Existing research focuses more on the quality of answers and does not meet the above need. Textual similarities between questions and answers are widely used in previous research. However, this feature will no longer be effective when facing commercial paid posters. More context information, such as writing templates and a user's reputation track need to be combined together to form a new model to detect the potential campaign answers. In this paper, we develop a system that automatically analyzes the hidden patterns of commercial spam and raises alarms instantaneously to end users whenever a potential commercial campaign is detected. Our detection method integrates semantic analysis and posters' track records and utilizes the special features of CQA websites largely different from those in other types of forums such as microblogs or news reports. Our system is adaptive and accommodates new evidence uncovered by the detection algorithms over time. Validated with real-world trace data from a popular Chinese CQA website over a period of three months, our system shows great potential towards adaptive online detection of CQA spams.},

abstract = {Sybil attacks in social and information systems have serious security implications. Out of many defence schemes, Graph-based Sybil Detection (GSD) had the greatest attention by both academia and industry. Even though many GSD algorithms exist, there is no analytical framework to reason about their design, especially as they make different assumptions about the used adversary and graph models. In this paper, we bridge this knowledge gap and present a unified framework for systematic evaluation of GSD algorithms. We used this framework to show that GSD algorithms should be designed to find local community structures around known non-Sybil identities, while incrementally tracking changes in the graph as it evolves over time.},

abstract = {Social media is inarguably a powerful medium for mobilizing support for various real-life events be it for social, political, or economic transformation. Further, in contrast to the generic information obtained from the mainstream media, novel and specific information available at social media sites makes them valuable sources for event analysis. However, due to the power law distribution of the Internet, these overwhelmingly large number of sources are buried in the Long Tail making it extremely challenging to identify the quality sources among them. In this research, we propose an evolutionary mutual reinforcement model to confront these challenges. Due to absence of ground truth, a novel evaluation strategy is introduced. The results indicate tremendous potential. 25% to 130% information gain is obtained with the proposed approach when compared against the state-of-the-art baselines, viz. Google blog search and Icerocket blog search. Further, our ranking methodology is capable of identifying the highly informative sources much earlier than the aforementioned baselines. The proposed model affords an apparatus for micro and macro event analysis.},

abstract = {Social network data provide valuable information for companies to better understand the characteristics of their potential customers with respect to their communities. Yet, sharing social network data in its raw form raises serious privacy concerns because a successful privacy attack not only compromises the sensitive information of the target victim but also the relationship with his/her friends or even their private information. In recent years, several anonymization techniques have been proposed to solve these issues. Most of them focus on how to achieve a given privacy model but fail to preserve the data mining knowledge required for data recipients. In this paper, we propose a method to k-anonymize a social network dataset with the goal of preserving frequent sharing patterns, one of the most important kinds of knowledge required for marketing and consumer behaviour analysis. Experimental results on real-life data illustrate the trade-off between privacy and utility loss with respect to the preservation of frequent sharing patterns.},

In this paper we justify the existence of the social influence by considering the temporal behavior of Last.fm users. In order to clearly distinguish between friends sharing the same interest, especially since Last.fm recommends friends based on similarity of taste, we separated the timeless effect of similar taste from the temporal impulses of immediately listening to the same artist after a friend. We measured strong increase of listening to a completely new artist in a few hours period after a friend compared to non-friends representing a simple trend or external influence. In our experiment to eliminate network independent elements of taste, we improved collaborative filtering and trend based methods by blending with simple time aware recommendations based on the influence of friends. Our experiments are carried over the two-year "scrobble" history of 70,000 Last.fm users.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) service enables its users to exchange knowledge in the form of questions and answers. By allowing the users to contribute knowledge, CQA not only satisfies the question askers but also provides valuable references to other users with similar queries. Due to a large volume of questions, not all questions get fully answered. As a result, it can be useful to route a question to a potential answerer. In this paper, we present a question routing scheme which takes into account the answering, commenting and voting propensities of the users. Unlike prior work which focuses on routing a question to the most desirable expert, we focus on routing it to a group of users - who would be willing to collaborate and provide useful answers to that question. Through empirical evidence, we show that more answers and comments are desirable for improving the lasting value of a question-answer thread. As a result, our focus is on routing a question to a team of compatible users. We propose a recommendation model that takes into account the compatibility, topical expertise and availability of the users. Our experiments over a large real-world dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach over several baseline models.},

abstract = {Empirical social networks are often aggregate proxies for several heterogeneous relations. In online social networks, for instance, interactions related to friendship, kinship, business, interests, and other relationships may all be represented as catchall "friendships." Because several relations are mingled into one, the resulting networks exhibit relatively high and uniform density. As a consequence, the variation in positional differences and local cohesion may be too small for reliable analysis.We introduce a method to identify the essential relationships in networks representing social interactions. Our method is based on a novel concept of triadic cohesion that is motivated by Simmel's concept of membership in social groups. We demonstrate that our Simmelian backbones are capable of extracting structure from Facebook interaction networks that makes them easy to visualize and analyze. Since all computations are local, the method can be restricted to partial networks such as ego networks, and scales to big data.},

Network motifs have been shown effective for characterizing the structural properties of such complex networks. Nevertheless, related motif models typically do not consider stochastic structural and sequential variations, hinting their limitations on dynamic network analysis. In this paper, we consider networks with time-stamped edges and model their local structural and temporal variations using a mixture of Markov chains for stochastic temporal network motif detection. The optimal number of motifs is automatically estimated in a Bayesian framework. We evaluated the proposed method using synthetic networks and found to be robust against noise compared to the deterministic approach. Also, we applied it to a mobile phone usage data set to demonstrate how the human communication patterns embedded in the data set can be detected. In addition, we make use of a hidden Markov model with different distributions for the mixing proportions of the motifs defining its states, and demonstrated how the evolution of the communication patterns can also be identified.},

Usable approaches for managing large amounts of objects, in the form of privacy information and content, have lagged. We introduce two approaches for object management. We extend our previous work to accommodate for object grouping and we introduce Same-As Object Management, which provides for a more usable object management approach that is effective, efficient and satisfying to the user. Same-As Object Management leverages a user's memory and perception of their objects for setting permissions for other similar objects.

abstract = {The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming data.},

Therefore, a low cost alternative is of great practical use. As a platform used by over 500 million users worldwide to publish their ideas about many topics, including health conditions, Twitter provides researchers the freshest source of public health conditions on a global scale. We propose a framework for tracking public health condition trends via Twitter. The basic idea is to use frequent term sets from highly purified health-related tweets as queries into a Wikipedia article index -- treating the retrieval of medically-related articles as an indicator of a health-related condition. By observing fluctuations in frequent term sets and in turn medically-related articles over a series of time slices of tweets, we detect shifts in public health conditions and concerns over time. Compared to existing approaches, our framework provides a general a priori identification of emerging public health conditions rather than a specific illness (e.g., influenza) as is commonly done.},

As a person's social network grows, friend management is increasingly important for effective communications. Often, one can only afford to maintain close friendship in a small scale due to limited time and other resources. In other words, the majority of one's connections are so-so friends and do not hold strong influence on the user. One approach resorts to network denoising, by which unimportant connections are removed as noise. We study the challenges of network denoising in social media and how we can leverage a variety of social media information to denoise the links. We formulate the network denoising task as an optimization problem, and show the efficacy of our network denoising approach and its scalability experimentally in the domain of behavior inference.},

We then propose an efficient algorithm to detect change points by maximizing the likelihood of generating the observed sequence data, which has time complexity almost proportional to the length of observed sequence (possible change points). We experimentally evaluate the method on synthetic data streams and demonstrate the importance of considering both distributions to improve the accuracy. We, further, apply our method to real scoring stream data extracted from a Japanese word-of-mouth communication site for cosmetics and show that it can detect change points and the detected parameter change patterns are interpretable through an in-depth investigation of actual reviews.},

Millions of Web-users are able to leverage these platforms to submit, view and discuss nearly anything. The users themselves exclusively curate the content with an intricate system of submissions, voting and discussion. Furthermore, the data on social news Web sites is extremely well organized by its user-base, which opens the door for opportunities to leverage this data for other purposes just like Wikipedia data has been used for many other purposes. In this paper we study a popular social news Web site called Reddit. Our investigation looks at the dynamics of its discussion threads, and asks two main questions: (1) to what extent do discussion threads resemble a topical hierarchy? and (2) Can discussion threads be used to enhance Web search? We show interesting results for these questions on a very large snapshot several sub-communities of the Reddit Web site. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results and suggest ways by which social news Web site's can be used to perform other tasks.},

In our work, we propose a simple yet effective model to predict the behavior of a user - in terms of which hashtag or named entity he might include in his future tweets. We have approached the problem as a classification task with the various influences contributing as features. Further, we analyze the contribution of the weights of the different features.

We hypothesize and show that players with high social capital are often key influencers in the network. We propose a value-allocation model to compute the social capital and allocate the fair share of this capital to each individual involved in the collaboration. We show that our allocation satisfies several axioms of fairness and falls in the same class as the Myerson's allocation function. We implement our allocation rule using an efficient algorithm SoCap and show that our algorithm outperforms the baselines in several real-life data sets. Specifically, in DBLP network, our algorithm outperforms PageRank, PMIA and Weighted Degree baselines up to 8% in terms of precision, recall and F1-measure.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to better understand social influence in online social media. Therefore, we propose a method in which we implement, validate and improve an individual behavior model. The behavior model is based on three fundamental behavioral principles of social influence from the literature: 1) liking, 2) social proof and 3) consistency. We have implemented the model using an agent-based modeling approach. The multi-agent model contains the social network structure, individual behavior parameters and the scenario that are obtained from empirical data. The model is validated by comparing the output of the multi-agent simulation with empirical data. We demonstrate the method by evaluating five versions of behavior models applied to the use case of Twitter behavior about a talent show on Dutch television.},

abstract = {The emergence of social media has created new ways to publish scientific work, foster collaboration, and build professional connections in the research community. The rich data collected in social media platforms has provided new opportunities for assessing scholars' impact other than the traditional citation-based approach. In this paper, we investigate the measures of scholars' influence in academic social media platforms, taking both academic and social impact into account. A real-life dataset collected from Mendeley is used to apply different influence metrics. We first assess the academic influence of scholars based on the scientific impact of their publications using three different measures. Then we investigate their social influence using network centrality metrics. The experiments show that top influencers with high academic impact tend to be senior scholars with many coauthors. Furthermore, academic influence and social influence measures do not strongly correlate with each other, and thus scholars with high academic impact are not necessarily influential from a social point of view. Adding the social dimension could enhance the traditional impact metrics that only take academic influence into account.},

We consider bidirectional interactions from perspectives of followees and followers, and measure the interactive degree by four factors comprised of retweeting strength, commenting intensity, mentioning density and a special indicator to the potential interactions called keyword similarity.

Selecting the right content according to the information context and the user characteristics is essential for achieving this goal. We propose a model to automatically choose which information to publish on social networks given a set of possible messages. This model will tend to maximize the spread of the published message for a specific audience. The algorithm is based on the use of a contextual bandit model treating each new potential message as an arm to be selected. We conduct experiments on a Twitter dataset, comparing different algorithms and exploring the influence of the content and the characteristics of the messages on the information spread. The results demonstrate the model's ability to maximize the published information flow as well as it's ability to adapt its behavior to each particular audience.},

abstract = {In the context of collaborative filtering, the well-known data sparsity issue makes two like-minded users have little similarity, and consequently renders the k nearest neighbour rule inapplicable. In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in the neighbourhood-based CF methods by proposing an Adaptive-Maximum imputation method (AdaM). The basic idea is to identify an imputation area that can maximize the imputation benefit for recommendation purposes, while minimizing the imputation error brought in. To achieve the maximum imputation benefit, the imputation area is determined from both the user and the item perspectives; to minimize the imputation error, there is at least one real rating preserved for each item in the identified imputation area. A theoretical analysis is provided to prove that the proposed imputation method outperforms the conventional neighbourhood-based CF methods through more accurate neighbour identification. Experiment results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other related state-of-the-art imputation-based methods in terms of accuracy.},

In this paper, we identify three important properties that an academic recommendation service could provide for better literature search: personalization, scalability, and exploratory search. With these objectives in mind, we present a web service called theadvisor which helps the users build a strong bibliography by extending the document set obtained after a first-level search. Along with an efficient and personalized recommendation algorithm, the service also features result diversification, relevance feedback, visualization for exploratory search. We explain the design criteria and rationale we employed to make the theadvisor a useful and scalable web service with a thorough evaluation.},

abstract = {Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), (also called as Geo-Social Networks), has been attracting more and more users by providing services that integrate social activities with location information. LBSN systems usually provide support for indicating various Points of Interest (POIs) but there is no straightforward rating mechanism for POIs in most LBSNs [1]. POI recommendations in LBSNs, thus, is an important and challenging research topic. In this paper, we first investigate the dataset crawled from Foursquare to explore the features that attract and influence users to check in at various POIs. Based on the analysis results, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search)-based POI recommendation algorithm to recommend POIs to LBSN users that can also incorporate the impact of the social relationships on recommendations. We evaluate our proposed model on Foursquare dataset and compare our results with the latest POI recommendation algorithm. The experimental results show that our approach performs better.},

Even though this strategy yields satisfactory results, it still does not fully exploit the similarity information among users and items. Our work tries to model user-to-user and user-to-item relation as a probability distribution using a novel approach based on Rejection Sampling in order to decide on its next step (biased random walk). Some initial results on reference datasets reveal the potential of this idea.},

abstract = {Social interactions preceding and succeeding trust formation can be significant indicators of formation of trust in online social networks. In this research we analyze the social interaction trends that lead and follow formation of trust in these networks. This enables us to hypothesize novel theories responsible for explaining formation of trust in online social settings and provide key insights. We find that a certain level of socialization threshold needs to be met in order for trust to develop between two individuals. This threshold differs across persons and across networks. Once the trust relation has developed between a pair of characters connected by some social relation (also referred to as a character dyad), trust can be maintained with a lower rate of socialization.Our first set of experiments is the relationship prediction problem. We predict the emergence of a social relationship like grouping, mentoring and trading between two individuals over a period of time by looking at the past characteristics of the network. We find that features related to trust have very little impact on this prediction. In the final set of experiments, we predict the formation of trust between individuals by looking at the topographical and semantic social interaction features between them. We generate three semantic dimensions for this task which can be recomputed with an observed social variable (say grouping) to create a new semantic social variable. In this endeavor, we successfully show that, including features related to socialization, gives us an approximate increase of 4--9% accuracy for trust relationship predictions.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of reciprocation is of great interest in sociology and computational social science. The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2 game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that reciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our hypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations with features from trade interactions. Incorporating the number of trades (both before and after the initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be reciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC. More generally, we see strong correlations across the different networks and emphasize that network dynamics, such as reciprocation, cannot be studied in isolation on just a single type of connection.},

abstract = {We model the emergence and propagation of reputations in social networks with a novel distributed algorithm. In social networks, reputations of agents (nodes) are emerged and propagated through interactions among the agents and through intrinsic and extrinsic consensus (voting) among neighbors influenced by the network topology. Our algorithm considers the degree information of nodes and of their neighbors to combine consensus in order to model how reputations travel within the network. In our algorithm, each node updates reputations on its neighbors by considering past interactions, computing the velocity of the interactions to measure how frequent the interactions have been occurring recently, and adjusting the feedback values according to the velocity of the interaction. The algorithm also captures the phenomena of accuracy of reputations decaying over time if interactions have not occurred recently. We present two contributions through experiments: (1) We show that an agent's reputation value is influenced by the position of the agent in the network and the neighboring topology; (2) We also show that our algorithm can compute more accurate reputations than existing algorithms especially when the topological information matters. The experiments are conducted in random social networks and Autonomous Systems Networks to find malicious nodes.},

abstract = {When faced with the task of forming predictions for nodes in a social network, it can be quite difficult to decide which of the available connections among nodes should be used for the best results. This problem is further exacerbated when temporal information is available, prompting the question of whether this information should be aggregated or not, and if not, which portions of it should be used. With this challenge in mind, we propose a novel utilization of variograms for selecting potentially useful relationship types, whose merits are then evaluated using a Gaussian Conditional Random Field model for node attribute prediction of temporal social networks with a multigraph structure. Our flexible model allows for measuring many kinds of relationships between nodes in the network that evolve over time, as well as using those relationships to augment the outputs of various unstructured predictors to further improve performance. The experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of using particular relationships to boost performance of unstructured predictors, show that using other relationships could actually impede performance, and also indicate that while variograms alone are not necessarily sufficient to identify a useful relationship, they greatly help in removing obviously useless measures, and can be combined with intuition to identify the optimal relationships.},

We apply our proposed methods to both binary and multi-class classification of sports and political interests of Twitter users and compare the performance against eight conventional classification methods using textual features. Experimental results using 2.56 million tweets show that our best binary and multi-class approaches improve the classification accuracy over the best baseline binary and multi-class approaches by 15% and 142%, respectively.},

abstract = {Social networks are naturally represented as heterogeneous networks with multiple types of objects e.g., actors, items and multiple types of links e.g., links between actors that denote social ties e.g., friendship, and links that connect actors to items e.g., photos, videos, articles, etc. that denote relationships between actors and items. In this paper, we consider the task of assigning labels to the unlabeled actors (individuals) in a large heterogeneous social network in which labels are available for a subset of actors. Specifically, we seek to learn a predictive model to label actors based on the attributes of the actors themselves and/or items that are linked to them in the network. Unfortunately, the number of distinct items, represented in real-world networks such as Facebook or Flickr is quite large (in the millions) although only a small subset of them are linked to specific actors. This leads to data sparsity which causes over-fitting and hence poor performance in predicting the labels of unlabeled actors. To address this problem, we induce hierarchical taxonomies over items and use the resulting taxonomies as a basis for selecting abstract and hence parsimonious representations of network data for learning the predictive models. Our experiments using three different predictors (Iterative classification Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, Iterative classification Logistic Regression, and EdgeCluster) on two real-world data sets, Last.fm and Flickr, show that the predictive models that take advantage of abstract representations of network data are competitive with, and in some cases, outperform those that do not.},

abstract = {Facebook, the most popular Online social network is a virtual environment where users share information and are in contact with friends. Apart from many useful aspects, there is a large amount of personal and sensitive information publicly available that is accessible to external entities/users. In this paper we study the public exposure of Facebook profile attributes to understand what type of attributes are considered more sensitive by Facebook users in terms of privacy, and thus are rarely disclosed, and which attributes are available in most Facebook profiles. Furthermore, we also analyze the public exposure of Facebook users by accounting the number of attributes that users make publicly available on average. To complete our analysis we have crawled the profile information of 479K randomly selected Facebook users. Finally, in order to demonstrate the utility of the publicly available information in Facebook profiles we show in this paper three case studies. The first one carries out a gender-based analysis to understand whether men or women share more or less information. The second case study depicts the age distribution of Facebook users. The last case study uses data inferred from Facebook profiles to map the distribution of worldwide population across cities according to its size.},

abstract = {In recent years, social media has changed the way we interact and communicate. Although the existing structure of social media allows users to easily create, receive, and propagate pieces of information, many a time, users do not have background knowledge about the received information, including the provenance (sources or originators) of information, and other recipients who may have retransmitted or modified the information. Providing such additional context to the received information can help users know how much value, trust, and validity should be placed in received information. To judge the credibility of the received piece of information, it is vital to know who are its sources, and how information propagates from sources to other social media users.In this paper, we are studying a novel research problem that facilitates a few known recipients to recover other unknown recipients, and seek the provenance of information. The experimental results with Facebook and Twitter datasets show that the proposed algorithm is effective in correctly recovering the unknown recipients and seeking the provenance of information.},

abstract = {In this paper the influence of interventions on Twitter users is studied. We define influence in a) number of participants, b) size of the audience, c) amount of activity, and d) reach. Influence is studied for four different target groups: a) politicians, b) journalists, c) employees and d) the general public. Furthermore, two types of interventions are studied: a) by all Twitter users (i.e., uncontrolled interventions), and b) those tweeted by an organization that benefits from any resulting influence (i.e., controlled interventions). As a case study, tweets about a large Dutch governmental organization are used.Results show a clear relation between the number of uncontrolled interventions and influence in all four target groups, for each of the defined types of influence. Controlled interventions show less influence: Significant influence was found for the general public, but influence for politicians and employees was only mildly significant, and no influence was found for journalists. The effect found for uncontrolled interventions however suggests that this influence is indeed reachable for some target groups, even when the number of interventions is small, and very well reachable for all target groups, provided the number of interventions is large enough.In addition to this we found that interventions influence groups to a different extent. Own employees were influenced strongest, differing significantly from the other groups.},

To account for this volume, researchers often use automated analysis and visualization techniques to produce a high-level overview of a Twitter stream. Existing techniques for understanding Twitter data make use of hashtags or word-pairs and may ignore the complex trends in discussions over time. To remedy this, we present an application of statistical topic modeling and alignment (binned topic models) to group related tweets into automatically generated topics and TopicFlow, an interactive tool to visualize the evolution of these topics. The effectiveness of this visualization for reasoning about large data sets is demonstrated by a usability study with 18 participants.},

abstract = {Twitter is presently utilized as a channel of communication and information dissemination. At present, government and non-government emergency management organizations utilize Twitter to disseminate emergency relevant information. However, these organizations have limited ability to evaluate the Twitter communication in order to discover communication patterns, key players, and messages that are being propagated through Twitter regarding the event. More importantly there is a general lack of knowledge of who are the individuals or organizations that disseminate warning information, provide confirmations of an event and associated actions, and urge others to take action. This paper presents a methodology that shows how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Network Analysis (SNA) can aid in addressing these issues. The methodology, in addition to qualitative data collected during on-site interviews and publicly available information, was successfully applied to a Twitter data set collected during 2011 Japan tsunami. NLP techniques were applied to extract actionable messages. Based on the messages extracted by NLP, SNA was used to construct a network of actionable messages. While SNA discovered communities and extracted the community leaders, NLP was used to determine the behavior of the community members and the role of the community leaders. Therefore, the proposed methodology automatically finds communities, evaluates its members' behaviors, and authenticates cohesive behaviors of the community members during emergencies. Moreover, the methodology efficiently finds the leaders of the communities, while also identifying their role in communities.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of semantically meaningful group detection within a sub-community of twitter micro-bloggers by utilizing a topic modeling, multi-objective clustering approach. The proposed group detection method is anchored on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique, aiming at identifying clusters of twitter users that are optimal in terms of both spatial and topical compactness. Specifically, the group detection problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem taking into consideration two complementary cluster formation directives. The first objective, related to spatial compactness, is achieved by minimizing the overall deviation from the corresponding cluster centers. The second, related to topical compactness, is achieved by minimizing the portion of probability mass assigned to low probability topics for the corresponding cluster centroids. In our approach, optimization is performed by employing a multi-objective genetic algorithm, which results in a variety of cluster structures that are significantly more interpretable than cluster assignments obtained with traditional single-objective clustering algorithms.},

For example, commercial organizations can use gender classification for advertising. Law enforcement may use gender classification as part of legal investigations. Others may use gender information for social reasons. Here we explore language independent gender classification. Our approach predicts gender using five color-based features extracted from Twitter profiles (e.g., the background color in a user's profile page). Most other methods for gender prediction are typically language dependent. Those methods use high-dimensional spaces consisting of unique words extracted from such text fields as postings, user names, and profile descriptions. Our approach is independent of the user's language, efficient, and scalable, while attaining a good level of accuracy. We prove the validity of our approach by examining different classifiers over a large dataset of Twitter profiles.},

abstract = {An important area of social networks research is identifying missing information which is not explicitly represented in the network, or is not visible to all. Recently, the Missing Node Identification problem was introduced where missing members in the social network structure must be identified. However, previous works did not consider the possibility that information about specific users (nodes) within the network could be useful in solving this problem. In this paper, we present two algorithms: SAMI--A and SAMI--N. Both of these algorithms use the known nodes' specific information, such as demographic information and the nodes' historical behavior in the network. We found that both SAMI--A and SAMI--N perform significantly better than other missing node algorithms. However, as each of these algorithms and the parameters within these algorithms often perform better in specific problem instances, a mechanism is needed to select the best algorithm and the best variation within that algorithm. Towards this challenge, we also present OASCA, a novel online selection algorithm. We present results that detail the success of the algorithms presented within this paper.},

However, its privacy-related issues, especially for neighborhood-based CF methods, can not be overlooked. The aim of this study is to address the privacy issues in the context of neighborhood-based CF methods by proposing a Private Neighbor Collaborative Filtering (PNCF) algorithm. The algorithm includes two privacy-preserving operations: Private Neighbor Selection and Recommendation-Aware Sensitivity. Private Neighbor Selection is constructed on the basis of the notion of differential privacy to privately choose neighbors. Recommendation-Aware Sensitivity is introduced to enhance the performance of recommendations. Theoretical and experimental analysis are provided to show the proposed algorithm can preserve differential privacy while retaining the accuracy of recommendations.},

Subsequently, we define a new item prediction method which makes use of both user-to-user similarity and item-to-item similarity. Experimental outcomes on Last.fm show some positive results that attest the efficiency of our proposed approach.},

By aggregating and visualizing email traffic between organizational units at various levels, we derive several insights into how large subdivisions of the organization interact with each other and with outside organizations. In the second part of the paper, we propose a power law model for predicting degree distribution of organizational email traffic based on hierarchical relationships between managers and employees. This model considers the influence of global email announcements sent from managers to all employees under their supervision, and the role support staff play in generating email traffic, acting as agents for managers.},

One approach to tackle this issue is by applying community discovery methods in egocentric networks to automatically generate friend circles for the user. There is however a discrepancy between the predicted circles and the circles that the user has in mind. A deep rooted reason is that it only makes sense when the circles are considered under certain usage. We designed and implemented an exploratory visualization tool that can help users determine the visibilities of their online posts. More specifically, we first examined the state-of-the-art community discovery methods for egocentric networks, then proposed a new visualization design with fine-grained control for the user to interact with the circles and make visibility decisions. Finally, we conducted an experimental user study evaluating the usefulness of this design.},

We analyzed 12 million transactions by 370 thousand insiders spanning 1986 to 2012, the largest reported in academia. We explore the temporal and network-centric aspects of the trading behaviors of insiders, and make surprising and counter-intuitive discoveries. We study how the trading behaviors of insiders differ based on their roles in their companies, the transaction types, the company sectors, and their relationships with other insiders.Our work raises exciting research questions and opens up many opportunities for future studies. Most importantly, we believe our work could form the basis of novel tools for financial regulators and policymakers to detect illegal insider trading, help them understand the dynamics of the trades and enable them to adapt their detection strategies towards these dynamics.},

This view presents each company as if it operates independently from its surroundings. However, a company can be more effectively evaluated when it is viewed not in isolation, but in the context of its network of customers and suppliers. Here we describe a system developed for GE Capital that enables sales representatives to analyze a target company's network of business relationships to gain deeper insights into its status. Mining company networks enables novel approaches to generating sales leads by taking advantage of information about the health and status of the suppliers and customers to which the company is linked. The system allows sales reps to visualize company networks and provides a variety of filters and views to mine the network information. This gives the sales reps deeper insights into their prospect pool, enabling them to be more knowledgeable and generate more actionable sales leads.},

abstract = {As social networks offer a vast amount of additional information to enrich standard learning algorithms, the most challenging part is extracting relevant information from networked data. Fraudulent behavior is imperceptibly concealed both in local and relational data, making it even harder to define useful input for prediction models. Starting from expert knowledge, this paper succeeds to efficiently incorporate social network effects to detect fraud for the Belgian governmental social security institution, and to improve the performance of traditional non-relational fraud prediction tasks. As there are many types of social security fraud, this paper concentrates on payment fraud, predicting which companies intentionally disobey their payment duties to the government. We introduce a new fraudulent structure, the so-called spider constructions, which can easily be translated in terms of social networks and included in the learning algorithms. Focusing on the egonet of each company, the proposed method can handle large scale networks. In order to face the skewed class distribution, the SMOTE approach is applied to rebalance the data. The models were trained on different timestamps and evaluated on varying time windows. Using techniques as Random Forest, logistic regression and Naive Bayes, this paper shows that the combined relational model improves the AUC score and the precision of the predictions in comparison to the base scenario where only local variables are used.},

Furthermore the users profiles and the description of jobs are divided into several parts called fields.Our experiments suggest that to predict the users interests for jobs, using basic similarity measures together with their interactions data collected by Work4 can be improved upon.The second part of this study presents a method to estimate the importance of each field of users and jobs in the task of job recommendation.Finally, the third part is devoted to the use of a machine learning algorithm in order to improve the results obtained with similarity measures: we trained a linear SVM (Support Vector Machines). Our results show that using this supervised learning procedure increases the performance of our content-based recommender system.},

abstract = {The popularity of social media sites like Twitter and Facebook opens up interesting research opportunities for understanding the interplay of social media and e-commerce. Most research on online behavior, up until recently, has focused mostly on social media behaviors and e-commerce behaviors independently. In our study we choose a particular global e-commerce platform (eBay) and a particular global social media platform (Twitter). We quantify the characteristics of the two individual trends as well as the correlations between them. We provide evidences that about 5% of general eBay query streams show strong positive correlations with the corresponding Twitter mention streams, while the percentage jumps to around 25% for trending eBay query streams. Some categories of eBay queries, such as 'Video Games' and 'Sports', are more likely to have strong correlations. We also discover that eBay trend lags Twitter for correlated pairs and the lag differs across categories. We show evidences that celebrities' popularities on Twitter correlate well with their relevant search and sales on eBay. The correlations and lags provide predictive insights for future applications that might lead to instant merchandising opportunities for both sellers and e-commerce platforms.},

abstract = {The Profile of Mood States (POMS) and its variations have been used in many real world contexts to assess individuals behavior and measure mood. Social Networks such as Twitter and Facebook are considered precious research sources of collecting user mood measurements. In particular, we are inspired in this paper, by recent work on the prediction of the stock market movement from attributes representing the public mood collected from Twitter. In this paper, we build a new prediction model for the same stock market problem based on single models combination. Our proposed approach to build such model is simultaneously promoting performance and interpretability. By interpretability, we mean the ability of a model to explain its predictions. We implement our approach using Ant Colony Optimization algorithm and we use customized Bayesian Classifiers as single models. We compare our approach against the best Bayesian single model, model learned from all the available data, bagging and boosting algorithms. Test results indicate that the proposed model for stock market prediction performs better than those derived by alternatives approaches.},

While it is intuitive that such interactions may generate patterns, it is difficult to identify and characterize them in satisfactory detail. In this paper, we propose using a combination of dynamic graphs and time-series to study the dynamics and collective behaviors in microblogging. To enable automatic pattern identification, a distance metric is developed to incorporate the heterogeneous aspects of the dynamical interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a month long Twitter dataset and show that the new representation and distance metric are both essential for discovering the patterns of collective microblogging, such as propagation of breaking news, advertisement, social movement, and interest group formation.},

abstract = {Digital recruitment is increasingly becoming a popular avenue for identifying human subjects for various studies. The process starts with an online ad that describes the task and explains expectations. As social media has exploded in popularity, efforts are being made to use social media to recruit for new career opportunities. Particularly, LinkedIn and Twitter have enabled an emerging trend for matching individuals with possible opportunities based on their interests. This makes finding more relevant jobs easier for both employees and employers. There are, however, many unanswered questions about how best to do that.In this paper, we propose an innovative Twitter-based recruitment system for a smoking cessation nicotine patch study. The goals of the paper are to (1) provide the system specification and design, (2) propose the approach we have taken to solve the problem of digital recruitment, (3) present two new algorithms, one for Twitter user ranking and the other for digital recruitment using social media, and (4) present the promising outcome of the initial version of the system and summarize the results. This is the first effort to introduce a practical solution for digital recruitment campaigns that is large-scale, inexpensive, efficient and reaches out to individuals in real-time as their needs are expressed.A continuous update on how our system is performing, in real-time, can be viewed at https://twitter.com/TobaccoQuit.},

abstract = {Access to massive real-time user generated personal information from micro blogging services, such as Twitter and Facebook, has the potential to enable new location-based recommendation and advertising services. However, sparse user profile information and low adoption of per-message geo-coordinate information necessitates development of location detection techniques that exposes a user's location from message content. We propose and evaluate content-based machine learning techniques to a) identify tweets containing a user's location, and, b) categorize a user location into the author's present or future location. Such an approach is advantageous because it a) relies purely on message content, b) can be used to predict a user's future presence at a location, c) relates user locations to some context (activities, trip plans, etc.), and, d) can be used to profile users constantly evolving location. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can identify and categorize user locations from message content with high accuracy. We also extract the time entities associated with a user's future location to show when the user would be at that location. Finally we illustrate the location-based data analytics potential of these techniques on two real-world datasets.},

abstract = {How does malware propagate? Does it form spikes over time? Does it resemble the propagation pattern of benign files, such as software patches? Does it spread uniformly over countries? How long does it take for a URL that distributes malware to be detected and shut down?In this work, we answer these questions by analyzing patterns from 22 million malicious (and benign) files, found on 1.6 million hosts worldwide during the month of June 2011. We conduct this study using the WINE database available at Symantec Research Labs. Additionally, we explore the research questions raised by sampling on such large databases of executables; the importance of studying the implications of sampling is twofold: First, sampling is a means of reducing the size of the database hence making it more accessible to researchers; second, because every such data collection can be perceived as a sample of the real world.Finally, we discover the SharkFin temporal propagation pattern of executable files, the GeoSplit pattern in the geographical spread of machines that report executables to Symantec's servers, the Periodic Power Law (Ppl) distribution of the life-time of URLs, and we show how to efficiently extrapolate crucial properties of the data from a small sample. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the largest study of propagation patterns of executables.},

abstract = {Question answering (Q&amp;A) communities have been gaining popularity in the past few years. The success of such sites depends mainly on the contribution of a small number of expert users who provide a significant portion of the helpful answers, and so identifying users that have the potential of becoming strong contributers is an important task for owners of such communities.We present a study of the popular Q&amp;A website StackOverflow (SO), in which users ask and answer questions about software development, algorithms, math and other technical topics. The dataset includes information on 3.5 million questions and 6.9 million answers created by 1.3 million users in the years 2008--2012. Participation in activities on the site (such as asking and answering questions) earns users reputation, which is an indicator of the value of that user to the site.We describe an analysis of the SO reputation system, and the participation patterns of high and low reputation users. The contributions of very high reputation users to the site indicate that they are the primary source of answers, and especially of high quality answers. Interestingly, we find that while the majority of questions on the site are asked by low reputation users, on average a high reputation user asks more questions than a user with low reputation. We consider a number of graph analysis methods for detecting influential and anomalous users in the underlying user interaction network, and find they are effective in detecting extreme behaviors such as those of spam users. Lastly, we show an application of our analysis: by considering user contributions over first months of activity on the site, we predict who will become influential long-term contributors.},

We describe our experience of deploying this system in a network analytics company for use in data analysis and presentation tasks. As social influence seems to be a factor in mobile telecommunications churn (the decision of a subscriber to leave a particular service provider), the visualization is based on a social network inferred from calling data between subscribers. Using this network, churn components, or groups of churners who are connected in the social network, are segmented out and trends in their static and dynamic attributes are visualized. ChurnVis helps analysts understand trends in these components in a way that respects the data privacy constraints of the service provider. Through this two pipeline approach, we are able to visualize thousands of churn components filtered from a social network of hundreds of millions of edges.},

abstract = {Recently, Cyberlocker services have gained great popularity in the file-sharing market. Driven by tremendous benefits a large number of files such as popular movies are uploaded to Cyberlockers. We explore the profit chain of file-sharing networks based on Cyberlockers and find that an important issue is how to collect the download URLs of popular files stored at different Cyberlockers and share them with public users. In this paper, we focus on these sites collecting and sharing the Cyberlocker URLs of movies, called Cyberlocker URL-sharing sites. First, we extract 1,587 URL-sharing sites based on 31,525 valid pages returned by Google search and demonstrate that the quality distribution of these sites follows a power-law. Second, we analyze the link citations among URL-sharing sites and build the directed link citation graph. By characterizing basic metrics of the graph, such as cited strength and in/out-degree, we understand the structure of URL-sharing sites in depth. Furthermore, we discover that Cyberlocker URLs can be disseminated dynamically through crawler mechanisms among different sites, and highlight the implications of such metrics in this context. Additionally, we study the security risks of 1,587 URL-sharing sites. The results show that security risks do exist when surfing 155 suspicious URL-sharing sites such as myrls.me and rapid4me.com although the majority sites (90.23%) are safe. Finally, some preliminary suggestions are discussed from the industry point of view for how to improve the effectiveness of searching, collecting and disseminating Cyberlocker URLs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the measurement and understanding of Cyberlocker URL-sharing sites.},

abstract = {Complexity is usually referred to as the degree of interrelatedness of components within a system. This paper explores the interrelatedness of components within complex social networks by using social network concepts adapted from 'structural holes' theory. Analogous to Shannon's Entropy, the study operationalises 'interrelatedness' in terms of the extent to which network ties transmit information that is unique and non-redundant based on structural positions of components within a complex social network. We term this index the 'Information Redundancy Index' (IRI), developed by combining structural holes measures of 'efficiency' and 'constraint' to determine the extent of redundant information exchange between components. The study then demonstrates how 'Information Redundancy', as a proxy for complexity, can be used to associate with project worker performance in terms of interrelatedness. It is hypothesized that higher levels of 'Information Redundancy' within an individual's social network have a detrimental effect on individual performance. Empirical results, from a pilot study of 17 real estate agents show a significant negative correlation between 'efficiency' and performance providing partial support for the hypothesis. These results are promising by paving the way for future studies to use social network metrics to capture system-level interactions that emerge in complex social systems. This has significant implications for future development of a practical managerial toolkit for project professionals in an increasingly complex world.},

abstract = {This research paper covers the development of an HIV risk scorecard using SAS Enterprise Miner™. The HIV risk scorecard was developed using the 2007 South African annual antenatal HIV and syphilis seroprevalence data. Antenatal data contains various demographic characteristics for each pregnant woman, such as pregnant woman's age, male sexual partner's age, race, level of education, gravidity, parity, HIV and syphilis status. The purpose of this research was to use a scorecard to rank the effects of the demographic characteristics on influencing an individual's risk of acquiring an HIV infection, not the probability of being sick. The project encompassed the selection of the data sample, classing, selection of demographic characteristics, fitting of a regression model, generation of weights-of-evidence (WOE), calculation of information values (IVs), creation and validation of an HIV risk scorecard. The educational level and syphilis status of the pregnant women produced information values below 0.05 and were rejected from inclusion in the final HIV risk scorecard. Based on their respective information values, the following four demographic characteristics of the pregnant women were found to be of medium predictive strength and thus included in the final HIV risk scorecard; age, age of male sexual partner, gravidity and parity. The age of the pregnant woman had the highest information value and Gini coefficient. The HIV risk scorecard showed that the risk of contracting an HIV infection increased gradually up to the age of 30 years for females and 34 years old for their male sexual partners. Thereafter, the risk decreased gradually towards the age of 45.},

abstract = {High-throughput mass spectrometers can produce thousands of peptide spectra from a single complex protein sample in a short amount of time. These data sets contain a substantial amount of redundancy (i.e. the same peptide is selected and identified multiple times in a single experiment) from peptides that may get selected multiple times in the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiment. The data from these mass spectrometers contain a substantial number of spectra that have low signal to noise (S/N) ratio and may not get interpreted due to poor quality. Recently, we presented a graph theoretic algorithm, CAMS (<u>C</u>lustering <u>A</u>lgorithm for <u>M</u>ass <u>S</u>pectra) for clustering mass spectrometry data. CAMS utilized a novel metric, called a F-set, that allows accurate identification of the spectra that are similar with much higher accuracy and sensitivity than if single peak comparisons were performed. In this paper we present a multithreaded algorithm, called P-CAMS, for clustering of mass spectral data on multicore machines. The algorithm relies on intelligent matrix completion for graph construction and a load-balancing scheme for substantial speedups. We study the scalability performance of the proposed parallel algorithm on a multicore machine using synthetically generated spectra with parameters carefully chosen to mimic real-world mass spectrometry datasets. Real experimental datasets were also generated for quality assessment of the clustering results from the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithms have scalable runtime performances and gives clustering results similar to a serial algorithm. The study also provides insight into the design of high performance algorithms for irregular problems in proteomics on many-core architectures.},

This framework provides an empirical foundation that can be adopted for better understanding and characterizing aggregate complexity in healthcare systems through the use of social network measures. Complexity is defined as the interrelatedness of components within a system. For instance, healthcare systems are characterized as complex adaptive system as they consist of multidisciplinary teams that have strong interdependences as healthcare professionals are required to coordinate effectively and share resources for positive patient outcomes. This aggregate complexity framework can be used to capture the number of components (e.g. professionals, technology, other artifacts etc.) and the degree of interrelatedness between the components (the level of influence the components have on one another) within a system. The contribution that this study makes to the field is 1) better understanding of aggregate complexity and coordination 2) a theoretical model which can be used to further understand the challenges of care coordination in cancer settings and 3) practical implications for aggregate complexity framework for envisioning organizations and healthcare systems.},

As the healthcare industry considers solutions, attention should be given to the Cloud and the considerable investment that has been made related to the establishment of digital identities and making them interoperable across heterogeneous systems. This research considered how the Cloud could be leveraged by healthcare providers to not only provide patients with a familiar way of accessing electronic resources but also creating a significant cost savings for providers. An examination was performed of similar work being done in other industries as well as the standards laid out by the federal government for EHRs and digital identities. This research lays out a comprehensive framework for healthcare providers to easily follow to integrate with the Cloud for identity validation, while meeting compliance guidelines for security and privacy. To demonstrate the viability of this research, a number of pilots and proof of concept projects have already been implemented at a large regional hospital and have produced immediate and tangible improvements.},

abstract = {Interest in extracting information from biomedical documents has increased significantly in recent years but has always been challenged by the ambiguity of natural language. An important source of ambiguity is the usage of polysemous words: words with multiple meanings. Word sense disambiguation algorithms attempt to solve this problem by finding the correct meaning of a polysemous word in a given context, but very few algorithms were designed to disambiguate biomedical text. In this study we propose a word sense disambiguation algorithm focused on biomedical text. The proposed algorithm does not need to be trained and uses a relatively small knowledge base.},

abstract = {Information technology is advancing faster than anticipated. The amount of data captured and stored in electronic form by far exceeds the capabilities available for comprehensive analysis and effective knowledge discovery. There is always a need for new sophisticated techniques that could extract more of the knowledge hidden in the raw data collected continuously in huge repositories. Biomedicine and computational biology is one of the domains overwhelmed with huge amounts of data that should be carefully analyzed for valuable knowledge that may help uncovering many of the still unknown information related to various diseases threatening the human body. Biomarker detection is one of the areas which have received considerable attention in the research community. There are two sources of data that could be analyzed for biomarker detection, namely gene expression data and the rich literature related to the domain. Our research group has reported achievements analyzing both domains. In this paper, we concentrate on the latter domain by describing a powerful tool which is capable of extracting from the content of a repository (like PubMed) the parts related to a given specific domain like cancer, analyze the retrieved text to extract the key terms with high frequency, present the extracted terms to domain experts for selecting those most relevant to the investigated domain, retrieve from the analyzed text molecules related to the domain by considering the relevant terms, derive the network which will be analyzed to identify potential biomarkers. For the work described in this paper, we considered PubMed and extracted abstracts related to prostate and breast cancer. The reported results are promising; they demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {The early development of medical decision support systems (appeared as expert systems (ES)) mainly focused on, among others, rule-based reasoning (RBR) and decision table/tree (DT) methods as problem solving strategies. These efforts were novel at the time; however, as these methodologies applied to more complex situations, the construction of knowledge base (e.g. rules, cases and 'models') for specific problem solving tasks becomes difficult and time consuming. Remedies to these difficulties have been sought, aiming at better knowledge modeling, knowledge acquisition, and extending the problem solving paradigm to distributed architectures. Alternatively, case-based reasoning (CBR) provides a different problem solving paradigm. In CBR, the knowledge is seen as cases that contain explicit and implicit aspects of the knowledge for solving a problem. The CBR methodology works in a practical way, and the reasoning is based on recalled knowledge memory of solved cases. To alleviate the difficulty of knowledge (case) acquisition and construction, this paper presents a design of a template case store, called MedCase. MedCase utilizes the semantic web technologies and supports a distributed CBR system architecture. MedCase promotes an open and accessible architecture for common CBR tasks in a virtual Healthcare Enterprise environment. MedCase will also allow the construction and sharing of cases that facilitate the development of distributed CBR-based medical decision support systems.},

abstract = {The current practice of designing microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LoCs) limits reusing designs and makes sharing tasks among researchers difficult. One way to achieve that objective is to borrow best practices from engineering. Also it takes a lot of skills to design LoCs. Design-by-assembly in which a LoC can be designed by configuring, laying out subsystems can help new researchers to develop custom chips. Flexible, reusable, and rapid-prototyping-feasible LoC designs can be achieved by fabricated modular microfluidic blocks. However, challenging problems still persist, which limit the usefulness of prefabricated blocks. We propose software microfluidic modules (SoftMABs) based design technique to solve issues fabricated modules face. By configuring SoftMABs, integrating them, the new assembly of SoftMABs can form a 3D LoC design ready to be prototyped. The proposed method can make designing a complex LoC less challenging, and collaborating among laboratories easier. We created SoftMABs and designed a custom microfluidic chip by assembling SoftMABs like LEGOs, dragging-and-dropping them. Later we reconfigured them - by replacing a SoftMAB with another module - to make a new LoC. We believe this computer-aided method is an interesting and useful LoC design technique.},

This work aims to model a data warehouse where images and their related sequences are gathered and analyzed for decision making purposes such as disease evolution surveillance. The images' features are gathered as intrinsic features representing both the content-based and the description-based descriptors combined to the experts' annotations.

However, the training approaches for optometrists are not yet on par with the latest technological evolution. The traditional supervisor-student training mode could not provide good immersion and repeatability, while most existing vision-based computer-assisted simulations provide even worse immersion on screens. In this paper, we propose an effective system for optometry training simulation with two major components: augmented reality and haptics. These components are integrated with the actual slit lamp and are able to greatly enhance the immersion for typical optometry training tasks such as foreign body removal. Medical doctors are also involved in suggesting configurations and validating visual and haptic rendering results. Preliminary user studies show very positive feedbacks from optometry students.},

As an ongoing joint research with the City Hospital in Saskatoon, Canada, we focus on providing real-time accessibility of the medical record in the mobile environment. We propose a cloud-hosted middleware which performs macro activities such as medical services composition, data hoarding, and medical data events management. The evaluation of the framework, called Med App, shows that medical data dissemination can be achieved in a low-latency fashion.},

abstract = {Adopting mobile technologies in assisting healthcare is opening new possibilities in medical health domain through bringing a dramatic shift from conventional paper-based tracking to electronic tracking and evaluation system. Health information systems have the potential to offer greater improvement in collecting and accessing relevant information, disseminating data among health practitioners and patients in a reliable and secure manner with faster speed and analyzing them efficiently. In this paper we have proposed and implemented a prototypical client-server based health information framework that allows both clinicians and patients to send data to a centralized backend system database and have access to those data when needed. Our framework adopts mobile electronic pain diary named PInGO for juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients to report their health conditions to the clinicians. Our framework offers secure, reliable and fast dissemination and access of these data through leveraging the latest push-based Web technology and RESTful web services. From our preliminary experiment results it has been observed that data dissemination using RESTful web services within event-based publish-subscribe domain provides greater performance improvement comparing to traditional pull-based data dissemination over Web.},

abstract = {Complexity is generally accepted to be the interrelatedness of components within a system. Treating the general practitioner (GP)-patient encounter as a complex system, we argue that complexity (resulting from the degree of interactions between GP, colleagues, patient) determines the performance of GPs, measured by attitudes to responsibility for their decisions about patient treatment. In this paper, we propose the use of social network measures of 'density' and 'inclusiveness' for computing the 'interrelatedness' of components within a complex system. We also suggest the use of 'number of components' (NoC) and 'degree of interrelatedness' (DoI) to plot the complexity profiles for each GP. Results from a sample of 107 GPs show that GPs with simple profiles (i.e. low NoC &amp; low DoI), compared to those in non-simple profiles, indicate a higher responsibility for the decisions they make in medical care. In conclusion, we argue that social networks-based complexity profiles are useful for understanding responsibility-taking in primary care. We highlight a number of interesting insights and practical implications for healthcare professionals.},

However, OSN services also introduce new threats and privacy issues regarding the data they are dealing with. For instance, in a reliable OSN service, a user should be able to set up his desired level of information sharing and securely manage sensitive data. Currently, few approaches exist that can model OSNs for the purpose, let alone model the effects that attackers can have on these networks. In this work a novel OSN modeling approach is presented to fill the gap. This model is based on an innovative game theoretical approach and it is analyzed both from a theoretical and simulation-oriented view. The game theoretic model is implemented in order to analyze several attack scenarios. As the results show, there are several scenarios where OSN services are very vulnerable and hence more protection mechanisms should be provided in order to secure the data contained across these networks.},

Influential language is characterized by increased positivity, complete absence of negativity, increased abstraction, and lack of reference to the opposing candidate(s). The way in which language use changes suggests that it is the result of changing self-perception rather than a deliberate strategy. This has implications for the language of influence as deployed by violent extremist groups, suggesting that both success at convincing an audience to participate in violent extremism and the presence of competing groups trying to make similar arguments improve the quality of the influencing language they use.},

The analyzed data, collected with the help of an automatic social media monitoring software, includes the perpetrator's page saved at the time the bombing suspects' names were made public, and the subsequently appearing comments left on that page by other users. The analyses suggest that a timely protection of online media records of a criminal could help prevent a large-scale public spread of communication exchange pertaining to the suspects/criminals' ideas, messages, and connections.},

abstract = {New topics of discussion emerge continuously as political and cultural environments shift. These topics can convey a range of ideas, stories, values, and shared experiences. In open source data, discourse is often infused with emotionally-charged prose expressed by large and diverse pools of authors. Manually identifying and analyzing the emotional content of combined discussions from millions of individuals is an impossible task for any single analyst or decision maker. Technologies that can automatically identify emerging topics of discussion and align them with public opinions can provide early warning to acts of violence or other threats [1]. We present an approach to detecting basic emotions associated with topics by combining work in topic modeling with affect analysis. We apply the correspondence LDA topic model (CorrLDA2) [2] to correlate emotional states with topics. Using this technique, topics have associated emotions and emotion categories are correlated over a corpus of text.},

Choice of crime location, time and similarity of crime committing methods between criminals are other important factors.

abstract = {The automatic detection of orientation and emotions in texts is becoming increasingly important in the Web 2.0 scenario. There is a considerable need for innovative techniques and tools capable of identifying and detecting the attitude of unstructured text. The paper tackles two crucial aspects of the sentiment classification problem: first, the computational complexity of the deployed framework; second, the ability of the framework itself to operate effectively in heterogeneous commercial domains. The proposed approach adopts empirical learning to implement the sentiment-classification technology, and uses a distance-based predictive model to combine computational efficiency and modularity. A suitably designed semantic-based metric is the cognitive core that measures the distance between two user reviews, according to the sentiment they communicate. The framework ultimately nullifies the training process; at the same time, it takes advantage of a classification procedure whose computational cost increases linearly when the training corpus increases. To attain an objective measurement of the actual accuracy of the sentiment classification method, a campaign of tests involved a pair of complex, real-world scoring domains; the goal was to compare the predicted sentiment scores with actual scores provided by human assessors. Experimental results confirmed that the overall approach attained satisfactory performances in terms of both cross-domain classification accuracy and computational efficiency.},

We develop a grid search algorithm for computing such equilibria, and provide experimental validation using three payoff matrices filled in by experts in India-Pakistan relations. The resulting system, called PREVE, allows us to analyze the equilibria thus generated and suggest policies to reduce attacks by LeT. We briefly discuss the suggested policies and identify their strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract = {Emergency resources are often insufficient to satisfy fully the demands for professional help and supplies after a public disaster. Furthermore, in a mass casualty situation, the emphasis shifts from ensuring the best possible outcome for each individual patient to ensuring the best possible outcome for the greatest number of patients. Historically, various manual and electronic medical triage systems have been used both under civil and military conditions to determine the order and priority of emergency treatment, transport, and best possible destination for the patients [3][4][5][6]. Unfortunately, none of those solutions has proven flexible, accurate, scalable or unobtrusive enough to meet the public's expectations [1]. We demonstrate a system for real-time patient assessment which uses mobile electronic triaging accomplished via crowdsourced and sensor-detected information. With the use of our system, emergency management professionals receive most of the information they need for preparing themselves to perform a timely and accurate treatment of their patients even before dispatching a response team to the event. During our demonstration, we will show how our system behaves with different combinations of information inputs and compare its resulting outputs with evaluations done by medical experts. The public will be given the chance to participate in real-time demos by posing as victims and providing self-reported information about their health.},

The edges are reduced further using uniform random spanning tree. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated to preserve the community structure that is characterized by the Network Community Profile (NCP).

Team science networks have certain unique characteristics in their conception and intent that set them apart from other commonly studied social and collaboration networks. We study the structural properties, and present metrics for collaborative performance assessment in two real-world team science networks initiated by the Army Research Lab. We model a team using a higher-order generalization of an edge called a simplex. A simplex captures group relationships distinct from the union of pairwise relationships. Our evaluation using a rigorous methodology reveals that the distributions of vertex and facet degrees (the number of maximal groups that a vertex belongs to) follow a power law, but with exponential cut-off at the tail in most cases. We propose metrics for quantitatively assessing the extent of intra-team and extra-team collaborations, and compare their effectiveness vis-a-vis our intuitive notions. Our work can be used as the basis for generative models, and for evaluating the collaborative performance of team science networks.},

In recent years, however, human resources have become highly mobile, making it more difficult for organizations to accurately learn their competencies. In such environment, organizations need to rely significantly on third parties to provide them with useful information about individuals. These sources and the information they provide, however, vary in degrees of trust and validity. In a previous paper, we developed an ontology for skills and competencies and modeled and analyzed the various sources of information used to derive the belief in an individual's level of competency. In this paper, we present an approach based on social network analysis for identifying unreliable sources of competency information. We explore the conditions under which evaluations given by an individual or a group about another can be trusted.

abstract = {Smart marketing models could utilize communities within the social Web to target advertisements. However, providing accurate community partitions in a reasonable time is challenging for current online large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance community detection in online social networks using node similarity techniques. We apply these techniques on unweighted social networks to detect community structure. Our proposed approach creates a virtual network based on the original social network. Virtual edges are added during this pre-processing step based on nodes' similarity in the original social network. Hence, a virtual link is established between any two similar nodes. Then the landmark CNM algorithm is applied on the generated virtual network to detect communities. This approach, labelled Similarity-CNM is expected to further maximize the quality of the inferred communities in terms of modularity and detection speed. Our experimental evaluation study asserts these gains, which accuracy is supported by a study based on Normalized Mutual Information Measure to determine how similar are the actual communities in the original network and the ones found by the proposed approach in this paper.},

abstract = {Citation analysis is a popular area of research, which has been usually used to rank the authors and the publication venues of research papers. With huge number of publications every year, it has become difficult for the users to find relevant publication materials. One simple solution to this problem is to detect communities from the citation network and recommend papers based on the common membership in communities. But, in today's research scenario, many researchers' fields of interest spread into multiple research directions resulting in an increasing number of interdisciplinary publications. Therefore, it is necessary to detect overlapping communities for relevant recommendation.In this paper, we represent publication information as a tripartite 'Publication Hypergraph' consisting of authors, papers and publication venues (conferences/journals) in three partitions. We then propose an algorithm called 'OverCite', which can detect overlapping communities of authors, papers and venues simultaneously using the publication hypergraph and the citation network information. We compare OverCite with two existing overlapping community detection algorithms, Clique Percolation Method (CPM) and iLCD, applied on citation network. The experiments on a large real-world citation dataset show that OverCite outperforms other two algorithms. We also present a simple paper search and recommendation system. Based on the relevance judgements of the users, we further prove the effectiveness of OverCite over other two algorithms.},

abstract = {Social networks are platforms where millions of users interact frequently and share variety of digital content with each other. Users express their feelings and opinions on every topic of interest. These opinions carry import value for personal, academic and commercial applications, but the volume and the speed at which these are produced make it a challenging task for researchers and the underlying technologies to provide useful insights to such data. We attempt to extend the established OLAP(On-line Analytical Processing) technology to allow multidimensional analysis of social media data by integrating text and opinion mining methods into the data warehousing system and by exploiting various knowledge discovery techniques to deal with semi-structured and unstructured data from social media.The capabilities of OLAP are extended by semantic enrichment of the underlying dataset to discover new measures and dimensions for building data cubes and by supporting up-to-date analysis of the evolving as well as the historical social media data. The benefits of such an analysis platform are demonstrated by building a data warehouse for a social network of Twitter, dynamically enriching the underlying dataset and enabling multidimensional analysis.},

In this paper, we describe a system to automatically monitor and analyze customer feedback through various social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and detect issues faced by the customers. Business organizations can use this system to engage with their customers and help alleviate the problems faced by them. The system uses statistical event detection techniques for identifying various customer issues. The system offers a batch version as well as real time version of event detection algorithm depending upon the client's requirements.

abstract = {The proliferation of social networks in digital media has proved to be fruitful, but this rise in popularity is accompanied by user privacy concerns. Social network data has been published in various ways and preserving the privacy of individuals in the published data has become an important concern. Several algorithms have been developed for privacy preservation in relational data, but these algorithms cannot be applied directly to social networks as the nodes here have structural properties along with labels. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to achieve k-anonymity and l-diversity in social network data which provides structural anonymity along with sensitive attribute protection. The proposed algorithm uses novel edge addition techniques which are also presented in this paper. We also propose a concept of partial anonymity to reduce anonymization cost for d&gt;1. The empirical study shows that our algorithm requires significantly less number of edge additions for anonymization of social network data and has a substantially lower running time than the other algorithms previously proposed in the field.},

Subsequently, our system computes the energy of each collected event dataset, and then encapsulates ranked temporal, spatial and topical keywords into a structured node for event-entity extraction, in order to learn and update event ontologies for fast response of emergent events. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate that our developed system is workable, allowing for prediction of possible evolution for early warning of critical incidents with a dynamic ontology engineering.},

abstract = {Online social networks and microblogging platforms have collected a huge number of users this last decade. On such platforms, traces of activities are automatically recorded and stored on remote servers. Open data deriving from these traces of interactions represent a major opportunity for social network analysis and mining. This leads to important challenges when trying to understand and analyse these large-scale networks better. Recently, many sociological concepts such as friendship, community, trust and reputation have been transposed and integrated into online social networks. The recent success of mobile social networks and the increasing number of nomadic users of online social networks can contribute to extending the scope of these concepts. In this paper, we transpose the notion of the Familiar Stranger, which is a sociological concept introduced by Stanley Milgram. We propose a framework particularly adapted to online platforms that allows this concept to be defined. Various application fields may be considered: entertainment, services, homeland security, etc. To perform the detection task, we address the concept of familiarity based on spatio-temporal and attribute similarities. The paper ends with a case study of the well-known microblogging platform Twitter.},

abstract = {Social Networks promote information sharing between people everywhere and at all times. Mining data produced in this data-rich environment can be extremely useful. Frequent itemset mining plays an important role in mining associations, correlations, sequential patterns, causality, episodes, multidimensional patterns, max-patterns, partial periodicity, emerging patterns, and many other significant data mining tasks in social networks. With the exponential growth of social network data towards a terabyte or more, most of the traditional frequent itemset mining algorithms become ineffective due to either huge resource requirements or large communications overhead. Cloud computing has proved that processing very large datasets over commodity clusters can be done by providing the right programming model. As a parallel programming model, MapReduce, one of most important techniques for cloud computing, has emerged in the mining of datasets of terabyte scale or larger on clusters of computers. In this paper, we propose an efficient frequent itemset mining algorithm, called IMRApriori, based on MapReduce framework which deals with Hadoop cloud, a parallel store and computing platform. The paper demonstrates experimental results to corroborate the theoretical claims.},

abstract = {Over the years, online social networks (OSNs) have become popular form of networks for people to create and maintain networks of friends, to share knowledge/interests, and to publish content on a massive scale. The popularity of such OSNs has formed a virtual platform for viral marketing of contents, products, target advertising, and political campaigns. The amount of work dedicated to studying information diffusion in OSNs has increased in recent years. Past research has clearly shown that diffusion of information in social networks depends on both the nature of the information and the structure of the network. In this study, we focus on one of the structural properties, tie strength, in the flow of information through social networks.Several studies have shown that weak ties can act as bridges, linking disconnected groups in the network, which, in turn, allows information to diffuse between subgroups. However, not all weak ties are "good" weak ties in the network. In this study, we want to prove that a weak tie helps in the spread of information, when a "good" weak tie is selected. Specifically, we proposed a simple mechanism to select "good" weak ties in each step of the propagation process. We simulate our mechanism on data collected from two blog networks (wretch.cc and tribe.com) and a Facebook network, and found that an appropriate weak tie can improve the diffusion of information.},

Among those social networking websites, Facebook is the most popular website that has most users. However, in Facebook, the abusing problem is a very critical issue, such as Hate Groups. Therefore, many researchers are devoting on how to detect potential hate groups, such as using the techniques of social networks analysis. However, we believe content is also a very important factors for hate groups detection. Thus, in this paper, we will propose an architecture to for hate groups detection which is based on the technique of Social Networks Analysis and Web Mining (Text Mining; Natural Language Processing). From the experiment result, it shows that content plays an critical role for hate groups detection and the performance is better than the system that just applying social networks analysis.},

abstract = {Mixing patterns in social networks can give us important clues about the structure and functionality of these networks. In the past, a number of measures including variants of assortativity have been used to quantify degree mixing patterns of networks. In this paper, we are interested in observing the heterogeneity of the neighbourhood of nodes in networks. For this purpose, we use the standard deviation of degree differences between a node and its neighbours. We call this measure the 'versatility' of a node. We apply this measure on synthetic and real world networks. We find that among real world networks three classes emerge -(i) Networks where the versatility converges to non-zero values with node degree (ii) Networks where the versatility converges to zero with node degree (iii) Networks where versatility does not converge with node degree. We find that there may be some correlation between this and network density, and the geographical / anatomical nature of networks may also be a factor. We also note that versatility could be applicable to any quantifiable network property, and not just node degree.},

However, detecting social topics in the era of information explosion requires state-of-the-art analytics techniques. The geographic clustering analysis based on social topics across provinces, i.e., states, has rarely been studied. Using the Twitter data collected in the United States (US), we detected the social hot topic by using the ratio of word frequency. Also, we found geographic communities by correlating the time series for a set of topic words across US states. The result of the geographic clustering was visualized using the Google Fusion Table. In conclusion, the ratio of word frequency properly detects social topics or breaking news while suppressing daily tweeted small talks or emotional words such as lol, like, and love. We have also demonstrated that a clustering algorithm based on a social topic can be useful in classifying social communities.},

The research question is that what kinds of activity and network variables explain the changes over time within a friendship network? At what stages are these variables important? A network survey was carried out in a classroom of a high school. The subjects were 45 high school students of 28 boys and 17 girls. Sociometric data were collected by having each student nominate up to 16 intimate classmates. These nominations were measured their gender and common activities including chatting, participating students' club, going to cram, having dinner, discussing homework, playing game, heart to heart talking, going to movie, shopping, and outdoor sport. Panel data was collected 10 times across 3 semesters from Sep. 2008 to Jan. 2010. The program SIENA was applied to estimate the models for the evolution of social networks and daily activities. Results showed that heart to heart talk had effect on friendship formation in the beginning of the first 2 semesters, going to cram and sporting had effects on keeping friendship between 2 semesters, and going to cram, club, and sporting had effects at the end of observations. It is concluded that each daily activity has specific effect on friendship initiation, maintaining, and continue at different stage for adolescents, and the mechanism is discussed.},

abstract = {Ever-increasing emergence of location-aware ubiquitous devices has facilitated collection of time-stamped mobility data. This large volume of data not only provides trajectory information but also information about social interaction between individuals. Unlike trajectory representation and discovery, discovery of social ties and interactions hidden in mobility data has not yet been fully explored. To identify such interaction, social network analysis has been recently used. However, compared with data from emails, phone calls, and messages, which are commonly used for social network analysis, mobility data convey less information about interaction between entities. Therefore, identifying the type of tie between two entities using only mobility data is a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the strength and type of social ties between people only based on their spatio-temporal correlations. Using mutual information metric, we propose utilization of two types of measures for identifying the purpose of being in a certain location. Our experimental results using a location-aware sensing device show that our method can identify different social ties between various entities successfully.},

They sustain and improve their health status with exercise, diet control, adopt good sleep habit, keep natural patterns on sleeping and bowel movement. These people need a tool for monitor and record long-termly their own health status. On the other hand, some people do not see they need to change their health related lifestyle to improve their health status until they are diagnosed with diseases. While he/she is sick, he/she also need to write down their health diary he/herself or the caregiver (most of them are the disadvantaged in their family) for the physician to monitor the illness.In this paper we proposed a social network service named HowCare, a caregiver based social support online community, with a personal health cloud archive and its unique designs with "HealthRank" algorithm to match caregiver's social network with correlated illness situation they face to.The aim of HowCare are, to help people keep their own health data on the cloud and allows patients or caregiver with the same disease to interact with each other, and through the social network and telehealth design, it will influence the patient's willingness to accept healthier life and improve health status},

New methods and algorithms are constantly developed towards maximizing reach of the campaigns and increasing their effectiveness. One of the important research directions in this area is related to selecting initial nodes of the campaign to result with maximizing its effects represented as total number of infections. To achieve this goal, several strategies were developed and they are based on different network measures and other characteristics of users. The problem is that most of these strategies base on static network properties while typical online networks change over time and are sensitive to varying activity of users. In this work a novel strategy is proposed which is based on multiple measures with additional parameters related to nodes availability in time periods prior to the campaign. Presented results show that it is possible to compensate users with high network measures by others having high frequency of system usage, which, instead, may be easier or cheaper to acquire.},

Social network analysis has been an active research field for many decades; however, most of the early work employed very small datasets. In this paper, a number of issues with traditional practices of social network analysis in the context of dynamic, large-scale social networks are pointed out. Given the continuously evolving nature of modern online social networking, we postulate that social network analysis solutions based on incremental algorithms will become more important to address high computation times for large, streaming, over-time datasets. Incremental algorithms can benefit from early pruning by updating the affected parts only when an incremental update is made in the network. This paper provides an example of this case by demonstrating the design of an incremental closeness centrality algorithm that supports efficient computation of all-pairs of shortest paths and closeness centrality in dynamic social networks that are continuously updated by addition, removal, and modification of nodes and edges. Our results obtained on various synthetic and real-life datasets provide significant speedups over the most commonly used method of computing closeness centrality, suggesting that incremental algorithm design is a fruitful research area for social network analysts.},

abstract = {The extensive use of digital social media by social movement actors is an emerging trend that restructures the communication dynamics of social protest, and it is widely credited with contributing to the successful mobilizations of recent movements (e.g., Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street). Yet, our understanding of both the roles played by social movement's use of social media and the extent of its impact is largely derived from anecdotal evidence, news reports, and a thin body of scholarly research on web-based technologies. In this research we explore several computational methods for measuring the impact of social media on a social movement. Inspired by methodologies originally developed for analyzing computer networks and other dynamic systems, these methods measure various static and dynamic aspects of social networks, and their relations to an underlying social movement. We demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of these measurement methods in the context of Twitter and the Occupying Wall Street movement (OWS). By analyzing tweets related to OWS, we demonstrated the link between the vitality of the movement and the volume of the related tweets over time. We show that there is a positive correlation between the dynamic of tweets and the short-term trend of OWS. The correlation makes it possible to forecast the short-term trend of a social movement using social media data. By ranking users based on the number of their OWS-related tweets and the durations of their tweeting, we are able to identify "buzz makers". Using a strategy similar to the page-rank algorithm, we define the influence of a user by the number of re-tweets that his/her original tweets incite. By tracing where OWS-related tweets are generated, we measure the geographic diffusion of OWS. By analyzing the percentage of OWS tweets generated from different sources, we show that smart phones and applications such as tweet deck had been used extensively for tweeting in the OWS movement. This indicates the involvement of a younger and more technology-inclined generation in OWS.},

abstract = {It is difficult for the users to reach the most appropriate and reliable item for them among vast number of items and comments on these items. Recommendation systems and trust/reputation systems are one of the solutions to deal with this problem with the help of personalized services. These systems suggest items to the user by estimating the ratings that user would give to them. Use of trust data for giving recommendation has emerged as a new way for giving better recommendations. In the literature, it is shown that trust based recommendation approaches perform better than the ones that are only based on user similarity, or item similarity. In this paper, a comparative review of recommendation systems, trust/reputation systems, and their combined usage is presented. Then, a sample trust based agent oriented recommendation system is proposed and its effectiveness is justified with the help of some experiments.},

The distributed functionality and lack of having a central control in MAS and DSS may cause to emerge new behaviors in the execution time. This unexpected behavior which was not seen in the requirements is known as emergent behavior and may cause irreparable damages. Detection of these emergent behaviors is more valuable and cost effective in the early phases compared to detecting them after the deployment. In this paper we propose a new technique for the detection of a specific type of emergent behavior in the design phase. We take the advantage of social network visualization in this method. The novelty and direct advantage of this technique is presenting the exact point and cause of emergent behavior.},

It allows to determine which characteristics describing communities have importance from the point of view of their future behaviour. Knowledge about the probable future career of the community aids in the decision concerning investing in contact with members of a given community and carrying out actions to achieve a key position in it. It also allows to determine effective ways of forming opinions or to protect group participants against such activities. In the paper, a new approach to group identification and prediction of future events is presented together with the comparison to existing method. Performed experiments prove a high quality of prediction results. Comparison to previous studies shows that using many measures to describe the group profile, and in consequence as a classifier input, can improve predictions.},

abstract = {In relational learning tasks such as within network classification the main problem arises from the inference of nodes' labels based on the the ground true labels of remaining nodes. The problem becomes even harder if the nodes from initial network do not have any labels assigned and they have to be acquired. However, labels of which nodes should be obtained in order to provide fair classification results? Active learning and inference is a practical framework to study this problem. The method for active learning and inference in within network classification based on node selection is proposed in the paper. Based on the structure of the network it is calculated the utility score for each node, the ranking is formulated and for selected nodes the labels are acquired. The paper examines several distinct proposals for utility scores and selection methods reporting their impact on collective classification results performed on various real-world networks.},

abstract = {In the last few decades social networking sites have encountered their first large-scale security issues. The high number of users associated with the presence of sensitive data (personal or professional) is certainly an unprecedented opportunity for malicious activities. As a result, one observes that malicious users are progressively turning their attention from traditional e-mail to online social networks to carry out their attacks. Moreover, it is now observed that attacks are not only performed by individual profiles, but that on a larger scale, a set of profiles can act in coordination in making such attacks. The latter are referred to as malicious social campaigns. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines authorship attribution techniques with a behavioural analysis for detecting and characterizing social campaigns. The proposed approach is performed in three steps: first, suspicious profiles are identified from a behavioural analysis; second, connections between suspicious profiles are retrieved using a combination of authorship attribution and temporal similarity; third, a clustering algorithm is performed to identify and characterise the suspicious campaigns obtained. We provide a real-life application of the methodology on a sample of 1,000 suspicious Twitter profiles tracked over a period of forty days. Our results show that a large set of suspicious profiles behaves in coordination (70%) and propagates mainly, but not only, trustworthy URLs on the online social network. Among the three largest detected campaigns, we have highlighted that one represents an important security issue for the platform by promoting a significant set of malicious URLs.},

At the macroscopic level, conclusions can be drawn, among others, about collective behavior and expertise in varying granularities (i.e. single employee to the company as a whole).},

This paper describes how citizens can serve as human sensors in providing supplementary, alternate, and complementary sources of information for smart cities. It presents a methodology, based on a probabilistic language model, to extract the perceptions that may be relevant to smart city initiatives from social media updates. Geo-tagged tweets collected over a two-month period from New York City are used to illustrate the potential of social media powered human sensors.},

abstract = {Long duration space flights such as a two and a half year mission to Mars present many unique challenges to the behavioral health of astronauts. Factors such as social monotony, workload, a confined environment, sensory deprivation, and limited access to family and psychosocial support can affect crew welfare and task performance. NASA recognizes a "risk of performance decrements due to inadequate cooperation, coordination, communication, and psychosocial adaptation within a team;" reports from Mir revealed that conflicts between crew members have resulted in early termination of missions. Currently, flight crews and support staff have real time voice and video communications capabilities on the International Space Station to keep astronauts connected, and allow operations staff to monitor the crew's well-being. However, communications for long duration missions will likely be limited and disrupted by time latencies. Crew workload may also prohibit crew members from providing the extensive self-reports that the Earth-bound support team needs to accurately access the crew's psychological health. Further, the metrics of interest are difficult to obtain because some are inherently qualitative, while others may not be amendable to self-reports. We first describe an extensive review of psycho-social dimensions relevant to long duration space flight, their manifestations, and possible detection methods. We then describe a novel method of non-intrusive detection developed initially for application in the Empire Challenge military exercise in 2010. This system, called ADMIRE for Assessment of Discourse Media Indicators of Relative Esteem, leverages prior work in cultural and socio-linguistic theory to develop standardized, non-intrusive methods for data collection and knowledge extraction about factors salient to group psychosocial dynamics. Finally, we describe our approach to follow-up work applying ADMIRE to historical space flight data, as well as in ongoing studies in space analog environments to identify potential changes in individual and team psycho-social factors before they lead to deficits in health and task performance.},

abstract = {Social networking sites pervade the World Wide Web and have millions of users worldwide. This provides ample opportunity for brands and organisations to reach out to a large and diverse audience. They do so by creating content and spreading it across the social network. Most popular social networks follow a timeline based homepage to display such content to the end users. Content once posted on the timeline, remains visible for a limited time, determined by the rate of content generation in the network. There are various ways by which brands can become more visible on the timeline of their followers, for instance by retransmitting/advertising their content from time to time. Hence, with multiple content creators in the network, there is a competition over a user's timeline, which we analyse in this paper. We first characterise the occupancy distribution of a given user's timeline and then use queueing techniques to analyse the period of time a content is present on a given timeline. We then study the competition between different content creators and characterise the equilibrium rate of content generation. We finally provide some numerical results, which provide insights into the effect of various system parameters.},

abstract = {One dimension on the Internet, which has gained great popularity in recent years are the online social networks (OSNs). Users all over the globe write, share, and publish personal information about themselves, their friends, and their workplace. In this study we present a method for infiltrating specific users in targeted organizations by using organizational social networks topologies and Socialbots. The targeted organizations, which have been chosen by us, were technology-oriented organizations. Employees from this kind of organization should be more aware of the dangers of exposing private information. An infiltration is defined as accepting a Socialbot's friend request. Upon accepting a Socialbot's friend request, users unknowingly expose information about themselves and their workplace. To infiltrate this we had to use our Socialbots in a sophisticated manner. First, we had to gather information and recognize Facebook users who work in targeted organizations. Afterwards, we chose ten Facebook users from every targeted organization randomly. These ten users were chosen to be the specific users from targeted organizations of which we would like to infiltrate. The Socialbots sent friend requests to all specific users' mutual friends who worked or work in the same targeted organization. The rationale behind this idea was to gain as many mutual friends as possible and through this act increase the probability that our friend requests will be accepted by the targeted users. We tested the proposed method on targeted users from two different organizations. Our method was able to gain a successful percentage of 50% and 70% respectively. The results demonstrate how easily adversaries can infiltrate users they do not know and get full access to personal and valuable information. These results are more surprising when we emphasize the fact that we chose oriented users who should be more aware to the dangers of information leakage for this study on purpose. Moreover, the results indicate once again that users who are interested in protecting themselves should not disclose information in OSNs and should be cautious of accepting friendship requests from unknown persons.},

abstract = {The amount of research done in the area of real--world networked systems is rapidly growing. Everybody knows what six degrees of separation or small--world phenomenon are. Scientists very easily give labels to the networks they analyse. If it has power law node degree distribution then it has to be scale--free network or if there is high clustering coefficient then it must be small--world network. These simplifications, although convenient, are not always very useful from the perspective of understanding phenomena existing within the network. In this paper we decided to go back to the basics and investigate whether analysis of one single measure is enough to describe a network. We analyse both local and global characteristics in order to discover the "true" nature of a network. Not only using local and/or global measures can lead to different classification of a network but we also show how significantly different interpretation can result from analysing the same data by building network models as directed/undirected and/or weighted/binary graphs.},

abstract = {Sophisticated Web robots sport a wide variety of functionality and visiting characteristics, constituting a significant percentage of the requests serviced by a Web server. Unlike human clients that retrieve information off a site by navigating links and ignoring irrelevant information, Web robots may collect many different types of resources, and employ varying navigation strategies to find the knowledge on the site they desire. Thus, the resource request patterns of their visits are unpredictable and cannot be inferred based on our knowledge of human request patterns. In this paper, we perform an analysis on the types of resources requested by Web robots using recent Web logs from an academic Web server. We study the distribution of response sizes and response codes, the types of resources requested, and popularity of resources for requests from Web robots. Throughout, we contrast our findings against human resource request patterns. We find reasons to suggest that robots severely handicaps the ability of Web server caches to operate with high performance.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new algorithm-FC-WPath, a fuzzy rule-based classification of weighted path traversals using fuzzy quantifiers for web usage mining. Web usage mining usually analyses frequent path traversals or frequent subgraphs where each path has the same level of importance. However, the current frequent pattern mining based methods could not distinguish the level of importance for different paths. Further, there is little work done in relation to classification of path traversals based on fuzzy classification inferences and fuzzy quantification, which often provides good readability and interpretation of complex patterns. In this work, we attach numeric weights to each path traversed according to some level of importance, therefore introducing quantitative and fuzzy values. The derived fuzzy if-then classification rules from weighted paths can then be described both by the linguistic fuzzy rules and linguistic quantifiers like "all", "some" etc. As a result, we propose a fuzzy subset-hood model with fuzzy quantifiers for describing the usual fuzzy if-then rules applied to web usage mining. The experimental result shows that the proposed FC-WPath algorithm has good classification accuracy, readability and runtime.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the network of expertise constructed from the interactions of users on the online question-answering (QA) community of Stack Overflow. This community was built with the intention of helping users with their programming tasks and, thus, questions are expected to be highly factual. This also indicates that the answers one provides may be highly indicative of one's level of expertise on the subject matter. Therefore, our main concern is how to model and characterize the user's expertise based on the constructed network and its centrality measures. We used the user's reputation established on Stack Overflow as a direct proxy to their expertise. We further made use of linear models and principal component analysis for the purpose. We found out that the current reputation system does a decent job at representing the user's expertise and that focus matters when answering factual questions. However, our model was not able to capture the other larger half of reputation which is specifically designed to reflect a user's trustworthiness besides their expertise. Along the way, we also discovered facts that have been known in earlier studies of the other/same QA communities such as the power-law degree distribution of the network and the generalized reciprocity pattern among its users.},

On the other hand, attributes of network structure around the individual, quantified through networks analysis metrics, were related to cognitive empathy. Further, an examination of the interplay between network structure, social capital and empathy suggests that empathy facilitates the relation between network structure and social capital previously reported in literature.

abstract = {In recent years, analysis of opinions from social web has witnessed a boom merely because such a volume of opinions is difficult to obtain through any other normal means of collecting opinion like surveys, polls etc. The analysis is interesting but at the same time difficult because of the sheer volume of information that the social media generates on the internet and the range of opinions possible to be expressed. Twitter is one such social media where opinions expressed play a significant influence on the marketability of a product. Hence, an accurate method for predicting sentiments could enable us to understand customers' preferences, their views on the product and services offered by the companies. These have the potential to create positive or negative wave in the market. Hence, this information is valuable for both companies and consumers. Enterprises can leverage this information for formalizing their strategies. The main focus of this paper is to analyze the sentiments expressed on Hollywood movies on Twitter so that customers' opinions, habits and preferences are extracted, analyzed and used to understand the market behaviour for better customer experience.},

abstract = {Substantial percent of global Internet users are now actively use Twitter. In recent times, Twitter has been experiencing explosive growth, attracting celebrities consequently a growing mass of user coverage. Insights of such a social network aid researchers in understanding behavioral dynamics of the society. Though there have been attempts to study social networks, they did not scale to process social networks on the scale of Twitter user-follower network. In this paper we uncovered some of the essential properties of the complete Twitter user-follower network. The properties include degree distribution, connectivity, strength of following relationships, clustering coefficient. Our investigations showed that the Twitter user-follower network follows power-law degree distribution. We found Twitter being a connected network. The strength of the relationships among users is distributed nearly uniform on the scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Nearly 90% of the users possess '0' clustering coefficient, which refers to the least possibility to find communities in the network. In addition to the listed properties, this study found communities of users with high clustering coefficient despite many users with low clustering coefficient. A sample of the communities is validated manually for accuracy. The validation proved that the communities are representing users of similar interests. The communities found from this work yields to friend recommendations, target based advertisements, etc.},

abstract = {Microblogging has become a popular means of communication and information diffusion. Due to the huge amount of microblogs generated daily, the communication and computing costs required for real hot event detection is a big challenge. Choosing a small subnet of nodes to detect events has received increasing research interests in recent years. But the previous methods manage to select nodes to cover all the events including less popular events in sample datasets under the limited subnet size, which cause a big difference of event detection ratio between sample events and online real events in microblogs. In this paper we propose a new subnet nodes selection scheme based on the event detection ratio and nodes' events participation probabilities. Under the requirement of average event detection ratio, we prefer to choose the nodes who are active in propagating hot events than the nodes who participate in the less popular events. And we take dynamic programming to accelerate the computing. The experimental results show that our proposed method has a better performance.},

In this paper, we present our results on the relationship between personality and users' movie preferences, and their opinions about, use of, and trust in recommender systems. Using surveys and analysis of system data for 73 Netflix users, we show correlations between personality and preferences for specific movie genres that replicate and extend previous results. Our most significant result is that the personality trait of Conscientious is consistently positively correlated with a higher opinion about the usefulness and trustworthiness of recommendations, self-reports of how frequently they were used, and ratings of recommended items. We discuss the implications these results have for evaluating and improving recommender systems.},

By examining users' #1 (best) and #2 (second-best) friends, we discover that MySpace users are nearly indifferent to these two friends' popularities when choosing which to designate as their best friend. Other pairs of ranks (e.g., #1-vs.-#3, #2-vs.-#3, ...) also reveal no marked preference for a popular friend over a less popular one. To the extent that ranking decisions form a window into broader decisions about whom to befriend at all, these observations suggest that positing individuals' tendency to attach to popular people---as in network-growth models like preferential attachment---may not suffice to explain the heavy-tailed degree distributions seen in real networks.},

However, because it is subjected to manipulations and therefore may be deceptive, some alternative methods for ranking Twitter users that take into account users' activities such as the tweet and retweet rate have been proposed. We show that there are two types of users possessing a large number of followers. The first type of user follows a small number of others. The second type of user follows almost as equally many others as the number of its followers. Then, we examine egocentric followership networks of users having many followers. We show, as an example, that users of the second type have higher link reciprocity on average than users of the first type. We conclude that the number of others that a user follows is as equally important as the number of followers when estimating the importance of a user in the Twitter blogosphere.},

Non-linear models are significantly better than their linear counterparts, which can be further slightly improved by the adoption of state-space models.},

abstract = {Networks in various application domains present an internal structure, where nodes form groups of tightly connected components which are more loosely connected to the rest of the network. Several attempts have been made to provide a formal definition to the generally described "community finding" concept, providing different approaches. Some algorithms follow an iterative approach starting by characterizing either the entire network, or each individual node as community, and splitting [1] or merging communities respectively, producing a hierarchical tree of nested communities, called dendrogram. Several researchers aim to find the entire hierarchical community dendrogram [1] while others wish to identify only the optimal community partition. Some researchers aim at discovering distinct (non-overlapping) communities, while others allow for overlaps [2]. The Blondel algorithm described by Blondel et al. in [3], follows a bottom-up approach. Each node in the graph comprises a singleton community. Two communities are merged into one if the resulting community has larger modularity value that both the initial ones. This is a fast and accurate algorithm which, detects all communities in the graph. In suffers however in the sense that it constantly, during its execution, requires the knowledge of a global information of the graph, namely the number of its edges (which change as the algorithm modifies the graph), limiting its distributed nature. The Infomap algorithm [4] transforms the problem of community detection into efficiently compressing the structure of the graph, so that one can recovered almost the entire structure from the compressed form. This is achieved by minimizing a function that expresses the tradeoff between compression factor and loss of information (difference between the original graph and the reconstructed graph).},

Community detection is an important problem in complex network which is useful in a variety of applications such as information propagation, link prediction, recommendations and marketing. In this paper, we focus on discovering overlapping community structure using link partition. We proposed a LDA-based link partition (LBLP) method which can find communities with adjustable range of overlapping. This method employs topic model to detect link partition, which can calculate the community belonging factor for each link. Based on the belonging factor, link partitions with bridge links can be found efficiently. We validate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthesized networks. The experiment results demonstrate that the approach can find meaningful and relevant link community structure.},

abstract = {Given a set of k networks, possibly with different sizes and no overlaps in nodes or links, how can we quickly assess similarity between them? Analogously, are there a set of social theories which, when represented by a small number of descriptive, numerical features, effectively serve as a "signature" for the network? Having such signatures will enable a wealth of graph mining and social network analysis tasks, including clustering, outlier detection, visualization, etc. We propose a novel, effective, and scalable method, called NETSIMILE, for solving the above problem. Our approach has the following desirable properties: (a) It is supported by a set of social theories. (b) It gives similarity scores that are size-invariant. (c) It is scalable, being linear on the number of links for graph signature extraction. In extensive experiments on numerous synthetic and real networks from disparate domains, NETSIMILE outperforms baseline competitors. We also demonstrate how our approach enables several mining tasks such as clustering, visualization, discontinuity detection, network transfer learning, and re-identification across networks.},

abstract = {Automatic detection of tweets that provide Location-specific information will be extremely useful in conveying geo-location based knowledge to the users. However, there is a significant challenge in retrieving such tweets due to the sparsity of geo-tag information, the short textual nature of tweets, and the lack of pre-defined set of topics. In this paper, we develop a novel framework to identify and summarize tweets that are specific to a location. First, we propose a weighting scheme called Location Centric Word Co-occurrence (LCWC) that uses the content of the tweets and the network information of the twitterers to identify tweets that are location-specific. We evaluate the proposed model using a set of annotated tweets and compare the performance with other weighting schemes studied in the literature. This paper reports three key findings: (a) top trending tweets from a location are poor descriptors of location-specific tweets, (b) ranking tweets purely based on users' geo-location cannot ascertain the location specificity of tweets, and (c) users' network information plays an important role in determining the location-specific characteristics of the tweets. Finally, we train a topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using a large collection of local news database and tweet-based Urls to predict the topics from the location-specific tweets and present them using an interactive web-based interface.},

abstract = {Traditional link prediction techniques primarily focus on the effect of potential linkages on the local network neighborhood or the paths between nodes. In this paper, we study the problem of link prediction in networks where instances can simultaneously belong to multiple communities, engendering different types of collaborations. Links in these networks arise from heterogeneous causes, limiting the performance of predictors that treat all links homogeneously. To solve this problem, we introduce a new link prediction framework, Link Prediction using Social Features (LPSF), which weights the network using a similarity function based on features extracted from patterns of prominent interactions across the network.},

We compare two algorithms which use temporal data at different stages during the search, and empirically demonstrate one to be significantly more efficient.},

abstract = {Attributed graphs can be described using two dimensions: first a structural dimension that contains the social graph, e.g. the actors and the relationships between them, and second a compositional dimension describing the actors, e.g. their profile, their textual publications, the metadata of the videos they share, etc. Each of these dimensions can be used to explain different phenomena occurring on the social network, whether from a connectivity or an thematic perspective. This paper claims that the integration of both dimensions would allow researchers to analyze real social networks from different perspectives. We present here a novel approach to the community detection problem with the integration of the two dimensions composing an attributed graph. We show how to integrate but also how to control the integration of two different partitions, one based on the links, the other one based on the attributes. The resulting partition exhibits interesting properties, such as dense and homogeneous groups of actors, revealing new types of communities to the analyst. Because we use a contingency matrix, and because the analyst may invent new ways of combining rows and columns, we open new perspectives for the exploration of attributed social networks.},

abstract = {Twitter has attracted millions of users that generate a humongous flow of information at constant pace. The research community has thus started proposing tools to extract meaningful information from tweets. In this paper, we take a different angle from the mainstream of previous works: we explicitly target the analysis of the timeline of tweets from "single users". We define a framework - named TUCAN - to compare information offered by the target users over time, and to pinpoint recurrent topics or topics of interest. First, tweets belonging to the same time window are aggregated into "bird songs". Several filtering procedures can be selected to remove stop-words and reduce noise. Then, each pair of bird songs is compared using a similarity score to automatically highlight the most common terms, thus highlighting recurrent or persistent topics. TUCAN can be naturally applied to compare bird song pairs generated from timelines of different users.By showing actual results for both public profiles and anonymous users, we show how TUCAN is useful to highlight meaningful information from a target user's Twitter timeline.},

Parameters are proposed to characterize different groupings behaviors and locations in time on the network modeled by a weighted temporal graph model. A container is detected as a critical path in the model within which, a persistent structure should be deeply encapsulated and balancing between the parameters. This is a largest stable and central composition throughout an observation period expressing significantly an identity which may be acquired to be a core structure. Such identity can be enhanced toward characterizing a more significant core identity around that, a developing process of dynamic social network occurs in time.},

abstract = {In an urban city, its transportation network supports efficient flow of people between different parts of the city. Failures in the network can cause major disruptions to commuter and business activities which can result in both significant economic and time losses. In this paper, we investigate the use of centrality measures to determine critical nodes in a transportation network so as to improve the design of the network as well as to devise plans for coping with network failures. Most centrality measures in social network analysis research unfortunately consider only topological structure of the network and are oblivious of transportation factors. This paper proposes a new centrality measure called DelayFlow that incorporates travel time delay and commuter flow volume. We apply the proposed measures on the Singapore's subway network and its about 2 million commuter trips per day, and compare them with traditional topology based centrality measures.},

abstract = {User attribute is an essential factor for personalized recommendation and targeted advertising. Therefore, there have been a number of studies to identify user attributes automatically from SNS postings, since the postings reveal various attributes of writers. Many kinds of machine learning methods have been applied to automatic identification of user attributes as a candidate solution, but they suffer from two major problems. First, there are many postings in SNS that do not deliver any information about writers. Then, learning from SNS postings results in a biased model by these irrelevant postings. Second, the postings of a SNS user are somewhat related one another. However, most machine learning methods ignore this information, since they assume that data are independently and identically distributed. In order to solve these problems in user attribute identification, this paper proposes a novel method based on non-i.i.d. multi-instance learning. Since multi-instance learning treats all postings by a user as a bag and learns user attribute identification with such bags, not with postings, the first problem is solved. In addition, the proposed method assumes that the postings by a single user have a structure. By incorporating this assumption into the multi-instance learning, the second problem is solved. Our experimental results show that consideration of these two problems in automatic user attribute identification results in performance improvement.},

abstract = {Shocks to regional, national and global systems stemming from natural hazards, acts of armed violence, terrorism and serious and organized crime have significant defence and security implications. Today, nations face an uncertain and complex security landscape in which threats impact/target the physical, social, economic and cyber domains. For example, acts of terrorism and organized crime are considered one of the greatest threats to national security. In the UK alone, the social and economic costs associated with organized crime are estimated between £20 and £40 billion per year (NCA, 2011: 4).Threats to national security, such as that against critical infrastructures not only stem from man-made acts but also from natural hazards. Katrina (2005), Fukushima (2011) and Hurricane Sandy (2012) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of critical infrastructures to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being of a community and a nation.With this dynamic and complex threat landscape, network analysis has emerged as a key enabler in supporting defence and security. With the advent of 'big data' and increasing processing power, network analysis can reveal insights with regards to structural and dynamic properties thereby facilitating greater understanding of complex networks, their entities, interdependencies and vulnerabilities.This poster paper introduces relevant theoretical frameworks and applications of network analysis in support of the defence and security domain. This paper reflects the body of contributions by leading researchers to an upcoming book entitled: Networks and Network Analysis for Defence and Security, Springer Publishing.},

Finally, the authors noted avenues that may be worth pursuing to increase accuracy in ChatSafe. "A System for the Automated Author Attribution of Text and Instant Messages" is the first publication on ChatSafe and is the first work of the undergraduate authors.},

abstract = {As criminals and terrorist employ social media platforms for planning and executing nefarious activities, understanding the degree of trustworthiness in interactions among actors becomes crucial for detecting their activities. Measuring trust in these environments can benefit analysts who are monitoring web forums to detect criminal or terrorist activities. Previous research proposed a trust model that could enable automatic trust discovery using speech act theory. This paper introduces a new classification method that enriches traditional techniques with contextual information. We conducted experiments to compare the proposed method with traditional approaches. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other alternative methods.},

abstract = {This paper is about a new methodology to automatically rebuild main paths from Flickr's traces. Our geotagged image metadata's corpus allows the construction of each photographer's timeline. The tourist's itinerary in the destination can then be reconstructed considering two modes: the fastest path and the most likely path. Major paths are directly extracted from the fusion of all itineraries. To illustrate the multi-scale efficiency of this work, several fields of study are presented: Berlin, the Loire Valley and the Palace of Versailles.},

abstract = {Understanding and mastering users role plays an important part in online public opinions tracking and electronic commerce marketing, etc. Different groups of users have different sociology attributes. Thus, it is very important and interesting to discover user role based on their sociology attributes. The present user role discovery methods are generally based on the structural features or static coarse-grained behavior features. In this paper, by analyzing a large number of real social network data, we propose a novel method for social role discovery based on sociology attributes features: we first mining and define several properties on behalf of sociology attributes; then, to deal with the sociology attributes features clustering, we use Bayesian information criterion as our stopping criterion; at last, the experimental results show that using this method can better understand user role in Sina Microblog. Besides, the methodology in this paper for user role discovery also can be applied to other social network in general.},

abstract = {In this paper we present preliminary results for a real time computer forensics agent that logs computer activity on a Windows computer system for subsequent forensic investigation. The agent, which is developed using the .NET 2010 framework includes six modules. Each module is dedicated to keep track and record a specific category of user activities. For instance, the Windows Event Watcher logs the Windows OS events and the Removable Devices Detector logs any external devices that are plugged in or removed from a system. Currently, the aforementioned two modules are implemented and tested with carefully designed scenarios using Windows XP and Windows 7 operating systems.},

The aim of our work is to propose an approach that will detect web profiles in a unique way and to model a print web for each profile. Our main concern is to find this signature from text messages in the forums, by analyzing the vocabulary used by each user. Also we will focus here on presenting our approach and our future work in a way that will allow us to detect the "Specific Vocabulary" for each web profile.},
