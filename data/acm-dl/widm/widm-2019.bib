abstract = {In recent past, there is a growing trend of interest among the downstream stakeholders of a dairy chain to receive milk (and dairy products) of high quality. Moreover, the rejection of milk and other dairy products by customers due to its poor quality has severe negative impacts on the dairy chain's upstream stakeholders. "Smart Farm" is a system for proactive management of raw milk quality in dairy farms. It aims to empower the dairy chain's stakeholders of milk farmers and logistics service providers with next-generation interactive artificial intelligence-based automated systems to be active participants in proactively managing raw milk quality and consequently, maximizing their expected benefits through maintaining higher quality for the milk they supply to the processor.},

abstract = {We approach the problem of identifying and interpreting clusters over different time scales and granularity in multivariate time series data. We extract statistical features over a sliding window of each time series, and then use a Gaussian mixture model to identify clusters which are then projected back on the data streams. The human analyst can then further analyze this projection and adjust the size of the sliding window and the number of clusters in order to capture the different types of clusters over different time scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two different application scenarios: (1) fleet management and (2) district heating, wherein each scenario, several different types of meaningful clusters can be identified when varying over these dimensions.},

abstract = {Discovering causal relations from limited amounts of data can be useful for many applications. However, all causal discovery algorithms need huge amounts of data to estimate the underlying causal graph. To alleviate this gap, this paper proposes a novel visualization tool which incrementally discovers causal relations as more data becomes available. That is, we assume that stronger causal links will be detected quickly and weaker links revealed when enough data is available. In addition to causal links, the correlation between variables and the uncertainty of the strength of causal links are visualized in the same graph. The tool is illustrated on three example causal graphs, and results show that incremental discovery works and that the causal structure converges as more data becomes available.},

abstract = {Predicting future maintenance needs of equipment can be addressed in a variety of ways. Methods based on machine learning approaches provide an interesting platform for mining large data sets to find patterns that might correlate with a given fault. In this paper, we approach predictive maintenance as a classification problem and use Random Forest to separate data readouts within a particular time window into those corresponding to faulty and non-faulty component categories. We utilize diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) as an example of event-based data, and propose four categories of features that can be derived from DTCs as a predictive maintenance framework. We test the approach using large-scale data from a fleet of heavy duty trucks, and show that DTCs can be used within our framework as indicators of imminent failures in different components.},

abstract = {Diagnosing deviations and predicting faults is an important task, especially given recent advances related to Internet of Things. However, the majority of the efforts for diagnostics are still carried out by human experts in a time-consuming and expensive manner. One promising approach towards self-monitoring systems is based on the "wisdom of the crowd" idea, where malfunctioning equipments are detected by understanding the similarities and differences in the operation of several alike systems.A fully autonomous fault detection, however, is not possible, since not all deviations or anomalies correspond to faulty behaviors; many can be explained by atypical usage or varying external conditions. In this work, we propose a method which gradually incorporates expert-provided feedback for more accurate self-monitoring. Our idea is to support model adaptation while allowing human feedback to persist over changes in data distribution, such as concept drift.},
