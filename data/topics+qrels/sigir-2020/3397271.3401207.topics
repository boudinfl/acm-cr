<title> Retrieving Potential Causes from a Query Event

<desc> Description:
A number of existing approaches extract cause-effect patterns using lexical, syntactic, and more recently, semantic relations [3â€“5, 12], primarily taken from headlines or single sentences. The cause-effect pattern approach was extended in [7], where a set of patterns are initially used to create a network of causes and effects, and then a relational embedding method is used to jointly embed causes and effects. Causal IR works in the reverse direction, where a query describes a cause (e.g., current situation or proposed action) and the results provide a list of possible effects was studied in [9, 10].
