<title> Bundle Recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks

<desc> Description:
Most existing works for bundle recommendation [2, 6, 7] regard item and bundle recommendation as two separate tasks, and associate them by sharing model parameters. A recent study [3] proposed a multi-task framework that transfers the benefits of the item recommendation task to the bundle recommendation to allevi- ate the scarcity of user-bundle interactions.

<title> Bundle Recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks

<desc> Description:
Although bundles are currently widely used everywhere, few efforts have been made in solving the bundle recommendation problem. List Recommendation Model (LIRE) [6] and Embedding Factorization Machine (EFM) [2] simultaneously utilized the usersâ€™ interactions with both items and bundles under the BPR framework. The Bundle BPR (BBPR) Model [7] made use of the parameters previously learned through an item BPR model. Recently, Deep Attentive Multi-Task Model (DAM) [3] jointly modeled user-bundle interactions and user-item interactions in a multi-task manner.

<title> Bundle Recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks

<desc> Description:
The basic idea of graph convolutional networks (GCN) [5] is to reduce the high-dimensional adjacency information of a node in the graph to a low-dimensional vector representation. With the strong power of learning structure, GCN is widely applied in recommender systems. [1] first applied GCN to the recommendation to factorize several rating matrices. [10] extended it to web-scale recommender systems with neighbor-sampling. Recently, [9] further approached a more general model that uses high-level connectivity learned by GCN to encode CF signals.
