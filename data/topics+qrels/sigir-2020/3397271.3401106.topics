<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
The value of evaluating information based on graded relevance has begun to receive attention in recent years both from system [40, 55] and user [2, 15, 48] point of views. This is particularly important since the granularity of relevance judgements in previous studies have been based on investigating this phenomenon indirectly, via some sort of mediator [29, 71]. This, therefore, limits the understanding of how searchers perceive different degrees of information relevance [55].

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Relevance is also known to be subjective and difficult to quantify [48] since it depends on a searcher’s perception of information relating to a specific Information Need (IN) at a certain point in time [8, 57]. However, given the semantic gap between a searcher’s IN and their formulated queries [7, 27, 52], IR systems have employed various techniques to capture the subjective aspect of relevance [2] to improve the effectiveness of retrieved results. Examples of such techniques are explicit [38], implicit (e.g. [24, 36]) and physiological [47] feedback.

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
More recently, researchers have shown the possibility of capturing the neural processes associated with relevance, using brain imaging techniques [2, 15, 16, 22, 25, 28, 33, 37, 48, 65]. These studies have either investigated relevance in the context of word associations (i.e. relevance of a word with respect to another) [15, 16, 65] without subjects experiencing any IN; or investigated relevance in the context of Information Retrieval (IR) when IN has been introduced to subjects. In the latter scenario, relevance was investigated only as a binary notion [2, 19, 22, 24, 25, 28, 37, 48, 49] leaving the graded nature of it unexplored.

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Relevance is the fundamental concept in IR [45, 57–59]. It plays a crucial role in the user-system interaction since it is a substantial indicator of system retrieval performance [8, 57]. Despite significant attention dedicated to examining this concept, relevance is still not fully understood, and it is a subject of many ongoing scientific debates. Past research has investigated the concept of relevance at different granularity levels from both the user [29, 71] and system [35, 40] perspective. Within the system side, graded relevance (in comparison to the binary one) has been shown to improve ranking functions [34, 55].

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Given the importance of the user side of relevance, IR systems have been employing mechanisms and techniques to capture this phenomenon, namely explicit and implicit feedback. Explicit feedback is easy to use, however, difficult to obtain due to the cognitive burden associated with it [47], as the user is required to explicitly state whether presented content is subjectively perceived as relevant or not [67]. Implicit feedback is an unobtrusive data collection method. Popular techniques used to measure implicit relevance feedback are, for example, dwell time (i.e. [36]), eye-tracking and pupillometry [24], and/or the measurements of affective [4, 47] and physiological signals [47]. However, implicit feedback is often found to be noisy, which decreases its accuracy [2].

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Recent research has begun to apply brain imaging methods to study aspects of the IR process from a neuroscience perspective. One particular area of emphasis for this research has been to examine the IN process [50, 51]. In addition, it has been found that prediction of the IN state experienced by a user is possible using brain signals [50]. Apart from IN, recent studies have employed brain imaging techniques to gain a better understanding of other parts of the information seeking and retrieval process, such as query formulation [28], search [49, 70] and relevance (e.g. [33]).

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Recent research using a neuroscience approach to investigate relevance might be categorised in two ways based on the context within which the relevance was measured. The first line of brain-imaging research has position relevance within the IR task. For instance, [48] employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to localise differences in brain activity in cortical regions during the processing of relevant vs non-relevant images. The research was able to identify regions engaged in the relevance judgement processing and the increased activation of these regions for relevant items was related to visuospatial working memory [49, 51].

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Relevance has been inferred using EEG [25] or in combination with pupillometry or/and eye-tracking devices [22] within the context of the IR task, not only for textual stimuli but also for videos [37] and images [2]. For instance, [2] examined the processing of relevant vs non-relevant images, finding the most significant differences to occur between 500 – 800ms. [37] explored the ERPs associated with topical relevance of video skims and classified the data based on two specific ERP components (N400 and P600), which have been shown to be indicators of relevant and non-relevant judgements. Moreover, recent findings have shown that relevance can be predicted in real-time from EEG brain signals and eye movements while the user engages with the system and IR task [28].

<title> The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance

<desc> Description:
Another line of research has examined relevance in the context of word associations, employing EEG in isolation, or in combination with eye gaze [15, 16, 65]. In these scenarios, participants did not experience IN, but they engaged in judging word association to the topic. The findings of these studies have shown that brain signals differ when subjects process relevant vs. non-relevant words across time [16].
